<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">A New Covenant with the American People </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Two hundred summers ago, this Democratic Party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the American Revolution - who once argued we should overthrow our own government every 20 years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">In 1992, the party Thomas Jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Our land reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from America's very soul - from the families in our bedrock neighborhoods, from the unsung, workaday heroes of the world's greatest democracy and economy. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">America is on the wrong track. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The American people are hurting. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The American Dream of expanding opportunity has faded. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Middle class families are working hard, playing by the rules, but still falling behind. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Poverty has exploded. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Our people are torn by divisions. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The last 12 years have been a nightmare of Republican irresponsibility and neglect. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">America's leadership is indifferent at home and uncertain in the world. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Republican mismanagement has disarmed government as an instrument to make our economy work and support the people's most basic values, needs and hopes. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The Republicans brought America a false and fragile prosperity based on borrowing, not income, and so will leave behind a mountain of public debt and a backbreaking annual burden in interest. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">It is wrong to borrow to spend on ourselves, leaving our children to pay our debts. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We hear the anguish and the anger of the American people. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We know it is directed not just at the Republican administrations that have had power, but at government itself. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Their anger is justified. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We can no longer afford business as usual -- neither the policies of the last 12 years of tax breaks for the rich, mismanagement, lack of leadership and cuts in services for the middle class and the poor, nor the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">It is time to listen to the grassroots of America, time to renew the spirit of citizen activism that has always been the touchstone of a free and democratic society. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Therefore we call for a revolution in government - to take power away from entrenched bureaucracies and narrow interests in Washington and put it back in the hands of ordinary people. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We vow to make government more decentralized, more flexible, and more accountable - to reform public institutions and replace public officials who aren't leading with ones who will. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The Revolution of 1992 is about restoring America's economic greatness. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We need to rebuild America by abandoning the something-for-nothing ethic of the last decade and putting people first for a change. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Only a thriving economy, a strong manufacturing base, and growth in creative new enterprise can generate the resources to meet the nation's pressing human and social needs. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy and foreign policy America can have. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The Revolution of 1992 is about putting government back on the side of working men and women - to help those who work hard, pay their bills, play by the rules, don't lobby for tax breaks, do their best to give their kids a good education and to keep them away from drugs, who want a safe neighborhood for their families, the security of decent, productive jobs for themselves, and a dignified life for their parents. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The Revolution of 1992 is about a radical change in the way government operates - </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">not the Republican proposition that government has no role, nor the old notion that there's a program for every problem, but a shift to a more efficient, flexible and results-oriented government that improves services, expands choices, and empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottom up. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">We believe in an activist government, but it must work in a different, more responsive way. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">The Revolution of 1992 is about facing up to tough choices. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">There is no relief for America's frustration in the politics of diversion and evasion, of false choices or of no choices at all. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Instead of everyone in Washington blaming one another for inaction, we will act decisively -- and ask to be held accountable if we don't. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,255)">Above all the Revolution of 1992 is about restoring the basic American values that built this country and will always make it great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, tolerance, faith, family and hard work. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,255)">We offer the American people not only new ideas, a new course, and a new President, but a return to the enduring principles that set our nation apart: the promise of opportunity, the strength of community, the dignity of work, and a decent life for senior citizens. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,255)">To make this revolution, we seek a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American people and their government, that will expand opportunity, insist upon greater individual responsibility in return, restore community, and ensure national security in a profoundly new era. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,254)">We welcome the close scrutiny of the American people, including Americans who may have thought the Democratic Party had forgotten its way, as well as all who know us as the champions of those who have been denied a chance. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(253,1,254)">With this platform we take our case for change to the American people. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(3,251,254)">I. OPPORTUNITY </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">Our Party's first priority is opportunity -- broad- based, non-inflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">Democrats in 1992 hold nothing more important for America than an economy that offers growth and jobs for all. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">President Bush, with no interest in domestic policy, has given America the slowest economic growth, the slowest income growth, and the slowest jobs growth since the Great Depression. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">And the American people know the long Bush recession reflects not just a business cycle, but a long-term slide, so that even in a fragile recovery we're sinking. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,255)">The ballooning Bush deficits hijacked capital from productive investments. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,255)">Savings and loan sharks enriched themselves at their country's expense. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">The stock market tripled, but average incomes stalled, and poverty claimed more of our children. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,255)">We reject both the do-nothing government of the last twelve years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,255)">Instead we offer a third way. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">Just as we have always viewed working men and women as the bedrock of our economy, we honor business as a noble endeavor, and vow to create a far better climate for firms and independent contractors of all sizes that empower their workers, revolutionize their workplaces, respect the environment, and serve their communities well. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">We believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">But economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy to invest in people. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,254)">For twelve years our country has had no economic vision, leadership or strategy. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(1,253,253)">It is time to put our people and our country first. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(226,28,28)">Investing in America. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">The only way to lay the foundation for renewed American prosperity is to spur both public and private investment. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We must strive to close both the budget deficit and the investment gap. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">Our major competitors invest far more than we do in roads, bridges, and the information networks and technologies of the future. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We will rebuild America by investing more in transportation, environmental technologies, defense conversion, and a national information network. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">To begin making our economy grow, the President and Congress should agree that savings from defense must be reinvested productively at home, including research, education and training, and other productive investments. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">This will sharply increase the meager nine percent of the national budget now devoted to the future. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will create a "future budget" for investments that make us richer, to be kept separate from those parts of the budget that pay for the past and present. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">For the private sector, instead of a sweeping capital gains windfall to the wealthy and those who speculate, we will create an investment tax credit and a capital gains reduction for patient investors in emerging technologies and new businesses. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">Support for Innovation. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will take back the advantage now ceded to Japan and Germany, which invest in new technologies at higher rates than the U. S.  and have the growth to show for it. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will make the R&;D tax credit permanent, double basic research in the key technologies for our future, and create a civilian research agency to fast-forward their development. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">The deficit. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Addressing the deficit requires fair and shared sacrifice of all Americans for the common good. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">In 12 Republican years a national debt that took 200 years to accumulate has been quadrupled. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Rising interest on that debt now swallows one tax dollar in seven. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">In place of the Republican supply-side disaster, the Democratic investment, economic conversion and growth strategy will generate more revenues from a growing economy. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We must also tackle spending, by putting everything on the table; eliminate nonproductive programs; achieve defense savings; reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs; cut federal administrative costs by 3 percent annually for four years; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">limit increases in the "present budget" to the rate of growth in the average American's paycheck; apply a strict "pay as you go" rule to new non-investment spending; and make the rich pay their fair share in taxes. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">These choices will be made while protecting senior citizens and without further victimizing the poor. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">This deficit reduction effort will encourage private savings, eliminate the budget deficit over time, and permit fiscal policies that can restore America's economic health. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Defense Conversion. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Our economy needs both the people and the funds released from defense at the Cold War's end. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will help the stalwarts of that struggle -- the men and women who served in our armed forces and who work in our defense industries – make the most of a new era. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will provide early notice of program changes to give commun ties, businesses and workers enough time to plan. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We will honor and support our veterans. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Departing military personnel, defense workers, and defense support personnel will have access to job retraining, continuing education, placement and relocation assistance, early retirement benefits for military personnel, and incentives to enter teaching, law enforcement and other vital civilian fields. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Redirected national laboratories and a new civilian research agency will put defense scientists, engineers and technicians to work in critical civilian technologies. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Small business defense firms will have technical assistance and transition grants and loans to help convert to civilian markets, and defense dependent communities will have similar aid in planning and implementing conversion. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will strongly support our civilian space program, particularly environmental missions. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">The Cities. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Only a robust economy will revitalize our cities. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">It is in all Americans' interest that the cities once again be places where hard-working families can put down roots and find good jobs, quality health care, affordable housing, and decent schools. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Democrats will create a new partnership to rebuild America's cities after 12 years of Republican neglect. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">This partnership with the mayors will include consideration of the seven economic growth initiatives set forth by our nation's mayors. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will create jobs by investing significant resources to put people back to work, beginning with a summer jobs initiative and training programs for inner-city youth. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We support a stronger community development program and targeted fiscal assistance to cities that need it most. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">A national public works investment and infrastructure program will provide jobs and strengthen our cities, suburbs, rural communities and country. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We will encourage the flow of investment to inner city development and housing through targeted enterprise zones and incentives for private and public pension funds to invest in urban and rural projects. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">While cracking down on redlining and housing discrimination, we also support and will enforce a revitalized Community Reinvestment Act that challenges banks to lend to entrepreneurs and development projects; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,1,0)">a national network of Community Development Banks to invest in urban and rural small businesses; and microenterprise lending for poor people seeking self-employment as an alternative to we fare. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,235,0)">Agriculture and the Rural Community. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">All Americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when our food and fiber are produced by hundreds of thousands of family farmers r ceiving fair prices for their products. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">The abundance of our nation's food and fiber system should not be taken for granted. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">The revolution that lifted America to the forefront of world agriculture was achieved through a unique partnership of public and private interests. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">The inattention and hostility that has characterized Republican food, agricultural and rural development policies of the past twelve years have caused a crisis in rural America. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">The cost of Republican farm policy has been staggering and its total failure is demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">A sufficient and sustainable agricultural economy can be achieved through fiscally responsible programs. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is time to reestablish the private/public partnership to ensure that family farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment, so that consumers receive safe and nutritious foods, </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">and that needed investments are made in basic research, education, rural business development, market development and infrastructure to sustain rural communities. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">Workers' Rights. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">Our workplaces must be revolutionized to make them more flexible and productive. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We will reform the job safety laws to empower workers with greater rights and to hold employers accountable for dangers on the job. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We will act against sexual ha assment in the workplace. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,254,0)">We will honor the work ethic -- by expanding the earned income tax credit so no one with children at home who works full-time is still in poverty; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">by fighting on the side of family farmers to ensure they get a fair price for their hard work; by working to sustain rural communities; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">by making work more valuable than welfare; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">and by supporting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively without fear of intimidation or permanent replacement during labor disputes. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">Lifelong Learning. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">A competitive American economy requires the global market's best educated, best trained, most flexible workforce. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">It's not enough to spend more on our schools; we must insist on results. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We oppose the Bush Administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system - the bedrock of democracy - through private school vouchers. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">To help children reach school ready to learn, we will expand child health and nutrition programs and extend Head Start to all eligible children, and guarantee all children access to quality, affordable child care. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We deplore the savage inequalities among public schools across the land, and believe every child deserves an equal chance to a world class education. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We support education reforms such as site-based decision-making and public school choice, with strong protections against discrimination. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,123,0)">We support the goal of a 90 percent graduation rate, and programs to end dropouts. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">In areas where there are no registered apprenticeship programs, we will adopt a national apprenticeship-style program to ease the transition from school to work for non-college bound students so they can acquire skills that lead to high-wage jobs. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">In the new economy, opportunity will depend on lifelong learning. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We will support the goal of literacy for all Americans. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">We will ask firms to invest in the training of all workers, not just corporate management. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">A Domestic GI Bill. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">Over the past twelve years skyrocketing costs and declining middle class incomes have placed higher education out of reach for millions of Americans. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">It is time to revolutionize the way student loan programs are run. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">We will make college affordable to all students who are qualified to attend, regardless of family income. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,2,0)">A Domestic G.I Bill will enable all Americans to borrow money for college, so long as they are willing to pay it back as a percentage of their income over time or through national service addressing u met community needs. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,250,0)">Affordable Health Care. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care -- not as a privilege, but as a right. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">That requires tough controls on health costs, which are rising at two to three times the rate of inflation, terrorizing American families and businesses and depriving millions of the care they need. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">We will enact a uniquely American reform of the health care system to control costs and make health care affordable; ensure quality and choice of health care providers; cover all Americans regardless of preexisting conditions; squeeze out waste, bureaucracy and abuse; </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(254,254,0)">improve primary and preventive care including child immunization and prevention of diseases like Tuberculosis now becoming rampant in our cities; </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,254)">While government should promise every American the opportunity to get ahead, it was the people's responsibility, he said, to make the most of that opportunity: "Faith in America demands that we recognize the new terms of the old social contract. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(254,0,0)">During the 1980s, more than 200,000 Americans were murdered, four times the number who died in Vietnam. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">Violent crimes rose by more than 16 percent since 1988 and nearly doubled since 1975. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(255,0,0)">None suffer more than the poor: an explosive mixture of blighted prospects, drugs and exotic weaponry has turned many of our inner city communities into combat zones. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,0,254)">Pursuing All Crime Aggressively. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,0,254)">In contrast to the Republican policy of leniency toward white collar crime -- which breeds cynicism in poor communities about the impartiality of our justice system -- Democrats will redouble efforts to ferret out and punish those who betray the public trust, rig financial markets, misuse their depositors' money or swindle their customers. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,0,254)">Further Initiatives. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,252,2)">IV.PRESERVING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">During the past four years, we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">Under President Bush, crises have been managed, rather than prevented; dictators like Saddam Hussein have been wooed, rather than deterred; aggression by the Serbian regime against its neighbors in what was Yugoslavia has been met by American timidity r ther than toughness; human rights abusers have been rewarded, not challenged; the environment has been neglected, not protected; and America's competitive edge in the global economy has been dulled, not honed. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">It is time for new American leadership that can meet the challenges of a changing world. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">At the end of World War II, American strength had defeated tyranny and American ingenuity had overcome the Depression. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Under President Truman, the United States led the world into a new era, redefining global security with bold approaches to tough challenges: containing communism with the NATO alliance and in Korea; building the peace through organizations such as the United Nations; and advancing global economic security through new multilateral institutions. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Nearly a half century later, we stand at another pivotal point in history. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">The collapse of communism does not mean the end of danger or threats to our interests. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Military Strength. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">America is the world's strongest military power and we must remain so. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">A post-Cold War restructuring of American forces will produce substantial savings beyond those promised by the Bush Administration, but that restructuring must be achieved without undermining our ability to meet future threats to our security. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">A military structure for the 1990's and beyond must be built on four pillars: First, a survivable nuclear force to deter any conceivable threat, as we reduce our nuclear arsenals through arms control negotiations and other reciprocal action. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Second, conventional forces shifted toward projecting power wherever our vital national interests are threatened. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">This means reducing the size of our forces in Europe, while meeting our obligations to NATO, </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">and strengthening our rapid deployment capabilities to deal with new threats to our security posed by renegade dictators, terrorists, international drug traffickers, and the local armed conflicts that can threaten the peace of entire regions. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Third, maintenance of the two qualities that make America's military the best in the world -- the superiority of our military personnel and of our technology. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">These qualities are vital to shortening any conflict and saving American lives. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Fourth, intelligence capabilities redirected to develop far more sophisticated, timely and accurate analyses of the economic and political conditions that can fuel new conflicts. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Use Of Force. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">To halt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead a renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear and chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate international restraints. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">A Comprehensive Test Ban would strengthen our ability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be our greatest future security threat. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">The strength of nations, once defined in military terms, now is measured also by the skills of their workers, the imagination of their managers and the power of their technologies. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Either we develop and pursue a national plan for restoring our economy through a partnership of government, labor and business, or we slip behind the nations that are competing with us and growing. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Economic strength -- indeed our national security -- is grounded on a healthy domestic economy. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">But we cannot be strong at home unless we are part of a vibrant and expanding global economy that recognizes human rights and seeks to improve the living standards of all the world's people. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">But as the tide of democracy rose in the former Soviet Union and in China, in the Baltics and South Africa, only reluctantly did this Administration abandon the status quo and embrace the fight for freedom. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">Unlike the Bush Administration, which waited too long to recognize the new democratic governments in the Baltic countries and the nations of the former Soviet Union, we must act decisively with our European allies to support freedom, diminish ethnic tensions, and oppose aggression in the former communist countries, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are struggling to make the transition from communism to democracy. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,0)">As change sweeps through the Balkans, the United States must be sensitive to the concerns of Greece regarding the use of the name Macedonia. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">South Africa. </span>
<span style="background-color: rgb(0,254,0)">Maintenance of state and local sanctions against South Africa in support of an investment code of conduct, existing limits on deductibility of taxes paid to South Africa, and diplomatic pressure until there is an irreversible, full and fair accommodation with the black majority to create a democratic government with full rights for all its citizens. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,0,254)">Human Rights. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,0,254)">This is a proud tradition of the Democratic Party, which has stood for freedom in South Africa and continues to resist oppression in Cuba. </span>

<span style="background-color: rgb(0,255,255)">As governments around the world have sought the path to concerted action, the Bush Administration -- despite its alleged foreign policy expertise -- has been more of an obstacle to progress than a leader for change, practicing isolationism on an issue that affects us all. </span>
