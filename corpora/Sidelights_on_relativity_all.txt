sidelight relativity ether theory relativity address delivered may university leyden doe come idea ponderable is derived abstraction everyday physicist set idea existence kind 
explanation is probably be sought phenomenon have given rise theory action property light have led undulatory 
let devote little while consideration 
outside physic know nothing action 
try connect cause effect experience natural object afford seems first were other mutual action immediate 
communication motion push heating inducing combustion mean 
is true even everyday experience is sense action play very important 
daily experience weight body meet something something not linked cause is variable time do not everyday life speculate cause therefore do not become conscious character action 
wa theory gravitation first assigned cause gravity interpreting action proceeding 
theory is probably greatest stride ever made effort causal nexus natural 
yet theory evoked lively sense discomfort seemed be conflict principle springing rest be reciprocal action only not immediate action 
is only reluctance desire knowledge endures dualism 
wa unity be preserved comprehension force 
trying look contact force being distant force admittedly are observable only very small wa road were entirely spell mostly preferred assuming newtonian action distance is only immediate action truth is conveyed medium permeating movement elastic deformation 
thus endeavour unified view nature force lead hypothesis 
be did not at first bring advance theory gravitation physic became customary treat law force axiom not further 
ether hypothesis wa bound always play part physical even first only latent 
first half nineteenth century similarity wa revealed subsists property light elastic wave ponderable ether hypothesis found fresh 
appeared question light be interpreted vibratory process inert medium filling universal 
also seemed be necessary consequence fact light is capable polarisation be nature solid transverse wave are not possible only 
thus physicist were bound arrive theory luminiferous part carry movement relatively small movement deformation correspond 
called theory stationary luminiferous found strong support experiment is also fundamental importance special theory experiment wa obliged infer luminiferous ether doe not take part movement 
phenomenon aberration also favoured theory 
development theory electricity path opened maxwell lorentz gave development idea concerning ether peculiar unexpected 
maxwell ether indeed still had property were purely much more complicated kind mechanical property tangible solid 
maxwell follower succeeded elaborating mechanical model ether furnish satisfactory mechanical interpretation law 
law were clear mechanical interpretation clumsy 
almost imperceptibly theoretical physicist adapted situation standpoint mechanical wa very 
were particularly influenced investigation heinrich 
previously had required conclusive theory content fundamental concept belong exclusively mechanic 
gradually accustomed admitting electric magnetic force fundamental concept side side requiring mechanical interpretation 
thus purely mechanical view nature wa gradually 
change led fundamental dualism wa 
way escape wa now sought reverse reducing principle mechanic especially confidence strict validity equation mechanic wa shaken experiment rapid 
dualism still confronts form theory matter appears not only bearer kinetic mechanical also bearer electromagnetic 
such field also occur 
free ether also appears bearer electromagnetic 
ether appears indistinguishable function ordinary 
matter take part motion matter empty space ha everywhere ether ha definitely assigned velocity whole 
is fundamental difference ether ponderable matter part subsists 
hertz theory suffered not only defect ascribing matter hand mechanical other hand electrical do not stand conceivable relation wa also variance result important experiment velocity propagation light moving other established experimental 
such wa state thing lorentz entered 
brought theory harmony experience mean wonderful simplification theoretical 
achieved most important advance theory electricity taking ether matter electromagnetic 
empty so too interior material not matter viewed wa exclusively seat electromagnetic 
according lorentz elementary particle matter alone are capable carrying electromagnetic activity is entirely confined carrying electric 
thus lorentz succeeded reducing electromagnetic happening equation free 
mechanical nature lorentzian be said somewhat playful immobility is only mechanical property ha not been deprived 
be added whole change conception ether special theory relativity brought consisted taking away ether last mechanical 
is be understood forthwith be 
theory kinematics special theory relativity were modelled theory electromagnetic 
theory therefore satisfies condition special theory viewed latter acquires novel 
k be system relatively lorentzian ether is equation are valid primarily reference special theory relativity same equation change meaning also hold relation new system is moving uniform translation relatively now come anxious theory distinguish k system are physically equivalent assuming ether is rest relatively k 
theoretician asymmetry theoretical corresponding asymmetry system is 
assume ether be rest relatively motion relatively physical equivalence k seems logical not indeed downright nevertheless 
next position wa possible take face state thing appeared be 
ether doe not exist at 
electromagnetic field are not state are not bound are independent reality are not reducible anything exactly atom ponderable 
conception suggests more readily according electromagnetic ponderable brings impulse energy according special theory matter radiation are special form distributed ponderable mass losing isolation appearing special form 
more careful reflection teach special theory relativity doe not compel deny 
assume existence only give ascribing definite state motion 
abstraction take last mechanical characteristic lorentz had still left 
see later point conceivability once endeavour make more intelligible somewhat halting is justified result general theory 
think wave surface 
here describe entirely different 
observe undulatory surface forming boundary water air alters course help small observe position separate particle water alters course 
existence such float tracking motion particle fluid were fundamental impossibility nothing else were observable shape space occupied water varies have ground assumption water consists movable 
same characterise 
have something electromagnetic 
picture field consisting line 
wish interpret line force something material ordinary are tempted interpret dynamic process motion line such separate line force is tracked course 
is well way regarding electromagnetic field lead 
generalising say be supposed be extended physical object idea motion be 
not be thought consisting particle allow be separately tracked 
idiom is expressed extended conformation world be regarded composed 
special theory relativity forbids assume ether consist particle observable hypothesis ether is not conflict special theory 
only be guard ascribing state motion 
standpoint special theory ether hypothesis appears first be empty 
equation electromagnetic field there addition density electric intensity 
career electromagnetic process appears be completely determined uninfluenced other physical 
electromagnetic field appear irreducible first seems superfluous postulate isotropic envisage electromagnetic field state 
other hand is weighty argument be adduced favour ether 
deny ether is ultimately assume empty space ha physical quality 
fundamental fact mechanic do not harmonize 
mechanical behaviour corporeal system hovering freely empty space depends not only relative position relative also state physically be taken characteristic not appertaining system 
order be able look rotation least something newton 
class absolute space together real rotation relative absolute space is also something 
newton no le well have called absolute space is essential is merely observable is not be looked enable acceleration rotation be looked something 
is true mach tried avoid having accept real something is not observable endeavouring substitute mechanic mean acceleration reference totality mass universe place acceleration reference absolute 
inertial resistance opposed relative acceleration distant mass presupposes action modern physicist doe not believe accept action come back once follows ha serve medium effect 
conception ether are led way thinking differs essentially ether conceived 
ether not only behaviour inert also state 
idea find full development ether general theory 
according theory metrical quality continuum differ environment different point are partly conditioned matter existing territory 
variability reciprocal relation standard space recognition fact physical relation is homogeneous compelling describe state function gravitation potential finally disposed view space is physically 
therewith conception ether ha again acquired intelligible content differs widely ether mechanical undulatory theory 
ether general theory relativity is medium is devoid mechanical kinematical help determine mechanical 
is fundamentally new ether general theory relativity opposed ether lorentz consists state former is place determined connection matter state ether neighbouring are amenable law form differential state lorentzian ether absence electromagnetic field is conditioned nothing is everywhere 
ether general theory relativity is transmuted conceptually ether lorentz substitute constant function space describe disregarding cause condition 
thus also ether general theory relativity is outcome lorentzian 
part new ether is play physic future are not yet 
know determines metrical relation 
configurative possibility solid body a well gravitational do not know ha essential share structure electrical elementary particle constituting 
do know is only proximity ponderable mass structure differs essentially lorentzian geometry space cosmic extent is approximately 
assert reason relativistic equation gravitation be departure euclidean space cosmic order exists positive mean no matter matter 
case universe necessity be spatially unbounded finite magnitude being determined value mean 
consider gravitational field electromagnetic field ether find remarkable difference 
be space part space gravitational confer space metrical be imagined 
existence gravitational field is inseparably bound existence 
other hand part space very well be imagined electromagnetic thus contrast gravitational electromagnetic field seems be only secondarily linked formal nature electromagnetic field being a yet way determined gravitational 
present state theory look electromagnetic opposed gravitational rest entirely new formal nature just a well have endowed gravitational ether field field scalar instead field electromagnetic 
according present conception elementary particle matter are nothing else condensation electromagnetic present view universe present reality are completely separated other connected gravitational ether electromagnetic also be 
of course be great advance succeed comprehending gravitational field electromagnetic field together unified 
then first time epoch theoretical physic founded faraday maxwell reach satisfactory 
contrast ether matter fade general theory whole physic become complete system theory 
exceedingly ingenious attempt direction ha been made mathematician do not believe theory hold ground relation 
contemplating immediate future theoretical physic not unconditionally reject possibility fact comprised quantum theory set bound field theory 
say according general theory relativity space is endowed physical exists 
according general theory relativity space ether is such space not only be propagation also possibility existence standard space time therefore interval physical 
ether not be thought endowed quality characteristic ponderable consisting part be tracked 
idea motion not be applied 
geometry experience expanded form address prussian academy science berlin january 
reason mathematics enjoys special other is law are absolutely certain other science are extent debatable constant danger being overthrown newly discovered 
spite investigator department science not need envy mathematician law mathematics referred object mere not object 
occasion surprise different person arrive same logical conclusion have already agreed fundamental law a well method other law are be deduced 
is reason high repute is mathematics affords exact natural science certain measure mathematics not 
point enigma present age ha agitated inquiring 
be being after all product human thought is independent is so admirably appropriate object 
is human merely taking able fathom property real 
opinion answer question far law mathematics refer are not a far are do not refer 
seems complete clearness state thing first became common property new departure mathematics is known name mathematical logic 
progress achieved axiomatics consists having neatly separated objective intuitive according axiomatics alone form is not concerned intuitive other content associated 
let moment consider point view axiom point space there always pass only straight 
is axiom be interpreted older sense more modern 
older one know straight line point 
knowledge spring ability human mind collaboration other is not mathematician 
leaf question 
being based precedes axiom stated above other is expression part 
more modern treat entity are denoted word straight 
entity do not take granted knowledge intuition presuppose only validity such one stated are be taken purely formal 
void content intuition 
axiom are free creation human 
other proposition geometry are logical inference axiom are be taken nominalistic sense 
matter geometry treat is first defined 
schlick book epistemology ha therefore characterised axiom very aptly 
view advocated modern purge mathematics extraneous thus dispels mystic obscurity formerly surrounded principle 
presentation principle thus clarified make also evident mathematics such predicate anything perceptual object real 
axiomatic geometry word stand only empty conceptual 
give substance is not relevant 
other hand is certain mathematics particularly owes existence need wa felt learning something relation real thing 
very word mean prof 
ha do possibility disposition certain natural object respect part 
is clear system concept axiomatic geometry alone make assertion relation real object call 
be able make such geometry be stripped merely character real object experience empty conceptual axiomatic 
accomplish need only add body are respect possible are body euclidean geometry 
then proposition euclid contain affirmation relation 
geometry thus completed is evidently natural fact regard most ancient branch 
affirmation rest essentially induction not logical inference 
call completed geometry distinguish follows axiomatic 
question practical geometry universe is euclidean not ha clear answer only be furnished 
linear measurement physic is practical geometry so too is geodetic astronomical linear call help law experience light is propagated straight indeed straight line sense practical 
attach special importance view geometry have just set have been unable formulate theory 
following reflection have been system reference rotating relatively inert law disposition rigid body do not correspond rule euclidean geometry account lorentz thus admit system abandon euclidean 
decisive step transition general equation certainly not have been taken above interpretation had not served 
deny relation body axiomatic euclidean geometry body readily arrive following wa entertained acute profound geometry is distinguished other imaginable axiomatic geometry 
now axiomatic geometry contains assertion reality be do so only combination physical be possible be nature retain euclidean 
contradiction theory experience manifest rather decide change physical law change axiomatic euclidean 
deny relation body indeed not easily free convention euclidean geometry is be retained 
is equivalence body body suggests so poincare other 
simply closer inspection real solid body nature are not geometrical possibility relative depend external 
thus immediate relation geometry physical reality appears feel impelled following more general characterizes 
geometry predicate nothing relation real only geometry together purport physical law do 
using say only sum is subject control 
thus be chosen also part law are 
is necessary avoid contradiction is choose remainder whole are together accord 
envisaged axiomatic geometry part natural law ha been given conventional status appear epistemologically 
specie is 
idea idea clock theory relativity do not find exact correspondence real 
is also clear solid body clock do not conceptual edifice physic play part irreducible composite not play independent part theoretical 
is conviction present stage development theoretical physic idea still be employed independent are still far possessing such certain knowledge theoretical principle be able give exact theoretical construction solid body 
objection are really rigid body therefore property predicated rigid body do not apply physical objection is mean so radical appear hasty 
is not difficult task determine physical state so accurately behaviour relatively other be sufficiently free ambiguity allow be substituted 
is kind statement rigid body be 
practical geometry is based principle is accessible now try 
call is enclosed marked 
imagine tract marked 
tract are said be boundary tract be brought coincide permanently boundary 
now assume tract are found be equal once are equal always 
not only practical geometry also nearest practical geometry therewith general theory rest 
experimental reason warrant assumption mention only 
phenomenon propagation light empty space assigns appropriate path interval local 
thence follows above assumption tract also hold good interval theory 
consequently be formulated ideal clock are going same rate time place then immediate proximity always go same no matter are again compared other law were not valid real proper frequency separate atom same chemical element not be such exact agreement experience 
existence sharp spectral line is convincing experimental proof principle practical 
is ultimate foundation fact enables speak meaning sense continuum 
question structure continuum is accordance general according view is here being properly speaking physical question be answered not question mere convention be selected practical 
geometry be right thing law disposition body are transformable body geometry exactitude increase proportion dimension part consideration are 
is true proposed physical interpretation geometry break applied immediately space order 
even question constitution elementary retains part 
even is question describing electrical elementary particle constituting attempt still be made ascribe physical importance idea field have been physically defined purpose describing geometrical behaviour body are large compared 
success alone decide justification postulate physical reality fundamental principle geometry domain physical 
possibly turn extrapolation ha better warrant extrapolation idea temperature part body molecular order 
appears le problematical extend idea practical geometry space cosmic order 
be objected construction composed solid rod departs more more ideal rigidity proportion spatial extent becomes 
hardly be assign fundamental significance 
therefore question universe is spatially finite not seems decidedly pregnant question sense practical 
do not even consider impossible question be answered long 
let call mind general theory relativity teach 
offer 
universe is spatially 
be so only average spatial density matter universal concentrated 
ratio total mass star magnitude space are scattered approximates indefinitely value space taken consideration are constantly greater 
universe is spatially 
be is mean density ponderable matter universal space differing 
smaller mean greater is volume universal 
not fail mention theoretical argument be adduced favour hypothesis finite 
general theory relativity teach inertia given body is greater are more ponderable mass proximity thus seems very natural reduce total effect inertia body action reaction other body ever gravity ha been completely reduced action reaction 
equation general theory relativity be deduced total reduction inertia reciprocal action required possible only universe is spatially 
many physicist astronomer argument make 
experience alone finally decide possibility is realised 
experience furnish 
first seem possible determine mean density matter observation part universe is accessible 
hope is 
distribution visible star is extremely account venture set mean density universe let mean density milky 
great space examined not feel convinced were more star 
so seems impossible estimate mean 
is seems more also present great 
inquire deviation shown consequence general theory relativity are accessible are compared consequence newtonian first find deviation show close proximity gravitating ha been confirmed case planet 
universe is spatially finite is second deviation newtonian language newtonian be expressed gravitational field is nature such were not only ponderable also negative distributed uniformly 
factitious have be enormously make presence felt only gravitating system very great 
assuming let statistical distribution star milky a well then law calculate gravitational field mean velocity star milky way not collapse mutual attraction maintain actual 
now actual velocity be were smaller calculated have proof actual attraction great distance are smaller 
deviation be proved indirectly universe is 
even be possible estimate spatial 
picture universe is yet 
usual answer question is is not right 
purpose following remark is show answer be 
want show extraordinary difficulty illustrate theory finite universe mean mental image soon grow 
first observation epistemological 
theory such is incapable being directly being merely system 
concept serve purpose bringing multiplicity real imaginary sensory experience connection 
bring home therefore mean give representation abundance experience theory supply schematic 
present case have ask represent relation solid body respect reciprocal disposition corresponds theory finite 
is really nothing new have say innumerable question addressed prove requirement thirst knowledge matter have not yet been completely 
initiated pardon part bring forward ha long been 
do wish express say space is 
nothing more lay number body equal size side side ever filling 
suppose are provided great many wooden cube same 
accordance euclidean geometry place fill part space construction never be go adding more more cube ever finding wa more 
is wish express say space is 
be better say space is infinite relation assuming law disposition body are given euclidean 
example infinite continuum is 
plane surface lay square cardboard side square ha side square adjacent 
construction is never always go laying law disposition correspond plane figure euclidean 
plane is therefore infinite relation cardboard 
accordingly say plane is infinite continuum space infinite continuum 
is here meant number think assume be 
now take example continuum is 
imagine surface large globe quantity small paper same 
place disc anywhere surface 
move disc anywhere surface do not come limit boundary anywhere 
therefore say spherical surface globe is unbounded 
spherical surface is finite 
stick paper disc disc overlap surface globe finally become so full is room 
simply mean spherical surface globe is finite relation paper 
spherical surface is continuum is law disposition rigid figure lying do not agree euclidean 
be shown following 
place paper disc spherical circle place more is be surrounded turn so 
construction is made plane have uninterrupted disposition are disc touching disc lie 
disc maximally packed spherical surface construction also seems promise success smaller radius disc proportion more promising 
construction progress becomes more more patent disposition disc manner is not be possible euclidean geometry plane 
way creature leave spherical even peep spherical surface merely experimenting is not spherical 
latest result theory relativity is probable space is also approximately law disposition rigid body are not given euclidean approximately spherical only consider part space are sufficiently 
is place imagination 
imagine cry 
be be 
represent spherical surface well nothing analogous 
circle projected sphere try surmount barrier patient reader see is mean particularly difficult 
purpose first give attention once more geometry spherical 
adjoining figure let be spherical touched facility is shown drawing bounded 
let be disc spherical 
let imagine point spherical diametrically opposite is luminous throwing shadow disc plane 
point sphere ha shadow 
disc sphere is shadow plane also 
disc is almost exactly coincides 
move spherical surface away disc shadow plane also move away plane growing bigger 
disc approach luminous point shadow move becomes infinitely 
now put are law disposition plane 
evidently are exactly same law disposition disc spherical 
original figure is corresponding shadow figure 
disc are shadow also 
plane agrees 
call rigid then spherical geometry hold good plane respect rigid 
plane is finite respect only finite number shadow find room 
point somebody is 
are rigid 
have only move rule about plane convince shadow constantly increase size move away plane 
rule were behave plane same way 
then be impossible show shadow increase size move away assertion then no longer have meaning 
fact only objective assertion be made is just are related exactly same way are rigid disc spherical surface sense euclidean 
carefully bear mind statement growth move away ha objective a long are unable employ euclidean rigid body be moved about plane purpose comparing size 
respect law disposition shadow point ha special privilege plane more spherical 
representation given spherical geometry plane is important readily allows be transferred 
let imagine point great number small be brought coincide 
sphere are not be rigid sense euclidean radius is increase sense euclidean are moved away increase is take place exact accordance same law applies increase radius 
having gained vivid mental image geometrical behaviour let assume space are rigid body at all sense euclidean only body having behaviour 
then have vivid representation spherical rather spherical 
here sphere be called 
increase size depart is not be detected measuring more case standard measurement behave same way 
space is is same spherical configuration are possible environment 
space is consequence only finite number find room 
is intelligible only revert once more case disc surface 
using practice thinking visualisation euclidean geometry give have acquired mental picture spherical 
difficulty impart more depth vigour idea carrying special imaginary 
be difficult represent case is called elliptical geometry analogous 
only aim ha been show human faculty visualisation is mean bound capitulate
