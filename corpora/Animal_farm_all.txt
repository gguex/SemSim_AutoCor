much thought snowball declared seven commandment effect be reduced single maxim leg good leg 
this said contained essential principle animalism 
had thoroughly grasped be safe human influence 
bird first objected seemed also had leg snowball proved wa not so

spring summer worked sixty hour week august napoleon announced be work sunday afternoon well 
work wa strictly voluntary animal absented have ration reduced half 
even so wa found necessary leave certain task undone 
harvest wa little le successful previous year field have been sown root early summer were not sown ploughing had not been completed early enough 
wa possible foresee coming winter be hard one 
windmill presented unexpected difficulty 
wa good quarry limestone farm plenty sand cement had been found outhouse material building were hand 
problem animal not first solve wa break stone piece suitable size 
seemed way doing pick crowbar animal use animal stand hind leg 
only week vain effort did right idea occur somebody namely utilise force gravity 
huge boulder far too big be used were were lying all bed quarry 
animal lashed rope then all together cow horse animal lay hold rope  even pig sometimes joined critical moments  they dragged desperate slowness slope top quarry were toppled edge shatter piece 
transporting stone wa once broken wa comparatively simple 
horse carried cart loads sheep dragged single block even muriel benjamin yoked old governess cart did share 
late summer sufficient store stone had accumulated then building began superintendence pig 
wa slow laborious process 
frequently took whole day exhausting effort drag single boulder top quarry sometimes wa pushed edge failed break 
nothing have been achieved boxer strength seemed equal rest animal put together 
boulder began slip animal cried despair finding dragged hill wa always boxer strained rope brought boulder stop 
see toiling slope inch breath coming fast tip hoof clawing ground great side matted sweat filled everyone admiration 
clover warned sometimes be careful not overstrain boxer never listen her 
slogan work harder napoleon is always right seemed sufficient answer problem 
had made arrangement cockerel call three quarters hour earlier morning instead hour 
spare moment were not many nowadays go alone quarry collect load broken stone drag site windmill unassisted 
animal were not badly off summer spite hardness work 
had more food had had jones day least did not have le 
advantage only having feed not having support extravagant human being a well wa so great have taken lot failure outweigh 
many way animal method doing thing wa more efficient saved labour 
such job weeding instance be done thoroughness impossible human being 
again animal now stole wa unnecessary fence pasture arable land saved lot labour upkeep hedge gate 
nevertheless summer wore various unforeseen shortage began make self felt 
wa need paraffin oil nail string dog biscuit iron horse shoe none be produced farm 
later also be need seed artificial manure various tool finally machinery windmill 
were be procured one wa able imagine 
sunday morning animal assembled receive order napoleon announced had decided new policy

monday mr whymper visited farm had been arranged 
wa sly looking little man side whisker solicitor very small way business sharp enough have realised earlier anyone else animal farm need broker commission be worth having 
animal watched coming going kind dread avoided a much possible 
nevertheless sight napoleon four delivering order whymper stood leg roused pride partly reconciled new arrangement 
relation human race were now not quite same had been 
human being did not hate animal farm le now wa prospering indeed hated more 
human being held article faith farm go bankrupt sooner later all windmill be failure

animal were hard work building yet windmill one wa finished so wa said dynamo be installed 
luxury snowball had once taught animal dream stall electric light hot cold water three day week were no longer talked 
napoleon had denounced such idea contrary spirit animalism 
truest happiness said lay working hard living frugally 
somehow seemed farm had grown richer making animal richer except course pig dog 
perhaps wa partly were so many pig so many dog 
wa not creature did not work fashion 
wa squealer wa never tired explaining endless work supervision organisation farm 
much work wa kind other animal were too ignorant understand 
example squealer told pig had expend enormous labour day mysterious thing called memoranda
