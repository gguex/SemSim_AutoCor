1,6,TOP-LEVEL SEGMENTthe hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle which adds to the picturesqueness of the view but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to our date there are however many finely preserved remains of hellenistic roman and byzantine architecture the most remarkable being the temple of augustus and rome 20 bc which is also known as the monumentum ancyranum
1,7,historythe regions vibrant history can be traced back to the bronze age hatti civilization which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium bc by the hittites in the 10th century bc by the phrygians and later by the lydians persians macedonians galatians romans byzantines and turks seljuk empire then ottoman empire and then turkey
1,8,historythe oldest settlements in and around the city center of ankara belong to the hatti civilization which lived during the bronze age artifacts discovered in the city have revealed that the hittites called ankara with the name ankuwash prior to 1200 bc the city significantly grew in size and importance under the phrygians starting from around 1000 bc experiencing a large expansion following the mass migration from gordion the capital of phrygia after an earthquake which severely damaged that city in antiquity in phrygian tradition king midas was venerated as the founder of ancyra but pausanias mentions that the city was actually far older in line with the presentday knowledge that we have on its history
1,9,historyphrygian rule was succeeded first by lydian and later by persian rule though the strongly phrygian character of the peasantry remained as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later roman period persian sovereignty lasted until the persians defeat at the hands of the macedonian king alexander the great who conquered the city in 333 bc alexander came from gordion to ankara and stayed in the city for a short period after his death at babylon in 323 bc and the subsequent division of his empire amongst his generals ankara and its environs fell into the share of antigonus apart from the phrygian period in which the city experienced its largest expansion in the ancient times another important expansion took place under the greeks of pontos who came there and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the black sea ports and crimea to the north assyria cyprus and lebanon to the south and georgia armenia and persia to the east by that time the city also took its name áγκυρα ànkyra meaning anchor in greek which is still used by the turks with the slightly modified form of ankara
1,10,historyin 278 bc the city along with the rest of central anatolia was occupied by the celtic race of galatians who were the first to make ankara one of their main tribal centres the headquarters of the tectosages tribe other centres were pessinos todays balhisar for the trocmi tribe and tavium to the east of ankara for the tolstibogii tribe the city was then known as ancyra the celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers a warrior aristocracy which ruled over phrygianspeaking peasants however the celtic language continued to spoken in galatia for many centuries at the end of the 4th century ad st jerome a native of galatia observed that the language spoken around ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the roman world near trier
1,11,historythe city was subsequently conquered by augustus in 25 bc and passed under the control of the roman empire now the capital city of the roman province of galatia ancyra continued to be a center of great commercial importance ankara is also famous for the monumentum ancyranum temple of augustus and rome which contains the official record of the acts of augustus known as the res gestae divi augusti an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple the ruins of ancyra still furnish today valuable basreliefs inscriptions and other architectural fragments
1,12,historyaugustus decided to make ancyra one of three main administrative centres in central anatolia the town was then populated by phrygians and celtsmdashthe galatians who spoke a language closely related to welsh and gaelic ancyra was the center of a tribe known as the tectosages and augustus upgraded it into a major provincial capital for his empire two other galatian tribal centres tavium near yozgat and pessinus balhisar to the west near sivrihisar continued to be reasonably important settlements in the roman period but it was ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis
1,13,historyan estimated 200000 people lived in ancyra in good times during the roman empire a far greater number than was to be the case after the fall of the roman empire until the early twentieth century a small river the ankara çayı ran through the centre of the roman town it has now been covered over and diverted but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the roman byzantine and ottoman periods çankaya the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center stood well outside the roman city but may have been a summer resort in the 19th century the remains of at least one roman villa or large house were still standing not far from where the çankaya presidential residence stands today to the west the roman city extended until the area of the gençlik park and railway station while on the southern side of the hill it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by hacettepe university it was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the roman towns of gaul or britannia
1,14,historyancyras importance rested on the fact was that it was the junction point where the roads in northern anatolia running northsouth and eastwest intersected the great imperial road running east passed through ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way they were not the only ones to use the roman highway network which was equally convenient for invaders in the second half of the 3rd century ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the goths coming from the west who rode far into the heart of cappadocia taking slaves and pillaging and later by the arabs for about a decade the town was one of the western outposts of one of the most brilliant queens of the ancient world the arab empress zenobia from palmyra in the syrian desert who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the roman empire to set up a shortlived state of her own
1,15,historythe town was reincorporated into the roman empire under the emperor aurelian in 272 the tetrarchy a system of multiple up to four emperors introduced by diocletian 284305 seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from ankara westwards to germe and dorylaeum now eskişehir
1,16,historyin its heyday roman ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital where a high official ruled from the citys praetorium a large administrative palace or office during the 3rd century life in ancyra as in other anatolian towns seems to have become somewhat militarised in response to the invasions and instability of the town in this period like other cities of central anatolia ankara was also undergoing christianisation
1,17,historyearly martyrs about whom little is known included proklos and hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown village of kallippi near ancyra and suffered repression under the emperor trajan 98117 in the 280s ad we hear of philumenos a christian corn merchant from southern anatolia being captured and martyred in ankara and eustathius
1,18,historylike in other roman towns the reign of diocletian marked the culmination point of repression against christians in 303 ancyra was one of the towns where the coemperors diocletian and his deputy galerius launched their antichristian persecution in ancyra their first target was the 38yearold bishop of the town whose name was clement clements life describes how he was taken to rome then sent back and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he and his brother and various companions were put to death the remains of the church of st clement can be found today in a building just off işıklar caddesi in the ulus district quite possibly this marks the site where clement was originally buried four years later a doctor of the town named plato and his brother antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under galerius theodotus of ancyra is also venerated as a saint
1,19,historyhowever the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 ancyra was the center of an important council of the early church which considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the christian church after the persecutions and in particular the treatment of lapsimdashchristians who had given in and conformed to paganism during these persecutions three councils were held in the former capital of galatia in asia minor during the 4th century the first an orthodox plenary synod was held in 314 and its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the sacrament of penance nine of them deal with conditions for the reconciliation of the lapsi the others with marriage alienations of church property etc
1,20,historythough paganism was probably tottering in ancyra in clements day it may still have been the majority religion twenty years later christianity and monotheism had taken its place ancyra quickly turned into a christian city with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes the town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead during the middle of the 4th century ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of christ and a form of arianism seems to have originated there
1,21,historythe synod of 358 was a semiarian conciliabulum presided over by basil of ancyra it condemned the grosser arian blasphemies but set forth an equally heretical doctrine in the proposition that the son was in all things similar to the father but not identical in substance
1,22,historyin 362363 the emperor julian the apostate passed through ancyra on his way to an illfated campaign against the persians and according to christian sources engaged in a persecution of various holy men the stone base for a statue with an inscription describing julian as lord of the whole world from the british ocean to the barbarian nations can still be seen built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of ankara castle the column of julian which was erected in honor of the emperors visit to the city in 362 still stands today in 375 arian bishops met at ancyra and deposed several bishops among them st gregory of nyssa the modern ankara also known in some western texts as angora remains a roman catholic titular see in the former roman province of galatia in asia minor suffragan of laodicea its episcopal list is given in gams series episc eccl cath also that of another ancyra in phrygia pacatiana
1,23,historyin the later 4th century ancyra became something of an imperial holiday resort after constantinople became the east roman capital emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the bosphorus to the drier mountain atmosphere of ancyra theodosius ii 408450 kept his court in ancyra in the summers laws issued in ancyra testify to the time they spent there the citys military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long byzantine reign although ancyra fell into the hands of several arab armies numerous times after the 6th century it remained an important crossroads polis within the byzantine empire until the late 11th century

4,6,historyalexandria was founded by alexander the great in 332 bc the exact date is disputed as aleksándreia alexanders chief architect for the project was dinocrates ancient accounts are extremely numerous and varied and much influenced by subsequent developments one of the more sober descriptions given by the historian arrian tells how alexander undertook to lay out the citys general plan but lacking chalk or other means resorted to sketching it out with grain

4,33,geographythe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known but there is little information as to their actual position none however are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of pharos island there the the great lighthouse one of the seven wonders of the world reputed to be 138nbspmeters 450nbspft high was sited the first ptolemy began the project and the second ptolemy completed it at a total cost of 800nbsp talents it took 12nbspyears to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world the light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone the pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder next to the great pyramid of giza a temple of hephaestus also stood on pharos at the head of the mole

22,23,historythe etymology of london remains unclear the earliest mention of the citys toponym can be attributed to geoffrey of monmouth in historia regum britanniae the name is described as originating from king lud in which he had allegedly taken over the city and named it after himself to kaerlud this was then eventually slurred into kaerludein and finally london although some sources support this theory geoffreys work is largely based on celtic folklore and it is believed that he was trying to balance historical writings in order to give preeminence to roman saxon and norman versions of history
22,24,historyseveral other explanations have been proposed by linguists throughout history many propose that the name comes from welsh or brythonic meaning city on the lake or fortress on the lake other theories propose the name to mean precinct of the fortress city on the hill city of the moon or city on the grove another possible explanation is that the area of london was previously settled by belgae who named their outposts after townships in belgium some of these belgic toponyms have been attributed to the namesake of london including lime douvrend and londinières a fanciful theory suggests that the anglosaxons were descendants of the tribe of dan when inhabiting in the area it is possible that they would have named their settlement landan meaning place of dan in hebrew
22,25,historyrichard coates a linguistics professor now at the university of the west of england suggested in 1998 that the name derives from the preceltic plowonida which roughly means a river too wide to ford he suggested that when a settlement was founded the inhabitants added the suffix on or onjon to toponyms protoindoeuropean p was regularly lost in protoceltic and through linguistic change the name developed from plowonidonjon to lundonjon then contracted to lundein or lundyn and finally latinised to londinium via the romans
22,26,historyalthough there is some evidence of scattered brython settlement in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans in ad 43 as londinium following the roman conquest of britain the first london lasted for just seventeen years around ad 61 the iceni tribe of celts led by queen boudica stormed london burning it to the ground the next heavilyplanned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in ad 100 at its height in the 2nd century ad roman london had a population of around 60000 however by the 3rd century ad the city started a slow decline due to trouble in the roman empire and by the 5th century ad it was largely abandoned
22,27,historyby 600 ad the anglosaxons had created a new settlement called lundenwic about 1 km upstream from the old roman city around what is now covent garden there was probably a harbour at the mouth of the river fleet for fishing and trading and this trading grew until disaster struck in 851 ad when the citys defences were overcome by a massive viking raid and it was razed to the ground a viking occupation twenty years later was shortlived and alfred the great the new king of england established peace and moved the settlement within the defensive walls of the old roman city then called lundenburgh the original city became ealdwic old city a name surviving to the present day as aldwych
22,28,historysubsequently under the control of various english kings london once again prospered as an international trading centre and political arena however viking raids began again in the late 10th century and reached a head in 1013 when they besieged the city under danish king canute and forced english king ethelred the unready to flee in a retaliatory attack ethelreds army achieved victory by pulling down london bridge with the danish garrison on top and english control was reestablished
22,29,historycanute took control of the english throne in 1017 controlling the city and country until 1042 when his death resulted in a reversion to anglosaxon control under his pious stepson edward the confessor who refounded westminster abbey and the adjacent palace of westminster by this time london had become the largest and most prosperous city in england although the official seat of government was still at winchester
22,30,historyfollowing a victory at the battle of hastings william the conqueror the then duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newlyfinished westminster abbey on christmas day 1066 william granted the citizens of london special privileges while building a castle in the southeast corner of the city to keep them under control this castle was expanded by later kings and is now known as the tower of london serving first as a royal residence and later as a prison
22,31,historyin 1097 william ii began the building of westminster hall close by the abbey of the same name the hall proved the basis of a new palace of westminster the prime royal residence throughout the middle ages westminster became the seat of the royal court and government persisting until the present day while its distinct neighbour the city of london was a centre of trade and commerce and flourished under its own unique administration the corporation of london eventually the adjacent cities grew together and formed the basis of modern central london superseding winchester as capital of england in the 12th century
22,32,historylondon grew in wealth and population during the middle ages in 1100 its population was around 18000 by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100000 however disaster struck during the black death in the mid14th century when london lost nearly a third of its population apart from the invasion of london during the peasants revolt in 1381 london remained relatively untouched by the various civil wars during the middle ages such as the first and second barons wars and the wars of the roses
22,33,historyafter the successful defeat of the spanish armada in 1588 political stability in england allowed london to grow further in 1603 james vi of scotland came to the throne of england essentially uniting the two countries his enactment of harsh anticatholic laws made him unpopular and an assassination attempt was made on 5 november 1605 the famous gunpowder plot
22,34,historyplague caused extensive problems for london in the early 17th century culminating in the great plague in 16651666 this was the last major outbreak in europe possibly thanks to the disastrous fire of 1666 the great fire of london broke out in the original city and quickly swept through londons wooden buildings destroying large swathes of the city rebuilding took over ten years
22,35,historyfollowing londons growth in the 18th century it became the worlds largest city from about 1831 to 1925 this growth was aided from 1836 by londons first railways which put countryside towns within easy reach of the city the rail network expanded very rapidly and caused these places to grow while london itself expanded into surrounding fields merging with neighbouring settlements such as kensington rising traffic congestion on city centre roads led to the creation of the worlds first metro systemthe london underground in 1863 driving further expansion and urbanisation because of this rapid growth london became one of the first cities in human history to reach a population of one million and was the first ever to surpass five million
22,36,historylondons local government system struggled to cope with the rapid growth especially in providing the city with adequate infrastructure between 1855 and 1889 the metropolitan board of works oversaw infrastructure expansion it was then replaced by the county of london overseen by the london county council londons first elected citywide administration

25,23,politicswhile the federal district was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor the municipalities were autonomous and this duality of powers created constant tensions between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century in 1903 already porfirio díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district eventually in december 1928 the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district in place of the municipalities the federal district was divided into one central department and 13 delegaciones boroughs administered directly by the government of the federal district the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city tacuba tacubaya and mixcoac

27,4,namesthe name mumbai is an eponym etymologically derived from mumba or mahaamba the name of the hindu goddess mumbadevi and aai mother in marathi the former name bombay had its origins in the 16th century when the portuguese arrived in the area and called the place with various names which would finally take on the written form bombaim still common in current portuguese use after the british gained possession in the 17th century it was anglicised to bombay although it was known as mumbai or mambai to marathi and gujaratispeakers and as bambai in hindi urdu and punjabi however even marathi and gujaratispeakers commonly used bombay when speaking in english the name was officially changed to its marathi pronunciation of mumbai in 1995
27,5,namesa widespread explanation of the origin of the traditional english name bombay holds that it would be derived from a portuguese name meaning good bay this is based on the fact that bom masc is portuguese for good whereas the english word bay is similar to the portuguese baía fem bahia in old spelling the normal portuguese rendering of good bay would have been boa bahia rather than the grammatically incorrect bom bahia however it is possible to find the form baim masc for little bay in sixteen century portuguese
27,6,namesother sources have a different origin for the portuguese toponym bombaim josé pedro machados dicionário onomástico etimológico da língua portuguesa portuguese dictionary of onomastics and etymology mentions what is probably the first portuguese reference to the place dated from 1516 as benamajambu or tenamaiambu pointing out that maiambu seems to refer to mumbadevi the hindu goddess after which the place is named in marathi mumbai in that same century the spelling seems to have evolved to mombayn 1525 and then mombaim 1563 the final form bombaim appears later in the 16th century as recorded by gaspar correia in his lendas da índia legends of india jp machado seems to reject the bom bahia hypothesis asserting that portuguese records mentioning the presence of a bay at the place led the english to assume that the noun bahia bay was an integral part of the portuguese toponym hence the english version bombay adapted from portuguese

55,2,originaccording to an ebrié legend the name abidjan formerly abijean came from a misunderstanding an old man returning from his field with an armful of branches that he probably intended to use to repair the roof of his house happened to encounter a lost european explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village unable to speak the white mans language the old man believed he had been asked what he was doing there fleeing in terror from this unexpected encounter the old man shouted tchan me bidjan which in the ebrié language means ive just been cutting branches the white man took this to be the answer to his question and conscientiously noted the name abidjan
55,3,historyabidjan was the third city to be the capital of the ivory coast after grandbassam and bingerville which is now considered to form a suburb of the current capital its populace the tchaman were renamed ébrié derived from the quolibet given to the lagoon pirates by the inhabitants of grandbassam as such in their language ébrié means saltydirty skin
55,4,historyunder the direction of engineer houidaille bingerville was created in 1899 following an epidemic of yellow fever the colonies of grandbissam decided to relocate here because of its healthy atmosphere this was also when the colonial government started its relocation to the remote village of adjamé which would come to be named bingerville after the first governor of the colonies louisgustave binger
55,5,historythe future abidjan nearby also situated by the lagune ndoupé lagoon of warm waters the future ébrié lagoon offered more space and greater possibilities for commercial expansion the petitbassam wharf the current port bouët south of the metropolitan area grew rapidly in competition with the grandbissam wharf until then the principal economic gateway for the colony in 1904 when bingerville had not yet been completed abidjan became the principal economic pillar of the ivory cost colonies a primary relay point for distribution of european goods further inland notably by an increasingly important lebanese community
55,6,historyon 10 august 1933 a decree was passed moving the capital from bingerville to abidjan or abidjean displacing many tchaman villages which moved mostly to adjame the confluence or centre for tchaman located north of the plateau and which again became the chief tchaman community it is here that the community lost the sacred drum a very characteristic drum which is currently in the possession of the musée de lhomme the museum of man as currency of blackmail to force tchaman participation in the construction of the abidjanniger railway system
55,7,historysouth of the plateau district currently the central district of the abidjan metropolitan area the village of dugbeyo was moved to the other side of the lagoon in anoumabo the forest of the dogfish which would later become the district of treichville in 1934 renamed in honour of marcel treichlaplène 18601890 the first explorer of ivory coast and its first colonial administrator considered its founder where dugbeyo once stood today the avenue treichlaplène serves as the main bus and ferry terminal and is also the location of avenue charles de gaulle commonly called commercial street
55,8,historythe city is designed along the usual colonial guidelines on the basis of rather utopian townplanning the colonists inhabit the plateau mbrato in the tchaman language while the colonized people live in the north the two zones were separated by the gallieni military barracks where the current law courts are located
55,9,historyin 1931 the plateau and treichville which became commikro the city of clerks were roughly connected by a floating bridge at the place du pont houphouët boigny in this year the first of the street addresses of abidjan were set up these remained in place until in 1964 at the whim of mayor conan kanga they were badly supplemented with the american system in 1993
55,10,historyin years 1940 and 1950 like cairo tangier and istanbul abidjan became a part of popular imagination as a nest for spies and hooligans
55,11,historyin 1951 the colonial authorities decided to build the vidri canal from the sea to the lagoon so that ships could access the port at abidjan causing a drop in temperature of the hot waters of the lagoon ndoucé abidjan now entered a long phase of splendour which would last until thes 1980 s
55,12,historyafter independence in 1960 the old colonial cities became administrative and business centres as well as the presidential seat the southern areas of treichville towards the international airport and the beaches became the district for europeans and the middle class abidjanian it is here that the antifrench riots of november 2004 would be concentrated the cocody district famous for the movie le gentleman de cocody embodied in cinema by jean marais and which as per the colonial urban plan was to be a vast indigenous district became a smart district which contained the presidential residence the french embassy the ivory hotel and since 2006 the largest us embassy in africa large working class zones developed between these poles extended by precarious living conditions feeding off the misery caused by rural migration and exploitation of subregional migration
55,13,historythanks to negligent civil servants and corruption in spite of undeniable modernization since 1980 one witnesses a general degradation of abidjan and an amplification of its pollution in 2006 the massive poisoning of the population by polluting products poured in the refuse tips are an illustration and an inevitable drama

55,16,historyabidjan did not exist before the start of the 20th century
55,17,historyin 1950 it had just exceeded a population threshold of 50000 at the end of 1948 to reach a population of a million by the end of the year 1975 a growth rate of 10 to 12 per annum would be required corresponding to a doubling every 6 or 7 years but this curve underwent a sharp inflection due to the crisis of the 80s one can suppose that in the last 20 years of the 20th century the growth rate will have evolved by 3 to 6 the natural growth rate was supplemented by migratory contribution as well with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals positive migration prior to the census of 1988 contributed a growth of about 80000 with 50000 people from within ivory coast and about 30000 from abroad from within ivory coast the migration pattern was dominated by akan southeast 48 then mande northwest 24 and krou southwest 20 from abroad the migration was burkinabes 30 malians 22 ghanaians 19 natives of niger 11 of the guineans 9 it should be noted that of the nonafrican migration lebanese migration exceeded that of europeans with the french being most in number of these all in all nonafrican migration represents hardly 3 of the total population of abidjan which is still a record for the area
55,18,populationthe figures as of 2006 estimate the abidjanaise population at 3796677 in 2006 the metropolitan area of abidjan had 5060858 inhabitants this increase in the population can be attributed to the displacement caused by the war since september 2002 this city has many inhabitants who come to live downtown because they seek employment and safer lodgings

55,20,geography and neighbourhoodsthe urban distribution appears disorganized indeed abidjan an immense city home to approximately 2500000 people has seen its population doubling every seven years since 1945 where does such growth come from from the future opportunities it represents for the rural people and so this city which accounts for 45 of the habitants of ivory coast and contributes to 20 of the countrys population endures a population invasion from rural peasant folk hoping for a better life however if a major rise has been noticed for nearly half a century the fact remains that now this growth does not come closer than 45 per annum compared to 10 from 1960 to 1990 with only about 13 contribution of rural migration 23 from 1960 to 1990 however in spite of this fall the city is still gigantic compared to the second most important city of the country bouaké 1500000 inhabitants or even to the capital yamoussoukro 100000 inhabitants

55,39,illegal dumping in abidjanin recent times several factors have contributed to global climatic dangers global warming in the depletion of the ozone layer have been caused by hazardous human activities distraction of age old ecosystem as well as ones possible toxic waste disposal practices among other factors have collectively contributed to the environmental degradation with grave consequences to the inhabitants of this planet last year some toxic waste from europe was illegally dumped in the african city of abidjan in ivory coast causing death and suffering to the residents this raised global concern over the toxic waste disposal practices this section discusses the matter looking at the possible solution that could ensure that this does not happen again in the future it is indeed possible to curb the degradation however this is going to take more than just a few environmental groups it is going to take the governing authorities the corporate body and civil society working in collaboration to ensure that the harmful practices are eradicated from amongst the community
55,40,illegal dumping in abidjan19th august 2006 a cargo ship named probo koala delivered deadly shipment in abidjanivory coast the cargo contained toxic waste believed to contain harmful chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide caustic soda and gasoline barry mason 26 the waste had originated from europe and had been shipped to africa because the cost of treating it in europe was high selfishness and corruption are the main themes in the saga that led to the dismissal of the ivorian cabinet matters were made worse by the fact that the waste was dumped in open air sites in the capital city of abidjan
55,41,illegal dumping in abidjanthe effects of this dumping ranged from immediate effects on human and animals health to short and long term effects on the environment about ten lives were lost from the effects of the hazardous substance another 10000 were treated for symptoms ranging from vomiting to nose bleeding and breathing difficulties these symptoms were as a result of the dumping most of the 14 sites where the waste was dumped were close to farms and water sources this dumping seemed to negate the gains from the basel convention that had come in the wake of the 1988 toxic waste dumping in nigeria by the firm basel action network ban under these regulations it was wrong to allow the tanker to the amsterdam port
55,42,illegal dumping in abidjanthe dumping in the ivorian capital city abidjan was a manifestation of an old problem of the illegal dumping of toxic substances in poor countries by the developed nations this raises moral and ethical questions as well as raising environmental concerns it is quite unfortunate that unscrupulous people can endanger poor peoples life for gain the ivory coast dumping only happened because of the financial considerations the cost of treating the toxic waste was high for the trading company trafigura and so they chose the cheaper option for them at a high cost to the poor people of africa this is the usual trend in most instances where man destroys the environment the price is usually individual gain at the expense of the other inhabitants of the planet including animals and plants wanton destruction of forests industrial pollution careless toxic waste disposal practices and use of chemicals and gases that deplete the ozone layer are all motivated by selfish gain bullard robert d 1933
55,43,illegal dumping in abidjanthe bigger picture however can be viewed as mans determination to destroy the very environment that supports not only their life but all life on the planet environmental degradation is a global problem that has led to destruction of ecosystems that have existed for thousands of years this has destroyed the national habitats of various animals and birds as well as endangering the source of essentials such as fresh water and air pollution of the environment by motor vehicles as well as industrial waste requires our attention
55,44,illegal dumping in abidjana holistic approach that would involve all stakeholders groups need to be adopted to ensure that grave mistakes like the abidjan dumping are not repeated innovative ways of toxic waste treatment need to be applied especially by all countries with high production of hazardous substances indeed it is most important that stringent requirements be put in place to safeguard their effects on the environment
55,45,illegal dumping in abidjantreatment involves the process where the chemical or biological features of substances are changed to reduce the threat on the environment this is by far the most effective way of handling toxic waste several treatment technologies exist for different waste substances in developed countries treatment procedures are properly documented and these requirements need to be developed further to also be applicable universally additionally treatment can be a source of energy as well as raw materials for other products burning destroys and also reduces the volume of these substances and whenever applicable is the common method of treatment
55,46,illegal dumping in abidjandisposal is where waste is gotten rid of and put at a strategic site or facilities that are specially located and or designed to prevent the harmful pollutants to the environment a disposal method of putting the toxic substances on an open land site or landfill as in the case of the abidjan dumping is usually the most dangerous specially designed facilities called injection wells are used in the disposal of liquid toxic waste however these are expensive to build and thus many poor nations are not able to have them this makes them more vulnerable to the harmful effects of improperly disposed toxic waste however the biggest challenge to disposal of toxic waste remains their impact on water resources chemical substances beep through the surface of the earth and reach the water table and thus changing the composition of the water this is usually a process and the effects are usually long term volatile compounds also pose a challenge due to the potentially harmful emissions that result from their disposal inhalation of these chemicals poses a health risk to humans as well as other forms of life effects on water carelessly disposed toxic waste usually has a harmful impact on water sources apart from these substances being washed downstream by rain water toxic substances also seep through the soil changing the natural composition of the soil as well as affecting the underground water sources lee charles 26 47 this is a slow process and the effects are usually mild but long term in ivory coast the waste was dumped near water sources and this affected the people and animals that drank the contaminated water additionally since underground water is used by edible plants the crops planted near those sites were also affected apart from the immediate symptoms after eating or drinking contaminated food and water these chemical substances have been known to increase chances of cancer infection and other ailments
55,47,illegal dumping in abidjantoxic wastes like volatile organic compounds produce emissions that are harmful if inhaled by human and animals in developed countries like the us the resource conservation and recovery act rcra have developed requirements to control the emissions in the third world however the requirements are not as stringent and their enforcement is hampered by such problems as poor governance corruption and lack of education on the part of the population it is no wonder then that inhalation of emissions from dumped toxic waste caused the most harm adepoju g onibokun 12 similarly emissions change the composition of rain water as is the case of acid rain solution the solution to this multifaceted problem requires a holistic approach as well as the collaboration of all stakeholders industrialists nongovernmental organization and government departments need to come together in the search of sustainable solutions for this problem some of the solutions include more stringent requirements for toxic waste disposal practices these requirements need to be wide in scope to encompass the different facets of the problem they also need to be enforceable by a common body to avoid double standards stiffer penalties for offenders the 198 million is a poor comparison to the harm and suffering experienced by the residents of abidjan the environmental effects have not been wholly understood such irresponsible actions require stiffer penalties like seizure of business license use of innovative methods of toxic waste treatment modern methods have helped reduce the harmful effects of these substances installation costs may seem prohibitive especially to developing nations but the benefits far outweigh these costs responsible disposal dumping toxic waste in open landfills should never happen again due to the nature of the effects conclusion destruction of the environment through harmful human activities is one of the main challenges facing todays world industrial pollution deforestation and population growth leading to scarcity of resources have strained the available resources people are turning to environmentally unfriendly practices for short term financial gains with long term adverse effects on the environment bryant b paul m 34 65 a case in point is the dumping of hazardous waste by a rich multinational companytrafigura the effects of this are being felt to this day and have led to public outrage it is time that the international communities joined hands to put them to an end several solutions have been suggested in this section and it is believed that if implemented can reduce the destruction of the environment man has the ability to destroy the system that supports his life he also holds the key to reconstructing what has already been destroyed the choice is ours

67,2,TOP-LEVEL SEGMENTthe city center is situated on the banks of the saigon river from the south china sea and south of hanoi the capital of vietnam
67,3,TOP-LEVEL SEGMENTthe metropolitan area which consists of hồ chí minh city metro area thủ dầu một di an bien hoa and surrounding towns has more than 9 million people making it the largest metropolitan area in vietnam and indochina
67,4,origin of the namethe city was known by its original khmer inhabitants as prey nokor prey nokor means god or heavenly in khmer prey god nokor empirecity from sanskrit nagara the name prey nokor is still the name used in cambodia as of 2007 as well as the name used by the khmer krom minority living in the delta of the mekong
67,5,origin of the namedr keng vansak a famous frencheducated cambodian currently living in france describes that the original word of prey nokor is prey kor prey means forest all cambodian people recognize the word prey as forest only not god and kor is a kind of tree that its fruits can be produced cotton product prey kor became prey nokor because the khmer ethnic people want to refer to the place as a city nokor means city
67,6,origin of the nameafter prey nokor was settled by vietnamese refugees from the north in time it became known as sài gòn there is much debate about the origins of the vietnamese name sài gòn whose etymology is analyzed below
67,7,origin of the nameit should be noted however that before the french colonization the official vietnamese name of saigon was chu nom 嘉 定 in 1862 the french discarded this official name and adopted the name saigon which had always been the popular name
67,8,origin of the namefrom an orthographic point of view the vietnamese name sài gòn is written in two words which is the traditional convention in vietnamese spelling some people however write the name of the city as sàigòn or sàigòn in order to save space or give it a more westernized look
67,9,traditional vietnamese namea frequently heard and most reasonable explanation is that sài is a chinese loan word chinese 柴 pronounced in mandarin meaning firewood lops twigs palisade while gòn is another chinese loan word chinese 棍 pronounced gùn in mandarin meaning stick pole bole and whose meaning evolved into cotton in vietnamese bông gòn literally cotton stick ie cotton plant then shortened to gòn
67,10,traditional vietnamese namesome people say that this name originated from the many cotton plants that the khmer people had planted around prey nokor and which can still be seen at cây mai temple and surrounding areas
67,11,traditional vietnamese nameanother explanation is that the etymological meaning twigs sài and boles gòn refers to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city a forest to which the khmer name prey nokor already referred
67,12,traditional vietnamese namechinese people in vietnam and in china do not use the name 柴 棍 pronounced chaaigwan in cantonese and cháigùn in mandarin although etymologically speaking it is the chinese name from which the vietnamese name sài gòn is derived if the theory here is correct instead they call the city 西 貢 pronounced saigung in cantonese and in mandarin which is a mere phonetic transliteration of the name saigon
67,13,traditional vietnamese nameanother etymology often proposed although held now as a least likely etymology is that saigon comes from sai con which would be the transliteration of the khmer word prey kor meaning god or heavenly nokor is a khmer word of sanskrit origin meaning city land
67,14,traditional vietnamese namethis khmer etymology theory is quite interesting given the khmer context that existed when the first vietnamese settlers arrived in the region however it fails to completely explain how khmer prey led to vietnamese sài since these two syllables appear phonetically quite distinct and as the least reasonable and least likely candidate from the khmer etymology
67,15,traditional vietnamese nameanother reasonable etymology was offered by vương hồng sển a vietnamese scholar in the early 20th century who asserted that sài gòn had its origins in the cantonese name of cholon vietnamese quoc ngu chu nom the chinese district of saigon the cantonese and original name of cholon is taingon 堤 岸 which means embankment french quais the theory posits that sài gòn derives from taingon
67,16,origin of the nameon may 1 1975 after the fall of south vietnam the now ruling communist government renamed the city after the alias of their leader ho chi minh chu nom 胡 志 明 the official name is now thành chí minh thành means city often abbreviated tphcm in english this is translated as ho chi minh city abbreviated hcmc and in french it is translated as hô chi minh ville the circumflex is sometimes omitted abbreviated hcmv still the old name sài gònsaigon is widely used by vietnamese and is found in company names book titles and sometimes on airport departure boards the code for tan son nhat international airport is sgn the district 1 downtown is still called saigon the name saigon is extremely popular among vietnamese communities overseas they use saigon instead of ho chi minh city as a political point against the current communist government
67,17,historyho chi minh city began as a small fishing village known as prey nokor the area that the city now occupies was originally swampland and was inhabited by khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the vietnamese it should be noted that in khmer folklore that southern vietnam was given to the vietnamese government as a dowry for the marriage of a vietnamese princess to a khmer prince in order to stop constant invasions and pillaging of khmer villages
67,18,historyin 1623 king chey chettha ii of cambodia 16181628 allowed vietnamese refugees fleeing the trinhnguyen civil war in vietnam to settle in the area of prey nokor and to set up a custom house at prey nokor increasing waves of vietnamese settlers which the cambodian kingdom weakened because of war with thailand could not impede slowly vietnamized the area in time prey nokor became known as saigon in 1698 nguyen huu canh a vietnamese noble was sent by the nguyen rulers of huế to establish vietnamese administrative structures in the area thus detaching the area from cambodia which was not strong enough to intervene he is often credited with the expansion of saigon into a significant settlement a large vauban citadel called gia dinh has been built which was later destroyed by the french over the battle of chi hoa
