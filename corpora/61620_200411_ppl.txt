when america was struck by terrorists on september president bush immediately realized that it was an act of war not just a crime 
working with congress the president drew up plans to take the fight to the enemy vowing to bring the terrorists to justice or bring justice to the terrorists 
and together the president and congress took steps to help the wounded honor the dead and secure our homeland 
thanks to president bushs leadership the skill of the american military and the commitment of our allies today there are more than million newly free people in the nations of afghanistan and iraq and america is safer 
president bush worked with congress to lower taxes so americans can keep more of their own hardearned money to spend save or invest thereby growing our economy and putting people back to work 
he worked with congress to strengthen medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit and giving seniors more choices to meet their individual health care needs 
and the president worked with congress to pass historic education reforms to ensure that every child can read 
today higher standards and stronger accountability are getting results in classrooms across america 
our plans focus on ensuring that america remains safe terrorists are defeated and democracy flourishes in the world … 
on expanding opportunities for ownership and investment … 
on making tax relief permanent and ensuring greater energy independence … 
on increasing the affordability and accessibility of health care … 
on promoting works of compassion and strengthening our greatest values … 
on preparing students for success in life by bringing the benefits of education reform to high schools … 
and on helping workers adjust to a changing economy by offering flexible training options that meet their individual needs 
winning the war on terror … 
because our governments most solemn duty is to keep its citizens safe 
because a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit will keep our economy strong and provide more opportunities for workers and families 
because america can compete with anyone anywhere thanks to our entrepreneurs and risktakers who keep us on the cutting edge of technology and commerce 
because our children deserve to grow up in an america in which all their hopes and dreams can come true 
because we respect the familys role as a touchstone of stability and strength in an everchanging world 
president bush has confronted unprecedented challenges including a world scarred by terrorism 
the president and the american people have risen to the occasion by acting on a bold new statement of americas place and purpose in the world 
today we are filled with hope for the most dramatic advance of liberty in years 
president bushs leadership is rooted in the timeless values that have made america a unique and exalted nation respect for individual rights a deep commitment to freedom a desire to serve as a living example of the power of democracy 
the presidents leadership has achieved successes once deemed impossible to realize in so short a period of time 
his forwardlooking strategy for freedom and peace is making progress in every part of the world 
the president and republicans in congress recognize that new threats demand new tools and new methods for defending america and promoting our goals in the world 
they have responded swiftly to the challenges of a new era rather than remaining wedded to outdated theories and fighting battles that ended long ago 
their accomplishments are the foundation upon which future progress will be built 
the world changed on september and since that day under the strong steady and visionary leadership of president george w bush americans have helped make the world not only safer but better 
the president continues to lead a steady confident systematic campaign to defend america against the dangers of our time 
we are going after terrorists wherever they plot and plan and hide changing the old course of pinprick strikes that did little to get at the root of terrorism 
we eliminated many of al qaedas key leaders and put the world on notice that nations that train harbor or finance terrorists are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves 
we will not allow the worlds most dangerous regimes to possess the worlds most dangerous weapons 
our message is getting through as indicated by libyas leader who decided to turn over his weapons of mass destruction and cooperate with the international community 
today because america has acted and because america has led the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat and america and the world are safer 
on september we saw the cruelty of the terrorists and we glimpsed the future they intend for us 
they intend to strike the united states to the limits of their power 
they seek weapons of mass destruction to kill americans on an even greater scale 
this danger is increased when outlaw regimes build or acquire weapons of mass destruction and maintain ties to terrorist groups 
on september we saw the spirit of courage and optimism of the american people that greatest assurance of the ultimate triumph of our cause 
courage and optimism led colleagues to help each other in escaping from collapsing buildings 
courage and optimism led policemen firefighters emergency medical professionals public works employees our men and women in uniform and selfless volunteers to run into burning buildings to save others and undertake a mammoth rescue and recovery effort 
courage and optimism led the passengers on flight to rush their murderers to save lives on the ground 
courage and optimism led americas parents and teachers to battle their own fears to keep children calm and safe 
in those and countless other acts of heroism on that day and many times since terrorists have learned that americans will not be intimidated 
we will fight them with everything we have and we will prevail 
president bush answered the challenge of september not only with steadfast resolve but also with vision optimism and unshakable confidence in the will and faith of the american people 
that is what we all saw on september when our president stood with the brave workers at ground zero and resolutely assured our nation amidst our shock anger and grief that while the terrorists had struck first america would have the last word 
the presidents most solemn duty is to protect our country 
george w bush has kept that charge 
to protect our people president bush is leading america staying on the offensive against threats within our own country 
he worked with congress to establish the department of homeland security in the most significant reorganization of the federal government since 
the patriot act is being used to track terrorist activity and to break up terror cells 
now the fbi can use tools that have been long available to fight organized crime and drug trafficking but could not be used in the past to fight terrorism 
intelligence and law enforcement officials are sharing information as never before 
the president transformed the mission of the fbi to focus first and foremost on preventing terrorism 
every element of americas homeland security plan is critical because the terrorists are ruthless and resourceful and we know they are preparing to attack us again 
it is not possible to guarantee perfect security in our vast free nation 
but the president and vice president along with many fine professionals in intelligence homeland security law enforcement and the military are working tirelessly to protect the country 
we are grateful to them all 
president bush recognized that to overcome the dangers of our time america would have to take a new approach in the world 
that approach is marked by a determination to challenge new threats not ignore them or simply wait for future tragedy and by a renewed commitment to building a hopeful future in hopeless places instead of allowing troubled regions to remain in despair and explode in violence 
before entering office president bush recognized that our age is a time of opportunity for america opportunity to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty 
that conviction is in the finest traditions of the republican party 
as our platform said in during the height of cold war confrontation the supreme purpose of our foreign policy must be to maintain our freedom in a peaceful international environment in which the united states and our allies and friends are secure against military threats and democratic governments are flourishing in a world of increasing prosperity ” 
the reality of does not diminish our generations opportunity to advance the cause of freedom but in fact makes it all the more important that we take up that challenge 
president bush has rallied america to its calling to make the world safer and better 
this calling is answered by a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests 
americans everywhere are remaining faithful to that duty 
by keeping our word and holding firm to our values this generation is showing the world the power of liberty once again 
republicans support president bushs steadfast commitment to the goal of a lasting democratic peace in which all nations are free from the threat of sudden terror 
we affirm the three commitments of the presidents strategy for peace 
• terrorists long ago declared war on america and now america has declared war against terrorists 
we are defending the peace by taking the fight to the enemy 
we are confronting terrorists overseas so we do not have to confront them here at home 
we are destroying the leadership of terrorist networks in sudden raids disrupting their planning and financing and keeping them on the run 
month by month we are shrinking the space in which they can freely operate by denying them territory and the support of governments 
•nations that support terrorism are just as dangerous and just as guilty as the perpetrators of terrorism 
every nation must make a choice to support terror or to support america and our coalition to defeat terror 
we are preserving the peace by working with more than allied nations as well as international institutions to isolate and confront terrorists and outlaw regimes 
america is leading a broad coalition of nations to disrupt proliferation 
we are working with the united nations the international atomic energy agency and other international organizations to take action in our common security 
the global threat of terrorism requires a global response 
to be effective that global response requires leadership and america is leading 
•there is no negotiation with terrorists 
no form of therapy or coercion will turn them from their murderous ways 
only total and complete destruction of terrorism will allow freedom to flourish 
we will extend the peace by supporting the rise of democracy and the hope and progress that democracy brings as the alternative to hatred and terror in the broader middle east 
in democratic societies men and women do not swear allegiance to malcontents and murderers they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives 
democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their neighbors 
when justice and democracy advance so does the hope of lasting peace 
we are proud of the presidents steady leadership in executing this strategy 
we are dealing with terrorist threats as they gather rather than waiting for them to become imminent dangers 
the results are clear to see 
•three years ago our nation was not on a war footing against al qaeda even though osama bin laden declared war on the united states in and again in 
the al qaeda leadership believed itself to be impervious to any american response continued to raise funds practically without restriction and operated in a world in which there was no cohesive global approach to fighting terror 
today al qaeda has been wounded having lost many of its known leaders and most of its important sanctuaries 
america and its allies and friends have broken al qaeda cells here in the united states and overseas 
a global coalition led by the united states has dried up sources of terrorist financing 
thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel remain on the manhunt going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves 
today because of the solidarity of the international coalition in the war on terror we are bringing these terrorists to justice and the american people are safer 
•three years ago al qaedas secure home base was in afghanistan a country ruled by the taliban one of the most backward and brutal regimes of modern history 
schooling was denied to girls 
women were whipped and executed in public 
millions lived in fear 
with protection from the taliban al qaeda and its associates trained indoctrinated and sent forth thousands of killers to set up terror cells in dozens of countries including our own 
today afghanistan is a world away from the nightmare of the taliban 
twentyeight million people are free 
that country has a good and just president 
boys and girls are being educated 
women are respected 
many refugees have returned home to rebuild their country and a presidential election is scheduled for this fall 
the terror camps are closed and the afghan government is helping us to hunt the taliban and terrorists in remote regions 
today because we acted to liberate afghanistan a threat has been removed and the american people are safer 
•three years ago pakistan was one of the few countries in the world that recognized the taliban regime 
al qaeda was active and recruiting in pakistan 
pakistan served as a transit point for al qaeda terrorists leaving afghanistan on missions of murder 
the united states could not count on the support of pakistans military and civilian leaders the very people we would need to help shut down al qaeda operations in that part of the world 
today the governments of the united states and pakistan are working closely in the fight against terror 
pakistan has helped capture khalid sheik mohammed the operational planner behind the september attacks and other terrorists 
pakistani forces are rounding up terrorists along their nations western border 
today because we are working with pakistani leaders pakistan is an ally in the war on terror and the american people are safer 
•three years ago terrorists were wellestablished in saudi arabia 
inside that country fundraisers and other facilitators gave al qaeda financial and logistical help with little scrutiny or opposition 
today after the attacks in riyadh and elsewhere the saudi government knows that al qaeda is its enemy 
saudi arabia is working hard to shut down the facilitators and financial supporters of terrorism 
the government has captured or killed many firsttier leaders of the al qaeda organization in saudi arabia 
today because saudi arabia has seen the danger and has joined the war on terror the american people are safer 
•three years ago the ruler of iraq was a sworn enemy of america who provided safe haven for terrorists used weapons of mass destruction and turned his nation into a prison 
saddam hussein was not just a dictator he was a proven mass murderer who refused to account for weapons of mass murder 
he defied the international community and seventeen united nations resolutions over the course of twelve years giving no indication that iraq would ever disarm and comply with the just demands of the world 
in in resolution the united nations security council unanimously voted that saddam hussein had one final chance to comply with his obligations to the international community or there would be serious consequences 
as he had for over a decade he refused to comply 
every responsible nation recognized this threat and knew it could not go on forever 
today the dictator who caused decades of death and turmoil who twice invaded his neighbors who harbored terrorist leaders who used chemical weapons on innocent men women and children finally stands before the bar of justice 
iraq which once had the worst government in the middle east is now becoming an example of reform to the region 
iraqi security forces are fighting beside coalition troops to defeat the terrorists and foreign fighters who threaten their nation and the world 
today because america and our coalition helped to end the violent regime of saddam hussein and because we are helping to raise a peaceful democracy in its place million iraqis are free and the american people are safer 
•three years ago the nation of libya a longtime supporter of terror was spending millions to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons 
today thousands of libyas chemical munitions have been destroyed 
libyas nuclear equipment that could ultimately have threatened the lives of hundreds of thousands is stored away in the united states 
today because the libyan government saw the seriousness of the civilized world and correctly judged its own interests the american people are safer 
•three years ago a private weapons proliferation network was doing business around the world 
this network operated by the pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan was selling nuclear plans and equipment to the highest bidder and found willing buyers in places like libya iran and north korea 
today the aq khan network is out of business 
we have ended one of the most dangerous sources of proliferation in the world and the american people are safer 
republicans applaud president bush vice president cheney and those who have supported them in the congress for the steady leadership that led to these successes 
america must stay the course 
in afghanistan and iraq our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals 
republicans believe that america and the world must keep our commitments to the people of those countries who are building the worlds newest democracies and counting on the world to help 
delivering these nations from tyranny has required sacrifice and loss 
we must honor that sacrifice by finishing the great work we have begun 
republicans appreciate the military financial and technical assistance provided by the dozens of nations contributing to the reconstruction of afghanistan and iraq 
the success of free and stable governments in afghanistan iraq and elsewhere will further shrink the space in which terrorists can operate 
as the entire region sees the promise of freedom in its midst the terrorist ideology will become more and more irrelevant until that day when it is viewed with contempt or ignored altogether 
the forces of many nations are working with afghans to find and defeat taliban remnants and eliminate al qaeda terrorists 
we applaud the work of american forces and coalition partners in helping to build the new afghan national army and to train new afghan police and border patrol 
together afghan and international forces will maintain the peace secure afghanistans borders and deny terrorists any foothold in that country 
we applaud president bushs announcement of us support for five new initiatives that will help the afghan people achieve the peace stability and prosperity they deserve through support for the development of democracy educational assistance cultural exchanges enhanced bilateral economic ties and increased economic opportunity for women 
the road ahead for afghanistan is still long and difficult 
yet the afghan people can know that their country will never be abandoned to terrorists and killers 
the world and the united states look forward to elections this year in afghanistan and stand with the afghan people as partners in their quest for peace and prosperity stability and democracy 
as republicans we do not equivocate as others have done about whether america should have gone to war in iraq 
the best intelligence available at the time indicated that saddam hussein was a threat 
on that point president bush members of both parties in congress and the united nations agreed 
while the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction we expected to find in iraq have not yet materialized we have confirmed that saddam hussein had the capability to reconstitute his weapons programs and the desire to do so 
our nation did the right thing and the american people are now safer because we and our allies ended the brutal dictatorship of saddam hussein halting his decadeslong pursuit of chemical biological and nuclear weapons 
president bush had a choice to make trust a madman or defend america 
he chose defending america 
supported by brave coalition allies such as the united kingdom australia italy poland and denmark 
and displaying courage skill and resourcefulness on the battlefield the men and women of our armed forces removed the dictator of iraq a declared enemy of america who had the capability and intent to produce weapons of mass murder and could have passed that capability to terrorists bent on killing americans 
that was a risk we could not take 
americas men and women in uniform have been unrelenting in the performance of their duty 
our nation has asked much of our military and there is still much hard work ahead 
we are proud of the sacrifice made by all who have served and are serving and we are immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by their families and loved ones 
further we honor the memories of those who have died in combat serving the cause of freedom 
defending our homeland with their ultimate sacrifice on behalf of all americans merits our prayers and our thanksgiving 
we also commit to continued honor and care for our wounded veterans and support for all who return home from service 
together we look forward to that day when the war on terror is won and our military can return home no longer at risk our world and our country safer 
we also salute our coalition allies 
their efforts with us to shape a world where freedom is honored and liberty is cherished deserves respect and admiration their sacrifice too does not go without notice and appreciation 
we are ever mindful that american troops remain on the ground in iraq working steadfastly to help the iraqi people achieve stability and democracy 
we therefore welcome declarations from responsible political leaders of both parties that our nation will persevere in our mission there not cut and run 
the american people need to hear this message 
people in baghdad and beyond need to hear it 
the enemy needs to hear it 
most importantly american soldiers sailors airmen and marines risking their lives in iraq need to hear it 
we condemn inconsistent ambiguous and politically expedient statements on that point 
to the extent such wavering encourages our adversaries to fight harder our men and women in uniform suffer the consequences 
their mission is difficult enough 
uncertainty about americas commitment to that mission makes it immeasurably more difficult 
in iraq america is serving the cause of liberty peace and our own security 
america accepted a difficult task in iraq 
we know that for all these reasons we will finish that task 
we also know that iraqi sovereignty is a tribute to the will of the iraqi people and the courage of iraqi leaders 
it is a proud moral achievement for members of our coalition 
we have full confidence in the plan for iraqi selfgovernment that is currently being implemented by iraqs interim government 
that government has gained broad international support and has been endorsed by the united nations security council 
the united states and our coalition partners are helping prepare iraqis for the defense of their own country including through the work of the nato mission to train iraqi security forces 
we are helping iraqis rebuild their countrys infrastructure and iraq is continuing to move toward free elections with important assistance from the united nations 
we applaud president bush for establishing a visionary and resolute policy a forward strategy of freedom in the middle east to stand with the people of that region as they seek their future in freedom 
republicans support president bushs policy of working with every government in the middle east dedicated to destroying the terrorist networks while in the longer term expecting a higher standard of reform and democracy from our friends in the region 
we believe that democracy and reform will make those nations stronger and more stable and make the world more secure by undermining terrorism at its source 
as a result of president bushs leadership g members adopted the broader middle east and north africa initiative at this years sea island summit 
we applaud the commitment of the worlds leading industrial nations to this historic initiative to support political economic and social reform throughout the region 
republicans agree with the bush administration that there is no greater danger to our people than the nexus of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction wmd 
that judgment is shared by leading allies and friends 
as president bush and his fellow g leaders declared in the spread of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism constitute the preeminent threat to international security ” 
the risks posed by this dangerous relationship can not be contained or deterred by traditional means 
•ensure that international agreements against the proliferation of wmd are observed and enforced 
• detect disrupt and block the spread of dangerous weapons and technology 
•confront emerging threats from any person or state before those threats have fully materialized and 
•improve our capabilities to respond to the use of wmd and minimize the consequences of an attack 
•ended saddam husseins decadeslong pursuit of chemical biological and nuclear weapons 
• achieved the elimination of libyas wmd and ballistic missile programs 
• shut down the aq khan nuclear proliferation network 
•led the proliferation security initiative to interdict dangerous wmd and their means of delivery 
•strengthened efforts to secure weaponsusable materials and sensitive technologies in the former soviet union and elsewhere 
•insisted on confronting the threat from north korea through sixparty talks involving the republic of korea japan china and russia 
•supported the work of the international atomic energy agency to hold the iranian regime to its treaty obligations 
• strengthened international nonproliferation export control and treaty regimes 
•secured unanimous passage of united nations security council resolution which requires states to enact legislation that criminalizes proliferation activities and 
•achieved agreement among the g nations to refrain for one year from initiating new transfers of uranium enrichment and reprocessing technology to additional states 
•creating biodefense for the st century a national strategy for meeting the full range of biological threats 
•signing into law project bioshield which provides new tools to improve medical countermeasures protecting americans against a chemical biological radiological or nuclear attack 
• putting in place major new biodefense capabilities 
•creating the container security initiative to screen cargo destined for the united states and 
• deploying missile defenses to defend the united states and its friends and allies 
libyas decision to disclose and dismantle its wmd programs is a product of the presidents strategy that gives regimes a choice 
they can choose to pursue wmd at great peril and cost including international isolation 
or they can choose to renounce these weapons take steps to rejoin the international community and have its help in creating a better future for their citizens 
the libya case also demonstrates the presidents success in forging increased international cooperation to prevent the spread of wmd technology through his groundbreaking proliferation security initiative a broad international partnership to coordinate actions to interdict proliferation shipments of wmd and related materials and shut down proliferation networks and entities 
republicans applaud the support of more than nations in this crucial multilateral effort to stop the trade in weapons of mass destruction and their related components 
we commend the presidents leadership in expanding greatly the resources to prevent proliferation including recordlevel us and multilateral resources devoted to the nunnlugar programs and other nonproliferation assistance including that made available through the creation of the g global partnership which will provide billion to this effort over years 
we hail the commitment of the other g nations the united kingdom japan italy canada germany france and russia to this vital initiative as well as commitments by other countries including poland finland norway sweden switzerland and australia 
republicans share president bushs understanding that in an age in which the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the worlds most destructive technologies the united states can not remain idle while dangers gather 
we therefore believe that to forestall or prevent hostile acts by our adversaries the united states must if necessary act preemptively 
republicans recognize that our progress in the war on terror has been achieved with the help of other responsible nations 
we hail the strong and broadbased cooperation of americas allies in the war on terror 
we are grateful to the more than nations with forces serving in iraq and the nearly nations with forces serving in afghanistan 
in the fight against terror america has asked our allies to do hard things 
they have taken up these responsibilities in a spirit of solidarity that america should never forget 
we applaud president bush for his success in mobilizing such international cooperation in the war on terror which the commission judges to be on a vastly enlarged scale and to have expanded dramatically since september 
we also question the credibility of our opponents who claim to support global alliances while nominating a candidate who has insulted our allies by calling the nations fighting in iraq windowdressing and referring to them as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed 
directing ugly rhetoric at americas allies in a time of war is irresponsible 
it does not represent the gratitude and respect the vast majority of americans have for the men and women from other nations who are risking their lives to make the world safer 
republicans welcome the enlargement of nato which has strengthened historys most successful alliance 
the atlantic alliance has widened the circle of its friends while also creating a new chapter in our relationship with russia 
under president bushs leadership the united states is working with responsible governments and international institutions to convince the leaders of north korea and iran that their nuclear weapons ambitions are deeply contrary to their own interests 
with allies america has launched the broader middle east initiative to encourage reform and democracy throughout the region a project that will shape the history of our times for the better 
our nation is helping governments fight poverty and disease so they do not become failed states and future havens for terror 
the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements 
all of them are being transformed to meet the challenge of defending america in a new era 
in this endeavor america will rely as always on the character and skill of our citizens especially the bravery pride and hard work of americas men and women in the military our first responders our diplomats and our law enforcement and intelligence agents 
•streamline the federal government to make it more effective at combating terrorism 
• tighten security at entry points like ports airports and borders 
•strengthen protections at critical infrastructure landmarks such as power and water plants and 
• reduce the threats of bioterrorism and cyberterrorism 
through all their actions president bush and congress have been careful to protect the rights and liberties that make america a beacon of freedom and justice 
the president and congress have also provided unprecedented resources to support local first responders 
the men and women of the department of homeland security and the first responders at the state and local level with whom they have partnered vigilantly safeguard the security of america each and every day 
they have moved swiftly but thoughtfully to direct enhanced resources to counter the dangers of the new and shifting threats we face and they have proved themselves equal to the task 
• coast guard in protecting our shores 
• customs and border patrol who police our borders 
•air marshals and baggage screeners of the transportation security administration in safeguarding our airports and our skies 
•immigrations and customs enforcement in ensuring that the identity of foreign citizens who enter our borders is known 
•directorate of information analysis and infrastructure protection and the secret service for partnering with private industry to protect millions of americans by enhancing security at chemical plants and other critical infrastructure 
•federal bureau of investigation in applying enhanced law enforcement tools provided by the patriot act to track down terrorists and thwart their plots before they can be executed to murderous effect 
•centers for disease control and the national institutes of health for their work in safeguarding the nation from biological attacks and 
•law enforcement officers firefighters ems personnel and other first responders in state and local jurisdictions throughout the country who have diligently employed increased federal resources to train and prepare for the prevention and mitigation of future terrorist attacks 
these dedicated men and women the nations last line of defense and first hope in response give their utmost every day to keep us safe 
just as the cold war prompted a massive reorganization of the federal governments foreign policy apparatus the war on terror demanded a thorough reorganization of americas domestic preparedness agencies 
president bush led this effort with a plan to merge separate government entities into the new department of homeland security a cohesive department with the primary mission of keeping america safe 
after the american people returned control of the senate to republicans in the midterm elections congress passed legislation enacting the presidents plan 
further to ensure that americas law enforcement intelligence and first responders have the resources they need to protect america president bush and congress have nearly tripled homeland security funding since 
we endorse the efforts of president bush and republicans in congress to keep our homeland safe by taking action on multiple fronts all aimed at stopping terrorists before they strike 
• the fbi has been refocused to track down terrorists before they attack 
• the treasury department is now leading the effort to find and eliminate sources of terrorist financing around the world 
since september the united states and our allies have designated terroristrelated entities and frozen more than million in terrorist assets in more than accounts worldwide 
•the president signed into law the patriot act which gives law enforcement and intelligence agents the same tools to fight terror that have long been available to fight organized crime and drug trafficking 
the patriot act also made it possible for law enforcement and intelligence agents to share information and coordinate efforts to prevent terrorism 
the commission rightly praised the patriot acts role in improving information sharing 
•since the patriot act was passed four terrorist cells have been broken up inside the united states and more than individuals have been convicted or pled guilty to terrorismrelated offenses 
president bush knows that americas firefighters local law enforcement and other first responders play a critical role in protecting the homeland 
hundreds of firefighters and police officers gave their lives to help their fellow citizens on september and should another attack ever come they will be first at the scene again 
they must have the tools they need to perform their jobs as safely and effectively as possible 
to this end the president and congress have massively increased spending for our nations first responders 
they have worked with governors mayors and tribal and local leaders to implement an integrated and federally supported approach to protecting communities 
• states and localities have received more than billion since 
• assistance to firefighter grants are up percent since 
•state domestic preparedness funding is up more than percent since 
president bush has taken steps to send money to the areas that are most at risk of terrorist attack and instituted measures to speed the money to the first responders on the ground 
president bush has overhauled and greatly enhanced security at the nations airports 
our infrastructure to protect airplanes passengers crews and cargo from terrorist acts has never been stronger than it is today 
cockpit doors have been hardened more than air marshals and federal screeners have been hired new screening technology has been developed and percent of commercial air passengers and checked bags are now screened 
as tagging and tracking citizens is inconsistent with american freedom we oppose the creation of a national identification card or system 
proposed funding for port security in represents a percent increase since president bush came to office 
• all cargo is now screened by customs agents 
•screening takes place in foreign ports well before potentially dangerous cargo ever reaches our shores and 
• all highrisk cargo is physically inspected 
our nation has been enriched by immigrants seeking a better life 
in many cases immigrants of the past fled violence and oppression searching for peace and freedom 
all suffered and sacrificed but hoped for a better future for their children in america 
our nation has been enriched by their determination energy and diversity 
ensuring the integrity of our borders is vital to ensuring the safety of our citizens 
we must know the identity of all visitors who enter the united states and we must know when they leave 
the usvisit system which uses biometric data to better track the entry and exit of foreign travelers has been implemented at more than airports and is presently being implemented at land border crossings 
reconnaissance cameras border patrol agents and unmanned aerial flights have all been increased at our borders 
we must strengthen our border patrol to stop illegal crossings and we will equip the border patrol with the tools technologies structures and sufficient force necessary to secure the border 
we will seek stiff penalties for those who smuggle illegal aliens into the country and for those who sell fraudulent documents 
we urge continued support for state local and federal law enforcement to work in a cohesive manner in securing our borders to prevent illegal entry 
most critical infrastructure is not federally owned or operated requiring cooperation from all levels of government and private industry for effective protection 
as part of a nationwide review of critical infrastructure initiated by president bush due to be completed by december the department of homeland security has already identified the highestrisk chemical sites and partnered with industry to enhance protections at those sites 
we endorse the presidents request to have the department of homeland security establish minimum safety requirements at chemical plants and enforce compliance when voluntary measures are deemed inadequate 
it is no secret that the enemies of the united states are determined to acquire and use biological and chemical weapons 
the potential exists for terrorists to use genetically engineered bioweapons that incorporate some of the deadliest diseases known to man such as anthrax ebola smallpox sarin or ricin 
such weapons are capable of inflicting grievous harm on any nation caught unprepared 
for this reason president george w bush has long made bolstering the nations defenses against bioterrorism a central focus of his administration 
•increase the federal bioterrorism budget by more than percent from million in to billion in 
•expand bioterror research by an even greater margin from million in to billion in an increase of more than percent 
•increase the size of the strategic national stockpile of vaccines and countermeasures by percent since and 
•further secure more than billion to enhance the stockpile and to encourage the development of new vaccines and countermeasures 
although there is no such thing as perfect safety from biological attacks president bushs historic commitment to building up the biological defenses of the united states has made us far less vulnerable to the threat of bioterrorism than we were just three years ago 
the presidents continuing commitment to implement further biodefense projects holds the promise of an even more secure future 
republicans recognize the critical new role played by the us coast guard in upholding americas maritime security against terrorist threats 
our nation saw the dedication and the versatility of the coast guard in the aftermath of september a performance that demonstrated the coast guards vital contribution to homeland security 
we applaud the men and women of the coast guard for rising to meet new challenges even as they continue to accomplish traditional missions such as search and rescue navigation assistance drug interdiction fisheries enforcement and environmental protection 
we also applaud the coast guard men and women who serve and have served in the persian gulf and the mediterranean in operation iraqi freedom 
under the leadership of president bush and the republican congress our nation has significantly increased budget support for the coast guard to achieve its expanded mission 
we affirm the importance of continued strong support including for efforts to recapitalize and enlarge the coast guards fleet a critical component of our overall national fleet 
this should not be done at the expense of or by in any way reducing the us navys shipbuilding program 
our nation asks much of the men and women of the coast guard uniformed warfighters who serve on the front line of the war on terror 
we applaud the president and the republican congress for ensuring that the service has the resources needed to accomplish its expanded mission 
republicans believe that just as our nation relies on our men and women in uniform to fight and win the war on terror we also depend on americas diplomats who serve in the vanguard of our present struggle 
•help establish stable and democratic governments in nations such as afghanistan and iraq that once supported terrorism 
• support frontline states and coalition partners 
•deepen counterterrorism intelligence and law enforcement cooperation with allies and friends and 
• energetically promote democracy especially in the broader middle east 
in all of these areas and more the professionals of americas foreign affairs agencies serve at the front line of advancing us national interests and values 
we salute their strong record of achievement during this consequential era of american foreign policy and support the efforts of president bush and the republican congress to provide the department of state funding sufficient to ensure the continued success of american diplomacy 
republicans believe that intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states 
the dedicated hardworking men and women of our intelligence community are laboring every day to keep our country safe 
republicans are proud of their work and grateful for their service 
americas intelligence professionals have been pivotal to the major successes in the war on terror disrupting multiple planned terrorist attacks around the world continuing to expand our insight into terrorist organizations and plans and greatly enhancing working relationships with foreign partners 
working together the president and the republican congress have steadfastly advanced toward the goal of an integrated unified national intelligence effort 
they have taken important steps to expand and strengthen americas intelligence system and capabilities including reversing devastating cuts in the intelligence community budget and closing dangerous gaps between counterterrorism intelligence collected abroad and at home by creating the terrorist threat integration center and consolidating all us government watchlist information on suspected terrorists in the new terrorist screening center 
they have also broken down the unnecessary wall between intelligence and law enforcement with the patriot act 
because it has proved to be instrumental in helping to break up terror cells and plots and seizing terrorist assets republicans believe that congress needs to reauthorize this important law 
we applaud president bushs continued strong leadership in intelligence reform 
•increasing both the quality and quantity of human intelligence collection to disrupt terrorist attacks 
•investing more in our technical intelligence capabilities so that we stay ahead of our enemies changing communications technology and tactics and 
• ensuring the most effective and coordinated use of these resources and personnel 
it is essential that the people in government responsible for defending america and countering terrorism have the best possible information to make the best decisions about the safety of our country 
we therefore support president bushs request to congress to create the position of a national intelligence director to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate 
the national intelligence director will serve as the presidents principal intelligence advisor and will oversee the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community 
we also support president bushs plan to establish a national counterterrorism center that will build on the analytical work of the terrorist threat integration center and become our governments knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists 
the new center will coordinate and monitor counterterrorism plans and activities of all government agencies and departments to ensure effective joint action and to ensure that our efforts are unified in priority and purpose 
the center will also be responsible for preparing the daily terrorism threat report for the president and senior officials 
we also support president bushs judgment that legislative oversight of intelligence and homeland security must be restructured and made more effective 
currently there are too many committees with overlapping jurisdiction which wastes time and makes it difficult for meaningful oversight and reform 
americas men and women in uniform are currently on the front lines of the war on terror 
in the midst of a global struggle the armed services continue to meet their goals for new recruits and retentions and every american is grateful for the patriotism and honor of these soldiers sailors airmen and marines 
republicans hail their historic achievements since september especially the removal of the repressive regimes of the taliban and saddam hussein 
their victories on the battlefield have not only made america safer but are making way for new governments in afghanistan and iraq 
they are paving the way for societies that are free 
with the support of the republican congress president bush has consistently built defense strength 
defense spending has only been higher twice since world war ii during the korean war and at the peak of the cold war buildup 
these longoverdue budget increases help fulfill the presidents commitments and ensure a fighting force that is second to none 
in the president promised to provide members of the armed forces better pay better treatment and better training 
he has fulfilled that promise to our troops 
supported by the republican congress president bush has increased basic pay by nearly percent 
many servicemembers have seen much more than that 
the increase in basic salary and payments for food and housing has reached nearly percent 
we hail those muchdeserved increases as well as the action of the president and the republican congress in this years defense appropriations act to fund permanent increases for the family separation allowance and imminent danger pay 
until the mid s servicemembers who lived offbase were expected to pay for percent of their housing costs 
in reality this cost grew to almost percent 
republicans applaud the leadership of the president and the republican congress for making sure that by the end of outofpocket expenses will be eliminated meaning that the average servicemember who lives offbase will have all basic housing costs covered 
president bush and the republican congress have also increased funds for defense health programs including improving medical services for ready reserve members and their families 
the men and women of the national guard and reserve are an important part of the nations military readiness and we will maintain their strength in the states 
their role as citizen soldiers must continue to be a proud tradition that links every community in the country with the cause of national security 
we affirm traditional military culture and we affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service 
the republican party created the allvolunteer force and opposes reinstitution of the draft whether directly or through compulsory national service 
we support the advancement of women in the military support their exemption from ground combat units and support the implementation of the recommendations of the kassebaum commission which unanimously recommended that coed basic training be ended 
we support sound priorities in the making of personnel policies and candid analysis of the consequences of unprecedented social changes in the military 
as the traditional advocate of americas veterans the republican party has continued to fulfill americas obligations to them 
when president bush took office many of the programs designed to assist veterans cried out for modernization and reform 
president bush and congress have increased funding for va health care by more than percent since 
this additional funding has made it possible for the va to improve health care access for veterans who need it most including lowincome veterans those with servicerelated disabilities and those who need vas specialized services 
president bush signed into law authorization for the concurrent receipt of both military retired pay and va disability compensation for combatinjured and highlydisabled veterans 
we support these actions to keep faith with americas veterans and applaud president bush and the republican congress for attending to the solemn duty of maintaining and expanding our national cemeteries 
in promising better training the president committed to strengthen the military readiness of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines 
since taking office the president has added billions to operations and maintenance accounts to make good on this promise 
this investment is paying off as critical readiness indicators are improving 
however the real proof of military readiness is combat performance 
our combined military forces have demonstrated overwhelming combat effectiveness in afghanistan iraq and in other operations around the world 
the readiness of us armed forces to carry out combat operations anywhere in the world is now unparalleled 
the vast majority of americans agree that when our troops are engaged in battle we have a responsibility to provide everything they need to complete their mission 
it is irresponsible for public officials to support sending americans into battle and then reject the funding they need for such things as ammunition body armor and better health care for their dependents 
we call to account the democratic nominees for president and vice president both of whom voted to authorize war in iraq then later rejected legislation to provide billion in critical supplies and benefits for servicemembers and their families 
earlier this year senator kerry claimed to have voted for the billion before he voted against it 
recently he said he was proud of his vote against supporting our troops 
and in yet another attempt to explain his irresponsible vote senator kerry claimed his decision was complicated 
republicans affirm that there is nothing complicated about supporting soldiers in battle 
americas commander in chief must always support the men and women on the frontlines and we applaud president bush for his steadfast support of our military 
president bush also fulfilled his promise to begin transforming how our nation organizes and equips itself to fight st century adversaries 
leveraging rapidly changing technology with flexible organizations and adaptable doctrine the president and the republican congress have led the transformation of the us military to become lighter faster and more lethal 
•double investment in missile defense systems to put america on track to field an operational system in 
• dramatically increase rd investments 
• commit a significant amount of the procurement budget to transformation and 
• pursue transformational programs across the services such as the armys future combat system the navys conversion of ballistic missile submarines to guided missile submarines and the air forces unmanned combat aerial vehicles 
in december president bush directed the deployment of a missile defense system to protect the united states from the threat of longrange missiles with the ability to deliver weapons of mass destruction 
the defense appropriations act provides billion for systems to defend against the threat from ballistic missiles 
later this year the first components of americas missile defense system will become operational 
this will fulfill a pledge that president bush made to the american people more than four years ago 
america and our allies face a deadly threat from ballistic missiles armed with the worlds most dangerous weapons 
republicans affirm that america must deploy the technologies necessary to protect our people 
republicans applaud president bushs announcement of the most comprehensive restructuring of us military forces overseas since the end of the korean war 
by closing bases overseas that are no longer needed to meet cold war threats that have ended his new initiative will bring home many cold warera forces while deploying more flexible and rapidly deployable capabilities in strategic locations around the world 
the plan will make america safer by better preparing our military to address the new dangers associated with rogue nations global terrorism and weapons of mass destruction 
it will also give our servicemembers more time on the home front and fewer moves over a career 
it will give military spouses fewer job changes and offer greater stability for their families 
it will save the taxpayers money by closing hundreds of unneeded facilities around the world 
republicans know that workers in the defense industry and broader civilian sector including manufacturing workers engineers scientists and farmers who supply our armed forces with cuttingedge weapons combat materiel and sustenance are also vital to the success of our troops on the battlefield 
we hail their indispensable contributions to victory in the war on terror 
republicans applaud president bush for launching groundbreaking efforts to address the needs and hopes of the worlds poor cutting across traditional boundaries to focus on what works 
we agree with president bush that the united states must use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe by actively working to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world 
the events of september taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states 
poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers 
yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders 
republicans believe that a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than a day is neither just nor stable 
we applaud president bush and the republican congress for their leadership and moral clarity in making the inclusion of all of the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity one of the top priorities of us international policy 
decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries 
worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery 
results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients 
these are the indicators of a failed strategy 
working with other nations and under the leadership of president bush and the republican congress the united states has confronted this failure 
president bush helped to forge a new consensus at the united nations conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change 
republicans support the presidents goal to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations 
sustained growth and poverty reduction are impossible without the right national policies 
where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance 
the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the worlds poorest economies within a decade 
•providing resources through the millennium challenge account to aid countries that have met the challenge of reform 
•improving the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards 
•insisting upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the worlds poor 
•increasing the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans 
• opening societies to commerce and investment 
•enhancing public health in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hivaids malaria and tuberculosis 
•emphasizing education literacy and learning as the foundation of democracy and development and 
• continuing to aid agricultural development 
republicans know that a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world 
economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes 
it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform enhances the fight against corruption and reinforces the habits of liberty 
under republican leadership the united states has fostered an environment of economic openness to capitalize on our countrys greatest asset in the information age a vital innovative society that welcomes creative ideas and adapts to them 
american companies continue to show the world innovative ways to improve productivity and redraw traditional business models 
upon this extraordinary foundation president bush and the republican congress have rebuilt an effective american trade policy 
rooted in americas political and economic ideals the republican blueprint they have implemented promotes open markets and open societies free trade and the free flow of information and the development of new ideas and private sectors 
this selfsustaining economic and commercial progress has nurtured the human spirit the middle class law and liberty 
republicans applaud the renewal of the executivecongressional partnership on trade matters under republican leadership 
after a gap of eight years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for free and fair trade by passing trade promotion authority and the other marketopening measures for developing countries in the trade act of 
we commend the strong record of president bush and the republican congress in using their authority to promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond americas shores especially through free trade initiatives 
we support the administrations comprehensive strategy to promote free trade exemplified by the launch of the doha negotiation of the world trade organization wto regional and subregional initiatives such as the central american free trade agreement the free trade area of the americas and the middle east free trade area extension of the african growth and opportunity act and the conclusion of bilateral free trade agreements with nations such as australia morocco chile and singapore 
•completing agreements with countries and currently negotiating with other nations to reduce trade barriers together these nations represent americas third largest export market with economies totaling trillion in purchasing power 
•enforcing trade agreements and laws against unfair practices including staunch opposition to regulations that impede farm exports and improved agriculture 
• opposing unfair manipulation of currency rates by us trading partners and 
•taking timely action to help domestic industries and workers adjust to foreign competition including through safeguard actions in support of americas manufacturing sector and trade adjustment assistance for workers 
• incorporating appropriate labor and environmental concerns into us trade negotiations promoting mutually supportive trade and environmental policies and agreements and 
•using the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade 
we recognize that there is a fundamental connection between trade and development 
trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries 
we therefore welcome the republicanled reauthorization in the trade act of of preference programs with the nations of the caribbean and andean regions 
we affirm americas role in leading the world toward greater freedom opportunity and prosperity 
our efforts to expand the reach of economic and political freedom are complemented by our work in fostering religious liberty 
republicans will continue to make the protection and promotion of religious freedom abroad a cardinal principle of our foreign policy 
this reflects our national values and protects our national interests and renders our actions in the world consistent with our ideals as a people 
america is a working example of religious liberty home to millions of christians jews muslims and people of many other faiths who live in harmony and contribute to our culture 
in the presidents words it is not an accident that freedom of religion is one of the central freedoms in our bill of rights 
it is the first freedom of the human soul… 
we must stand for that freedom in our country 
we must speak for that freedom in the world ” 
we applaud president bushs record of accomplishment in broadening the realm of liberty and promoting prosperity and opportunity in the world and we endorse his vision for the future 
republicans are guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone 
in addition to nato the organization of american states and other longstanding alliances the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations and the world trade organization 
while international organizations can serve the cause of peace republicans believe they can never serve as a substitute for or exercise a veto over principled american leadership 
the united nations was not designed to summon or lead armies in the field and as a matter of us sovereignty american troops must never serve under united nations command 
the united nations can provide a valuable forum for nations to peacefully resolve their differences and it can help monitor international agreements and organize international humanitarian assistance 
under republican leadership the united states will pay a fair not disproportionate share of dues to the united nations which must continue to reform its management and take steps to eliminate waste fraud and abuse 
all funds that the us contributes for operations conferences and peacekeeping should count against these dues 
we hail the actions of president bush and the republican congress to ensure that our nations efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans arenot impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court whose jurisdiction we do not accept as extending to americans 
we support full implementation of the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of us personnel and officials 
we applaud president bush and the republican congress for working to end the unacceptable discrimination against israel at the united nations by that institutions denying committee assignments to israel 
we welcome israels membership in the western european and others group at the united nations headquarters and urge its full acceptance at other united nations venues 
we support adoption of bipartisan legislation to withhold the annual headquarters contribution made by the us department of state to the international committee of the red cross if magen david adom is not given the opportunity to participate fully in the activities of the international red cross and red crescent movement 
republicans continue to oppose the ideological campaign against participation by the vatican in united nations conferences and other activities 
the united nations was created to benefit all peoples and nations not to promote a radical agenda of social engineering 
any effort to address global social problems must be firmly placed within a context of respect for the fundamental social institutions of marriage and family 
we reject any treaty or convention that would contradict these values 
for that reason we support protecting the rights of families in international programs and oppose funding organizations involved in abortion 
republicans support the leadership of president bush and vice president cheney in speaking out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom 
worldwide at least to human beings are trafficked across international borders each year 
of those it is believed that more than percent are women and girls and that percent of them were forced into sexual servitude 
we applaud the president for his efforts to rally the international community including at the united nations in combating human trafficking for his call to the nations of the world to pass laws criminalizing these abhorrent practices and for working with republicans in congress to provide the funds necessary to combat trafficking on the international level 
we also praise president bush for his efforts at home where he has tripled the number of traffickers criminally charged and doubled the number of convictions while supporting the good work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation 
republicans believe that sound american foreign policy starts in our own neighborhood 
family and faith culture and commerce are enduring bonds among all the peoples of the americas 
our nations future is fundamentally linked to our neighbors in the western hemisphere 
republicans share president bushs vision of the americas as a fully democratic hemisphere working together to achieve representative democracy security and marketbased development 
we also applaud his proven track record in advancing trade liberalization in the americas in order to promote economic development and democratic governance 
we praise president bushs strong record of serious and sustained attention to the american neighborhood and coalitionbuilding with countries such as mexico canada brazil chile and colombia that share our democratic priorities 
under president bushs leadership the united states and mexico have developed a historic level of trust and mutual respect 
strengthened by common values and purposes this relationship has provided an unprecedented degree of bilateral cooperation 
republicans believe that it is a high national priority for america to continue building on that cooperation with mexico over the coming years to ensure safe orderly and legal migration flows further reduce the cost of remittances expand access to credit for small business entrepreneurs and further strengthen bilateral ties in education civil society housing agriculture infrastructure communications and information technologies 
republicans also recognize that as a respected voice in the region mexico will continue to be a vital partner in supporting democracy throughout the hemisphere as demonstrated by mexicos contributions to regional and multilateral approaches in bolivia and venezuela 
since the tragic events of september the united states has received excellent cooperation from our hemispheric partners to combat terror in north america

these initiatives complement the goal of achieving a genuine comprehensive free trade area in the hemisphere 
as republicans we believe that the free trade area of the americas is the best route to achieving that goal 
our party believes that the united states must continue to support the democracies of south america with strong economic and security assistance 
we therefore endorse the increased support that the president and the republican congress have provided to colombia in the fight against narcoterrorists in the eradication of coca and poppy crops and in the interdiction of illicit drugs and the extradition of criminals 
we also support the bush administrations active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of illegal drugs

republicans support the bush administrations efforts to achieve a peaceful democratic constitutional and electoral solution to venezuelas political crisis 
the castro regime is an anachronism in a region where democracy and open markets prevail 
the current political and economic crisis in cuba reflects four decades of castros failed policies 
the cuban government rightfully remains on the state departments terrorist list due to its continued support for terrorism including the harboring of fugitives from justice wanted in the united states for terrorismrelated offenses 
the castro regime continues to pursue policies of marxistleninist dictatorship police state tactics and total economic control 
because of these policies the castro regime remains hostile to americas interests and values 
as republicans we support president bushs principled position that the current embargo on trade with and restrictions on travel to cuba must remain in place as along as the cuban government refuses to hold free and fair elections ease its stranglehold on private enterprise and allow the cuban people to organize assemble and speak freely 
republicans understand that the castro regime will not change by its own choice 
but cuba must change

•public diplomacy efforts to disseminate information abroad about castros record of abusing human rights harboring terrorists committing espionage against other countries and fomenting subversion of democratically elected governments in latin america

•denying resources and legitimacy to the castro regime by eliminating abuses of educational travel programs 
•countering the regimes manipulation of our humanitarian policies by limiting recipients of remittances and gift parcels to immediate family members and

yet those institutions and values are threatened in some parts of africa by terrorism chaos and civil war 
to extend liberty in africa we must help african leaders who seek to achieve security and peace on the continent

brutal militias there are causing human suffering on an immense scale 
american assistance has been provided for famine relief assistance for refugees and other humanitarian aid

the government of sudan must stop the violence of janjaweed militias and all parties must respect the ceasefire and allow the free movement of humanitarian workers and supplies 
we continue to hope for peace for the people of sudan and for normalization of relations between sudan and the united states 
however the government of sudan must not remain complicit in the brutalization of darfur

republicans hail the signing into law of the us australia free trade agreement and look forward to building on more than years of alliance cooperation to resolve regional and global problems 
american ties to the philippines have been close for more than a hundred years 
we republicans have supported the victory of filipino democracy and cherish our continuing friendship with this great nation and its people who have been by our side in war and in peace 
under president bushs leadership the united states has undertaken an historic transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based upon his conviction that us interests require a strong relationship between the worlds largest democracies 
since the united states has started with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common security interests and a shared fundamental commitment to political freedom and representative government 
through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future 
the prospects for that partnership were further enhanced by the announcement this january of the next steps in strategic partnership between the united states and india a new effort to further deepen and accelerate cooperation between our two nations 
republicans applaud indias move toward greater economic freedom 
we hold a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean 
bilateral trade between the us and india increased from billion in to nearly billion in with us exports to india increasing by percent the largest increase ever 
finally we share the commitment to fighting terrorism and creating a strategically stable asia 
republicans support president bushs view that america must maintain forces in the asiapacific region that reflect our commitments to our allies our security requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment 
america will also build on stability provided by our asian alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to advance progress and deepen our ties to the peoples of this region 
republicans applaud president bush for his leadership in dramatically refashioning americas relationship with pakistan 
the united states and pakistan are working closely in the fight against terror 
we endorse continued american support for pakistans security economic and social programs 
republicans believe that americas relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asiapacific region 
we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china 
the democratic development of china is crucial to that future 
yet a quartercentury after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy chinas leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state 
in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness 
in time china will find that social and political freedoms are the only source of that greatness 
under president bushs leadership the united states has sought a constructive relationship with a changing china 
our two nations have cooperated well where our interests overlap including the current war on terror and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula 
likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism 
shared health and environmental threats such as the threat of hivaids sars and other infectious diseases challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens 
addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society enhance individual human rights and end suppression of the media 
to make that nation accountable to its citizens needs and aspirations much work remains to be done 
only by allowing the chinese people to think speak assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential 
china has discovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth 
chinas leaders will also discover that freedom is indivisible that social and religious freedoms are also essential to national greatness and national dignity 
eventually men and women who are allowed to control their own wealth will insist on controlling their own lives and their own country 
our important bilateral trade relationship has benefited from chinas entry into the world trade organization creating export opportunities and jobs for american farmers workers and companies 
the power of market principles and the wtos requirements for transparency and accountability have bolstered openness and the rule of law in china 
republicans support the commitment of president bush and republicans in congress to ensure that china fulfills its wto obligations 
there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements including human rights chinas observance of its nonproliferation commitments and americas commitment to the selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act 
we support president bushs efforts to narrow differences where they exist but not to allow them to preclude cooperation where there is agreement 
the united states governments policy is that there is one china as reflected in the three communiqués and the taiwan relations act 
america opposes any unilateral decision by either china or taiwan to change the status quo 
republicans recognize that americas policy is based on the principle that there must be no use of force by china against taiwan 
we deny the right of beijing to impose its rule on the free taiwanese people 
all issues regarding taiwans future must be resolved peacefully and must be agreeable to the people of taiwan 
if china violates these principles and attacks taiwan then the united states will respond appropriately in accordance with the taiwan relations act 
america will help taiwan defend itself 
republicans applaud president bush and the republican congress for honoring our nations promises to the people of taiwan a longstanding friend of the united states and a genuine democracy 
taiwan deserves americas strong support including the timely sale of defensive arms to enhance taiwans security 
in recognition of its growing importance in the global economy republicans applaud taiwans membership in the world trade organization and support its participation in the world health organization and other multilateral institutions 
americas relations with vietnam are still overshadowed by two grave concerns 
the first is uncertainty concerning the americans who became prisoners of war or were missing in action 
republicans commend president bush for enhancing efforts to obtain the fullest possible accounting for those still missing and for the repatriation of the remains of those who died in the cause of freedom 
the second is continued retribution by the government of vietnam against its ethnic minorities and others who fought alongside our forces there 
the united states owes those individuals a debt of honor and will not be blind to their suffering 
the republican party is committed to democracy in burma and to nobel laureate aung san suu kyi and other democratic leaders whose election in was brutally suppressed and who have been arrested and imprisoned for their belief in freedom and democracy 
republicans share with her the view that the basic principles of human freedom and dignity are universal 
we are committed to working with our allies in europe and asia to maintain a firm and resolute opposition to the military junta in rangoon 
because of the strategic location and historical ties of the pacific island nations to the united states republicans will continue to work closely with the countries of this region on a wide variety of issues of common concern 
republicans applaud president bush for the visionary agenda he set forth at the beginning of his administration the establishment of a europe whole free and at peace 
that agenda is in the finest tradition of americas historical commitment to the freedom and security of europe 
it builds on the legacy of the courageous and resolute leadership of presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush through which the cold war was won 
we hail the presidents success in achieving unprecedented cooperation with europe at nato through the european union and with individual nations in combating terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction building peace and democracy in afghanistan and iraq and advancing the cause of freedom democracy and opportunity throughout the broader middle east and north africa 
in particular we are grateful for the close friendship and strong partnership with the united kingdom upholding the tradition of a special relationship between our two nations 
together and with strong us leadership america and europe are decisively confronting the greatest challenges and boldly seizing the historic opportunities of our time 
we believe that the security of the united states is inseparable from the security of europe 
this enduring truth was reaffirmed by our european allies after the attacks of september when nato invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the first time in the history of the alliance recognizing that the attack on america was also an attack on the alliance as a whole 
republicans know that a strong nato is the foundation of peace in europe and beyond 
we commend natos leadership of the international security assistance force in afghanistan a mission that has been led in the past by the united kingdom turkey germany and the netherlands and is being supported by european partners such as ireland albania and croatia 
we applaud the establishment of a nato operation to train iraqi security forces 
we hail those nato nations and nato partners that are contributing forces to iraq including the polishled division for which the alliance has provided technical support 
republicans remain steadfast supporters of nato enlargement 
we recall that the leadership of a republican senate helped poland the czech republic and hungary return to the euroatlantic community through membership in the alliance 
we hail the presidents leadership in natos decision to welcome seven new democracies into the alliance this year bulgaria estonia latvia lithuania romania slovakia and slovenia 
republicans support the continued enlargement of nato to include other democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests 
republicans recognize and applaud the fact that especially since september some of americas strongest allies and friends have been the democracies of central and eastern europe many of whom inspired the world during the cold war by assaulting the iron curtain again and again until it finally crashed down forever 
republicans hail the participation in the multinational coalition in iraq of nato members that joined the alliance in and poland hungary the czech republic bulgaria estonia latvia lithuania romania and slovakia as well as the contributions of ukraine georgia moldova albania and macedonia 
through their dedication to the cause of security and freedom in iraq these nations together with the united kingdom italy the netherlands denmark portugal and norway are demonstrating their commitment to the values shared by members of the transatlantic community 
we also applaud the contribution of forces in iraq by azerbaijan and kazakhstan and support strengthening natos partnerships with these nations and their neighbors in the caucasus and central asia 
president bush is forging a new relationship with russia based on the central reality that the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries 
we hail the presidents visionary leadership in reassessing the antiballistic missile treaty which was a relic of the cold war and treated russia as an enemy 
the president has strengthened this new relationship by concluding the historic moscow treaty on strategic reductions which will reduce the nuclear arsenals of our two nations to their lowest levels in decades 
president bush is rightly refocusing the relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges especially broadening our already extensive cooperation in the war on terror and promoting beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations 
at the same time republicans believe that russias uneven commitment to the basic values of democracy remains a matter of great concern 
we continue to support the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russias integration into the euroatlantic community 
republicans recognize and hail president bushs use of the prestige and influence of the united states to support the efforts of leaders in ireland and the united kingdom and the many other people of goodwill who are working to achieve a lasting and peaceful settlement in northern ireland 
we endorse president bushs personal reaffirmation of americas commitment to the good friday agreement and to its full and complete implementation as expressed during his visit to northern ireland in april 
we applaud the presidents appointment of a special envoy for northern ireland who is participating in the peace process and supporting efforts of ireland and the united kingdom to restore the democratic process in northern ireland 
we share the presidents commitment that americas support for this vital work will continue 
republicans support americas commitment to northern irelands economic development including our nations contributions to the international fund for ireland and private us investment in the north with care to ensure fair employment and better opportunities for all 
though the burdens of history weigh heavily upon that land we cheer its people for taking the lead in building for themselves and for their children a future of peace and understanding 
our party continues to support a peaceful settlement for cyprus and respect by all parties for the wishes of the cypriot people 
a fair and lasting cyprus settlement will benefit the people of cyprus as well as serve the interests of america and our allies greece and turkey 
republicans share president bushs understanding that just as events in europe determined the outcome of the cold war events in the broader middle east will set the course for the victory of free nations in the war on terror 
it is important to reaffirm that the war we wage against terrorists is not a battle of faiths 
as the home to millions of muslim believers america welcomes the valuable role of muslim leaders in promoting peace 
we recognize that acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the islamic faith 
we know that in this struggle against terrorism free nations have strong allies of every faith including millions of people in the middle east who want to live in freedom 
as republicans we share the presidents conviction that if that region grows in democracy prosperity and hope the terrorist movement will lose its sponsors lose its recruits and lose the festering grievances that keep terrorists in business 
we affirm our support for president bushs forward strategy of freedom in the middle east as well as the broader middle east and north africa initiative adopted at the g summit this year 
republicans support efforts by the president vice president and republican congress to ensure that america takes the side of reformers who are committed to democratic change 
we support doubling the budget for the national endowment for democracy and focusing its new work on bringing free elections free markets free speech and free labor unions to the middle east 
we support the presidents expansion of americas public diplomacy efforts including the use of radio and television to broadcast uncensored information and a message of tolerance in arabic and persian to tens of millions of people 
we applaud the commitment represented by the presidents middle east partnership initiative which funds economic political and educational reform efforts in the middle east and champions opportunity for all people of the region especially women and youth 
we are pleased that the momentum of freedom in the middle east is beginning to benefit women 
in afghanistan women are preparing to vote in free elections having participated in the drafting of a new constitution and taken on key responsibilities in a liberated nation 
under the ruthless grip of the taliban regime afghan girls were barred from getting an education and women were banned from holding jobs and were publicly whipped when they did not follow the talibans rules 
afghanistans new constitution affords equal rights to all afghan citizens and afghan women are now being integrated into the economic social and political life of their liberated country 
in iraq the systematic use of rape by saddam husseins regime to dishonor families has ended and the countrys interim constitution guarantees all iraqis the right to vote and makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender ethnicity or religion 
as a fundamental element of the presidents strategy republicans support the expansion of economic opportunities for the peoples of the middle east including through free trade 
we applaud the enactment of free trade agreements with jordan and morocco and the completion of negotiations toward such an agreement with bahrain 
we support the presidents goal of a middle east free trade area by and highlight the conclusion of trade and investment framework agreements with saudi arabia kuwait qatar the united arab emirates oman and tunisia among others 
republicans endorse continued assistance and support for countries that have made peace with israel led by egypt and jordan 
we applaud the actions of president bush and the republican congress to provide both nations with new grants and loan guarantees to promote economic reform measures 
the republican party shares president bushs commitment to the security of americas democratic ally israel and the safety of the israeli people 
we remain committed to ensuring that israel maintains a qualitative edge in defensive technology over any potential adversaries 
we believe that terror attacks against israelis are part of the same evil as the september attacks against america 
we recognize israels right to defend itself in the face of homicide bombings and other attacks against the people of israel 
we are very concerned about the escalation of antisemitic violence worldwide including in europe 
this violence has included physical assaults use of weapons arson of synagogues and desecration of jewish cemeteries and statues 
we are proud of president bushs outspoken condemnation of antisemitism 
we share his conviction that antisemitism poisons public debates within democratic nations and that mankind must come together to fight such dark impulses 
we support president bushs vision of two states israel and palestine living side by side in peace and security 
however as he observed in his remarks of june for such a vision to become a reality palestinians need a new leadership not compromised by terror 
like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices 
if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state 
the bush administration has been clear about the obligations of arab nations in achieving peace in the middle east 
republicans agree with president bush that israels plan to remove all settlements from gaza and several settlements from the west bank is a courageous step toward peace in the face of continuing terrorist violence 
this initiative can stimulate progress toward peace as laid out in the road map launched by president bush 
republicans commend the government of israel for its desire to pursue peace even in the face of continuing terrorist attacks 
this is demonstrated by steps israel has taken such as removing unauthorized outposts and improving the humanitarian situation by easing restrictions on the movement of palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities 
republicans agree with president bushs assessment that an agreed just fair and realistic framework for a solution to the palestinian refugee issue as part of any final status agreement will need to be found through the establishment of a palestinian state and the settling of palestinian refugees there rather than in israel 
we also share the presidents view that as part of a final peace settlement it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 
all previous efforts to negotiate a twostate solution have reached the same conclusion 
it is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities 
republicans continue to support moving the us embassy from tel aviv to israels capital jerusalem 
in iran we continue to see a government that represses its people pursues weapons of mass destruction and supports terror 
we also see iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty human rights and democracy 
the iranian people have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny 
we applaud president bushs leadership in ensuring them that the united states supports their aspirations to live in freedom including by broadcasting uncensored information to the iranian people nearly hours a day 
we also support the presidents practice of forming policy toward iran based on iranian actions not words and applaud his administrations progress in convincing americas friends and allies most importantly in europe to join us in a firm common approach to ending irans nuclear weapons programs 
under president bushs leadership the united states and our european allies are speaking as plainly as possible to the iranians making it absolutely clear that the development of a nuclear weapon in iran is intolerable to the international community 
ownership gives citizens a vital stake in their communities and their country 
by expanding ownership we will help turn economic growth into lasting prosperity 
as republicans we trust people to make decisions about how to spend save and invest their own money 
we want individuals to own and control their income 
we want people to have a tangible asset that they can build and rely on making their own choices and directing their own future 
ownership should not be the preserve of the wealthy or the privileged 
as republicans who believe in the power of ownership to create better lives we want more people to own a home 
we want more people to own and build small businesses 
we want more people to own and control their health care 
we want more people to own personal retirement accounts 
with president bushs leadership we have taken great strides in making the dream of ownership available to millions of americans and in the next four years the president and republicans in congress will unlock the door to ownership for many more 
george w bush ran for president on a promise of lower taxes so that people could keep more of the income they earn 
he fulfilled that pledge 
the fundamental premise of tax relief is that everyone who pays income taxes should see their income taxes reduced 
the president offered a plan to lower all tax rates 
republicans in congress strongly supported the presidents plan 
in president bush signed historic tax relief into law 
this year million families with children are receiving an average tax cut of over 
• created a new low percent income tax bracket 
• lowered individual income tax rates for all americans who pay income taxes 
• doubled the child tax credit to 
• reduced the marriage penalty for million married couples 
•expanded education iras made prepaid tuition plans taxfree and created a deduction for higher education expenses 
• phasedout the death tax that penalizes familyowned small businesses and farms 
•simplified and expanded iras and ks so workers can save more for their retirement and 
• increased the adoption tax credit and the child care tax credit 
president bush and the republican congress built on the reforms of by passing the jobs and growth act of 
this legislation assisted our economic recovery by accelerating the tax relief and encouraging investment 
the tax rates on capital gains and dividend income were reduced to the same lower rate of percent to encourage saving and investment 
seven million senior citizens who rely on dividend income are benefiting from this tax relief 
the law also quadrupled small business expensing so entrepreneurs can deduct from their taxes the first of investment 
because of the and tax cuts million families are receiving an average tax cut of over and the overall tax burden on working americans is the lowest it has been in years 
we believe that good government is based on a system of limited taxes and spending 
furthermore we believe that the federal government should be limited and restricted to the functions mandated by the united states constitution 
the taxation system should not be used to redistribute wealth or fund everincreasing entitlements and social programs 
many democrats however believe the government has a right to claim the money earned by working americans 
they fight any attempt to return the balance of power from washington to individual families and businesses 
furthermore the slim majority held by republicans in the senate and the rules of the senate make it difficult to pass permanent tax relief 
all of the tax relief provided over the last four years will be eliminated in the next six years if congress does not take action to make the relief permanent 
our party endorses the presidents proposals to make tax relief permanent so that families and businesses can plan for the future with confidence 
anything less will result in a significant tax increase on americans 
making the tax cuts permanent is a crucial first step toward expanding ownership and ensuring that america turns economic growth into lasting prosperity 
the only way to accomplish this goal is to elect a solid republican majority to both houses of congress 
we look forward to a new congress with larger republican majorities working with president bush to ensure that taxes do not go back up on american families 
more than half of all americans save and invest in private markets 
we want even more people to build assets that they own and can use to meet a variety of needs over the course of their lives 
in the past few years president bush and congressional republicans have passed into law a variety of measures to improve simplify expand and protect retirement savings in iras ks and other retirement plans 
• increased the amount you can save each year taxfree 
• made it easier to take your retirement plan from one job to the next 
•allowed women who take time off from work to start a family to catch up on their missed retirement plan contributions 
•required more disclosure for employer sponsored retirement plans and required that rules apply to both executives and rankandfile employees 
republicans will not rest on this success 
we will build upon it by promoting policies that encourage workers to save 
we support the presidents proposal to create a new lifetime savings account lsa so workers can save for a variety of needs to consolidate the three types of current law iras into a single retirement savings account rsa and to consolidate numerous employerbased retirement plans into a single employer retirement savings account ersa 
these account options will promote personal saving which opens up more opportunities for the saver and increases private capital that is available to entrepreneurs for investing growing the economy and creating jobs 
social security needs to be strengthened and enhanced for our children and grandchildren 
•anyone now receiving social security or close to being eligible for it is guaranteed that their benefits will not be cut and their taxes will not be raised 
social security is a promise made by this country to its citizens and republicans will keep that promise 
•key changes to social security should merit bipartisan agreement so all improvements are a win for the american people rather than a political victory for any one party 
•personal retirement accounts must be the cornerstone of strengthening and enhancing social security 
each of todays workers should be free to direct a portion of their payroll taxes to personal investments for their retirement 
it is crucial that individuals be offered a variety of investment alternatives and that detailed information be provided to each participant to help them judge the risks and benefits of each plan 
todays financial markets offer a variety of investment options including some that guarantee a rate of return higher than the current social security system with no risk to the investor 
• young people deserve to know their social security will in fact be there when they retire just as we have guaranteed it to their grandparents and parents today 
this new generation of american workers deserves to have ownership of their future 
they must have choices 
•assets in personal accounts should belong to each individual 
every american should have the opportunity to build a nest egg for the future and pass along that money to their children or grandchildren who could use the funds to pay for college buy a home start a small business or begin saving for their own retirement 
•choice is the key 
any new options for retirement security should be voluntary so workers can choose to remain in the current system or opt for something different 
this is a challenge that demands leadership 
president bush has shown this leadership by proposing a bold alternative to the collapse of social security 
along with americans everywhere we pledge to join him in this endeavor of a lifetime 
individual ownership of voluntary personal retirement accounts for todays workers will make social security more equitable but just as importantly will put the system on sure financial footing 
fifty years ago there were workers to support every one beneficiary of social security 
today there are just workers for each beneficiary 
by the time young men and women who are entering the workforce today turn there will be only two workers for each beneficiary 
doing nothing is not an option 
we must keep faith with both the past and the future by strengthening and enhancing social security 
we believe that everyone who participates in the social security program should use legal and accurate identification 
president bush formed a bipartisan commission that recommended three models for reform and many republicans in congress have exhibited leadership in sponsoring six different bills 
nonpartisan analysis of these proposals shows that each strengthens social security and that each shares a common characteristic giving workers the option of supplementing social security with personal retirement accounts that they own 
our party supports the efforts of president bush and congressional republicans to enact legislation during the next term 
homeownership is central to the american dream and republicans want to make it a reality for everyone 
that starts with access to capital for entrepreneurs and access to credit for consumers 
both have improved immensely in the past four years resulting in record levels of homeownership 
for the first time more than half of all minorities own their home 
we support the presidents goal of increasing the number of minority homeowners by at least million families by the end of the decade 
since president bush announced his initiative in an additional million minorities have become homeowners 
the selfhelp homeownership opportunities program helps lowincome families purchase a home 
the most significant barrier to homeownership is the down payment 
we support efforts to reduce that barrier like the american dream downpayment act and zero downpayment mortgages 
the president and congress have taken action to provide counseling and education to help firsttime homebuyers navigate the process of buying a home 
the administration has also taken steps to alert people to the dangers of predatory lending in an effort to help americans maintain a positive credit history 
affordable housing is in the national interest 
that is why the mortgage interest deduction for primary residences was put into the federal tax code and why tax reform of any kind should continue to encourage homeownership 
we support efforts to enact the singlefamily affordable housing tax credit 
at the same time a balanced national housing policy must recognize that decent housing includes apartments and addresses the needs of all citizens including renters 
in many areas housing prices are higher than they need to be because of regulations that drive up building costs 
some regulation is of course necessary and so is sensible zoning 
we urge states and localities to work with local builders and lenders to eliminate unnecessary burdens that price many families out of the market 
we see no role for any federal regulation of homebuilding 
we do foresee a larger role for state and local governments in controlling the federally assisted housing that has been so poorly managed from washington 
we also encourage the modification of restrictions that inhibit the rehabilitation of existing distressed properties 
small businesses are the most potent force of economic growth and job creation in america 
they generate more than half of our nations gross domestic product and create seven out of ten new privatesector jobs in america 
small businesses have been the primary vehicles of economic advance for american women 
republicans pledged in to lower tax rates for small business owners and entrepreneurs end the death tax cut red tape reform our liability system and aggressively expand overseas markets for our goods and services 
though more work remains to be done including reauthorizing the small business administration president bush and congressional republicans have made good on each of those commitments 
•reduced taxes on million small business owners and entrepreneurs 
much of the tax relief came from reductions in individual income tax rates 
ninety percent of businesses pay income taxes at individual rates not corporate rates 
this includes hundreds of thousands of successful small business owners and entrepreneurs who pay taxes in the top tax rates and whose taxes would increase considerably under john kerrys economic plan 
• lowered the tax burden on investment in new equipment by quadrupling the limit on small business expensing from to and allowing additional firstyear depreciation of that equipment 
•phasedout the death tax that punishes familyowned small businesses and family farms 
•increased federal contracts to small businesses 
in small businesses received the largest percentage ever of all federal contracts 
in addition president bush developed a strategy to reverse the trend toward bundling of contracts a practice that has denied small businesses the ability to compete for billions of procurement dollars 
•reduced paperwork 
for example million small business taxpayers now have fewer lines to fill out on tax forms freeing up an estimated million hours previously used for paperwork every year 
• enacted health savings accounts which allow individuals to save and pay for their health care taxfree 
combined with a catastrophic health plan they are an easier and less costly way for small businesses to provide health insurance for their employees 
• enacted common sense liability protections in the terrorism risk insurance and safety acts 
•negotiated agreements to reduce trade barriers and expand access to foreign markets 
an area in special need of more work is liability reform 
frivolous lawsuits put more money in the pockets of trial lawyers and leave businesses with less money to create jobs 
they raise health care costs on small businesses often preventing them from offering health insurance to their employees 
we support efforts by president bush congressional republicans and republican governors to curb the burden of frivolous lawsuits 
we recognize that the democrats nominees one of whom made his fortune as a trial lawyer are beholden to the interests of the trial lawyer lobby and offer no hope for reform of this badly broken system 
health savings accounts allow people to own and control their health care 
they are an important step toward creating a system of consumerdriven health care that puts patients and doctors at the center of decisionmaking not government bureaucrats 
when consumers make decisions about health care individuals control their health care dollars and health care decisions 
health savings accounts allow people to save earn interest and spend tax free on their health care needs 
hsas are combined with a lowpremium highdeductible health insurance plan to offer flexible affordable insurance options for small businesses and individuals 
health savings accounts are now available to all americans thanks to the efforts of president bush and the republican congress 
the next step which our party endorses is to extend tax deductibility to the insurance premiums associated with hsas 
we also support efforts to expand the use of health savings accounts to help control health care costs and give individuals more power in making important medical decisions 
the core of ownership in america has always been ownership of private property that a citizen can call his or her own 
republicans respect this tradition 
for reasons both constitutional and environmental therefore president bush and the republican congress will safeguard private property rights by enforcing the takings clause of the fifth amendment and by providing just compensation whenever private property is needed to achieve a compelling public purpose 
we oppose efforts to diminish the rights of private citizens to the land they own 
americas economy is the strongest in the world and it is getting stronger thanks to lower taxes fewer burdensome regulations and a focus on encouraging investment 
our goal is to make sure america remains the strongest economy in a dynamic world and to make it possible for every american who wants a job to find one 
we must ensure that workers are equipped with the education and training to succeed in the best jobs of the st century and we must encourage the strong spirit of innovation that has put america at the forefront of new technology industries 
future prosperity demands that we have affordable cleaner more independent energy supplies and affordable highquality health care 
we must maintain our commitment to free and fair trade lower taxes limited regulation and a limited efficient government that keeps up with the new realities of a changing world 
by keeping the costs of running a business low and ensuring that our workers have the skills to compete in a dynamic global economy president bush and the republican congress will continue to ensure that america is the best nation in the world in which to create jobs 
in president bush and the republican congress worked together to pass the most sweeping tax relief in a generation 
by letting families workers and small business owners keep more of the money they earn they helped bring america from recession to a steadily expanding economy 
despite enduring the aftereffects of the stock markets irrational exuberance in the late s terrorist attacks on our nation and corporate scandals that bubbled to the surface after years of inattention the us economy has now grown for straight months 
and unlike four years ago there are no signs of an end to the current economic growth 
the proof is in the numbers and the numbers prove our economy is strong and growing stronger 
•over the past year gross domestic product gdp grew at one of the fastest rates in two decades 
•without the presidents tax relief real gdp would have been more than percent lower and million fewer americans would have been working at the end of last year 
• since last august million new jobs have been created 
•the unemployment rate has fallen from to percent which is below the average of the s s and s 
• employment over the last year is up in of the states and the unemployment rate is down in of the states 
in addition to the official figures household surveys show that hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created unreported through selfemployment and by small businesses 
• real aftertax incomes are up by percent since december 
•homeownership rates are at record levels seven out of ten american families own their own home today 
• consumer confidence is up from the levels seen at this time last year 
• inflation remains low by historical standards as do mortgage rates 
we know what brought us this success the hard work of the american people and the republican commitment to low taxes 
now we must keep our economy on the right path by preventing taxes on families from going up next year making the tax relief of the last four years permanent and reforming the tax code to make it simpler fairer and more growthoriented 
in we rightly declared the federal tax code is dysfunctional 
it penalizes hard work marriage thrift and success the very factors that are the foundations for lasting prosperity 
as noted earlier from reducing marginal income tax rates to phasing out the death tax president bush and the republican congress have made great strides in addressing each of these problems 
however it is equally obvious that much more remains to be done to reform the federal tax code 
instead of being simple the current tax system is needlessly complex making it susceptible to abusive tax avoidance schemes 
instead of being efficient it punishes hard work discourages savings and investment and hinders the international competitiveness of us firms 
instead of being fair it is out of line with our basic values and undermines our sense of fairness 
instead of being predictable it is highly unpredictable and uncertain 
tax reform is necessary to achieve the simplicity efficiency fairness and predictability that the american people deserve and to give all americans the freedom to determine their own spending priorities 
•make the tax relief of and permanent 
the various expiring tax relief provisions ranging from to make the tax code confusing for everybody and limits the ability of workers families and businesses to plan for the future with confidence 
nowhere is this more apparent than with the death tax which is reduced now disappears in and then comes fully back to life in 
• build on efforts to develop a tax code that does not punish taxpayers for saving 
• replace the tax code with a system that is simpler provides more freedom to our citizens is progrowth boosts the economy and encourages savings and investment 
a code that provides several definitions of a child is a code that needs to be reformed 
we support legislation requiring a supermajority vote in both houses of congress to raise taxes 
we oppose all attempts by the united nations to impose a global tax and reject any claims of authority by united nations to do so 
because of the vital role of religious and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering charity and patriotism they should not be subject to taxation 
the alternative minimum tax amt represents a second tax system for individuals 
its stated goal is to insure that highincome taxpayers pay some amount of income tax 
but due to the lack of indexing the broad base and reach of the current amt will make it apply increasingly to middleincome taxpayers 
millions of additional taxpayers must complete amt forms just to determine that they are not subject to the tax 
as we look at the broader issue of tax reform we call upon congress to address this increasingly unfair second tax system on hardworking americans 
to make sure the private sector has the capital it needs to invest grow the economy and expand prosperity our leaders must make sure that the growth of the federal government remains in check 
the challenges america has faced over the last four years have created an unwelcome but manageable budget deficit 
these deficits are due to a number of factors the stock market downturn that began in and the subsequent recession that president bush inherited when he took office the terrorist attacks on america and the necessary spending for homeland security and the war on terror those attacks precipitated and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals that were years in the making 
it is important to view the size of the deficit in relation to the size of the nations economy 
by that measure todays deficit although unwelcome is well within historical ranges 
a deficit that is percent of gdp as is now projected for this year would be smaller than the deficits in nine of the last years and far below the peak deficit figure of percent of gdp reached in 
this deficit is also in line with what other industrialized nations are facing today 
the u s deficit matches the average deficit within the organization for economic cooperation and development and is below the levels of france germany and japan 
much more importantly because the president and congress enacted progrowth economic policies the deficit is headed strongly in the right direction 
next years projected deficit at percent of gdp would be smaller than those in of the last years 
as republicans in congress work with the president to restrain spending and strengthen economic growth the federal deficit will fall to percent of the nations economic output in well below the percent average of the last years 
the events that brought us into deficit are not completely behind us 
the war on terror goes on 
the recession has passed but some industries and workers are still feeling its effects 
republicans are committed to winning the war on terror and will continue to implement policies that promote jobs investment and growth in every region of the country and every sector of our economy 
let us be clear if government is to meet the most pressing needs of our time and still maintain fiscal discipline government leaders must set priorities and stick with them 
president bush has shown genuine leadership in doing just that 
time and again he has made difficult decisions and followed through with clear determination 
he has made it plain that his top budgetary priority is to protect america and win the war on terror 
he also remains committed to the education reforms he spearheaded in 
all discretionary spending must be kept in check and taxes must remain low to stimulate economic growth 
we endorse the presidents progrowth economic policies and his disciplined approach to spending taxpayers dollars 
and we applaud the efforts of president bush and republicans in congress to meet our nations priorities and cut the deficit by more than half within five years 
tax cuts and spending are not the same 
they do not have the same effect on the economy or on the federal budget 
tax cuts allow american workers families business owners and investors to keep more of their own money 
new spending requires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the economy 
we recognize that the problem is not that the american people are taxed too little but that the federal government spends too much 
to ensure that the federal government respects the burdens on taxpayers and spends only as much as is necessary to accomplish our common goals we support extending the payasyougo requirement for mandatory spending only 
spending limits will help congress restrain the growth of government 
we support a cap on discretionary spending that will limit the growth of overall spending while ensuring that priorities such as our nations security will continue to be met 
we applaud president bush for submitting a budget for that provides significant increases in funding to win the war on terror and protect the homeland while limiting the growth in all other nonsecurity related discretionary spending to less than one percent 
to further the goal of respecting taxpayers dollars and restraining spending we endorse the creation of a lineitem veto which the president could use consistent with the constitution to reject new appropriations new mandatory spending or limited grants of tax benefits to or fewer beneficiaries whenever he determines the spending or tax benefits are not essential priorities 
under this approach all savings from the lineitem veto would be used for deficit reduction and could not be applied to other spending 
governors across the nation already have and use this tool to reduce unnecessary spending 
the president should have the same option 
it is often said that a government program is the closest man has come to achieving immortality 
government programs are designed with specific purposes and they ought to be assessed to determine whether they are meeting their goals 
we endorse creating a commission to evaluate discretionary spending on federal agencies and programs to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used for the best most efficient purposes 
such a commission would determine whether certain programs are duplicative wasteful or inefficient outdated or irrelevant or failed 
it would recommend to congress programs that could be terminated moved or restructured to make the government more efficient 
new government programs are frequently created with little review of programs that already exist to address the same perceived problem 
over time numerous programs with overlapping missions and competing agendas grow up alongside one another wasting money and baffling citizens 
we support president bushs vision for government reform which is guided by three principles 
government should be citizencentered not bureaucracycentered resultsoriented and marketbased actively promoting rather than stifling innovation through competition 
the presidents management agenda is an effective tool for making sure government is active but limited focusing on results and obtaining them efficiently 
the republican party respects and appreciates the private sector as the primary creator of jobs economic growth opportunity and prosperity in our society 
the private sector functions most effectively when laws are transparent and people respect them this includes people in positions of power 
when corporate leaders break the law they should be punished 
after fraudulent corporate practices rooted in the irrational exuberance of the late s began to surface in the closing months of president bush worked with the congress to take decisive action to restore honesty and integrity to americas corporate boardrooms 
in july president bush signed the sarbanesoxley act the most farreaching reform of american business practices since the s 
under this new law ceos and chief financial officers are required to personally vouch for the truth and fairness of their companies disclosures for the first time an independent board has been established to oversee the accounting profession investigators have been given new tools to root out corporate fraud and enhanced penalties are ensuring that dishonest corporate officials do hard time 
we applaud president bush for vigorously enforcing the law to deter and punish further corporate abuses 
he established an interagency corporate fraud task force to investigate and prosecute financial crimes to recover the proceeds of those crimes and to hold corporate criminals to account 
since the task force was established two years ago over violators have been charged and over convictions or guilty pleas secured including more than former ceos 
more than billion in forfeited funds has also been recovered from corporate wrongdoers for return to defrauded creditors and investors 
separately the enforcement budget of the securities and exchange commission sec has more than doubled and the sec has issued new rules to ban latetrading and other fraudulent practices engaged in by certain mutual funds 
thanks to swift and decisive action by president bush and the congress americans can trust that corporate executives who operate outside the law will be prosecuted 
international trade has become the worlds most powerful economic force and americans are seeing great benefits from free and fair trade 
exports accounted for about percent of the economic growth in the s and supported about million jobs 
an additional million jobs are made possible by companies based in foreign countries investing here in the united states 
consumers have benefited recent trade agreements save the average family of four per year by lowering regulatory barriers eliminating tariffs and providing more consumer choices 
free trade must be fair trade that advances americas economic goals and protects american jobs 
to achieve this goal we must act globally regionally and bilaterally to negotiate new trade agreements and enforce existing trade commitments 
we must be at the table when trade agreements are negotiated make the interests of american workers and farmers paramount and ensure that the drive to open new markets is successful 
we reject moves toward economic isolationism 
america is the best place in the world to do business and our workers and products are the best in the world 
on a level playing field we can outmatch any other nation 
we applaud the presidents actions to open foreign markets to american manufacturing products agricultural goods services and intellectual property while ensuring enforcement of trade agreements so that other nations live up to their promises 
in we resolved to renew trade promotion authority so the president could more easily negotiate trade agreements 
in president bush and republicans in congress did exactly that 
after lapsing for eight years the law now allows president bush to work with other countries to reduce barriers to our products and services 
• the bush administration has negotiated trade agreements with countries 
• they have made progress on agreements with another countries 
•these free trade partners represent trillion in purchasing power the equivalent of americas thirdlargest export market 
•the agreements include high levels of protection and strong enforcement measures for intellectual property 
•the administration has also made significant progress in negotiating multilateral trade agreements having just last month revived world trade organization wto negotiations for the final phase of the doha round 
• the revival of these negotiations opens the door to lower tariffs on consumer and industrial goods reductions in tariffs and tradedistorting export subsidies on agricultural products and market access and lower regulatory barriers for services 
the vitality of the us trade agenda depends upon the vigorous enforcement of us trade laws against unfair competition 
we will not tolerate foreign practices rules and subsidization that put our exports and manufacturers on an unequal footing 
it is not enough to secure signatures on a piece of paper our trading partners must follow through on the promises they make 
as part of its trade enforcement efforts the bush administration has imposed more antidumping orders on average each year than the previous administration 
the united states was the first country in the world to impose a safeguard action against chinese textile and apparel imports and to file a case against china in the wto 
china settled that case agreeing to repeal its subsidy of semiconductors that was penalizing us manufacturers 
also this year through bilateral consultations with china the united states resolved seven other potential trade disputes over high technology products agriculture and intellectual property protection 
we strongly endorse the bush administrations unprecedented effort to persuade and encourage china to desist in its policy of manipulating its currency to give chinese manufacturers an artificial advantage in global markets 
americas litigation system is broken 
junk and frivolous lawsuits are driving up the cost of doing business in america by forcing companies to pay excessive legal expenses to fight off or settle often baseless lawsuits 
those costs are being paid by small business owners manufacturers their employees and consumers 
a typical small business with million in annual revenue pays about a year in tort liability costs 
that is money that could be used to invest and hire new employees 
inefficiency and waste in the legal system is costing the average american family of four every year equivalent to an extra percent tax on wages 
and the bulk of jury awards to plaintiffs dont even go to the people who deserve it 
injured persons on average collect less than cents of every dollar that the legal system costs 
trial lawyers get rich from the misfortune of others 
if small business is americas economic engine trial lawyers are the brakes they cost hundreds of thousands of good jobs drive honest employers out of business deprive women of critical medical care then skip out with fat wallets and nary a thought for the economic havoc and human misery they leave in their wake 
we praise president bush and republicans in congress for their efforts to reform the legal system by passing meaningful class action reform asbestos reform and medical liability reform 
and we call to account senate democrats and the powerful trial lawyer lobby who have shown no shame in utilizing obstructionist tactics to thwart the efforts of majorities in congress to provide meaningful relief to all americans 
the republican party reaffirms its support for meaningful reform of the legal system and will continue its fight to guarantee the rights of all plaintiffs to swift and speedy justice 
a safe and efficient transportation system is essential to keeping people and goods moving and cities and communities prosperous 
congestion and delay not only waste our time as individuals they also burden businesses and our entire economy with inefficiency and higher costs 
republicans strongly support a comprehensive transportation policy agenda that enhances safety reduces congestion modernizes infrastructure and promotes economic growth 
our national railroad network is a crucial component of our public transportation system 
railroads helped build our country and our national passenger railroad network plays a key role in transportation and economic growth 
republicans support where economically viable the development of a highspeed passenger railroad system as an instrument of economic development and enhanced mobility 
republicans support a healthy intercity passenger rail system 
amtrak provides a valuable service to passengers especially in the northeast corridor 
but we recognize that the goal of establishing a national passenger rail system with modest federal support has failed to materialize 
clearly the financial problems plaguing amtrak can not be solved simply by continued infusions of taxpayer dollars 
fundamental reforms should be enacted to transition amtrak into operational selfsufficiency 
a stable affordable more independent energy supply is vital to fueling americas economic growth increasing prosperity helping families afford prices at the pump and making america more secure 
president bush and republicans in congress recognize the need for a balanced energy policy that increases both energy production and conservation 
we need a comprehensive energy policy so that we will no longer lurch from one energy crisis to the next 
recent electricity blackouts the california energy crisis natural gas and oil price spikes and high gasoline prices remind us that only a comprehensive energy policy will produce energy stability for americas families and businesses 
as one of his first acts in office president bush released the national energy policy nep report a comprehensive plan to reduce americas dependence on foreign sources of energy by increasing domestic energy production and supporting conservation and alternative and renewable energy 
the presidents proposal would make america more energy independent while creating jobs and promoting economic growth 
it includes over recommendations nearly half of which addressed renewable energy energy efficiency and conservation 
president bush has implemented nearly every nonlegislative recommendation outlined in the nep report 
republicans in the house and senate have stood solidly with the president 
we endorse the presidents policy appreciate the hard work of congressional republicans in the face of intractable partisan opposition and urge final passage of a bill to secure americas energy future 
•republicans support developing new technologies for more efficient generation and use of power 
new technologies will allow us to create new jobproducing industries and save jobs in industries that have long been staples of americas economy 
for instance working with congressional republicans the president has already committed billion over years for clean coal research and development which helps keep americas coal industry strong and reduces the emissions associated with coal use 
as part of that commitment we support futuregen an international publicprivate initiative to build the worlds first integrated sequestration and hydrogen research power plant that would burn coal more cleanly 
president bushs clear skies initiative would create a billion private market to deploy these clean coal technologies 
•the republican party supports research and investment designed to realize the enormous benefits of a hydrogen economy and put the united states on the cutting edge of energy technology 
the freedomcar partnership and hydrogen fuel initiative include billion over five years to begin building hydrogen cars and the infrastructure to support them 
•using the most sophisticated technologies we can explore and develop oil resources here at home with minimal environmental impact 
our party continues to support energy development in the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr which according to the us geological survey holds as much as billion barrels of oil enough to replace oil imports from saudi arabia for nearly years 
the drilling footprint can be confined to just acres the entire refuge contains million acres about the size of washingtons dulles airport on ice roads that melt away in the summer leaving little trace of human intervention 
we have already wasted precious time 
if the previous administration had not vetoed the anwr proposal passed by the republican congress in at this moment anwr would be producing up to one million barrels of oil a day 
• republicans strongly support removing unnecessary barriers to domestic natural gas production and expanding environmentally sound production in new areas such as alaska and the rocky mountains 
increasing supply including the construction of a new natural gas pipeline from alaska to the lower will bring needed relief to consumers and make americas businesses more competitive in the global marketplace 
•last summer the largest blackout in north american history affected states leaving more than million americans without power 
republicans support measures to modernize the nations electricity grid to prevent future blackouts and provide american consumers and businesses with more affordable reliable power 
we will work to unleash innovation so entrepreneurs can develop technologies for a more advanced and robust transmission system that meets our growing energy demands 
we also support the establishment of mandatory enforceable reliability rules for electric utilities to reduce the likelihood of future blackouts 
•republicans will continue to support renewable energy through extension of the production tax credit for wind and biomass as well as efforts to expand the use of biodiesel and ethanol which can reduce americas dependence on foreign oil while increasing revenues to farmers 
•nuclear power provides america with affordable emissionsfree energy 
we believe nuclear power can help reduce our dependence on foreign energy and play an invaluable role in addressing global climate change 
president bush supports construction of new nuclear power plants through the nuclear power initiative and continues to move forward on creating an environmentally sound nuclear waste repository 
public education access for every child to an excellent education is a foundation of a free civil society 
the children who enter schools today will leave as young adults full of dreams for the future 
they will soon become the scientists and researchers who make great discoveries the engineers and mathematicians who build our communities the doctors and nurses who heal and comfort the sick the teachers who will educate the next generation the leaders who transform government the poets artists and writers who entertain and inspire 
every child deserves a firstrate education because every child holds infinite potential and we should give them every opportunity to reach it 
we believe there is an inseparable link between a vibrant economy and a highquality education system 
it takes a vibrant economy to provide the tax base necessary to fund a highquality education system 
equally it takes a quality education system to provide the highly skilled labor force necessary to meet the demands of a growing vibrant economy 
strong schools will also produce a workforce with the skills to compete in the st century economy 
we must have citizens capable of conceiving the next generation of new technologies and innovations mastering the art of analyzing problems and crafting their solutions 
education is the key to prosperity and fulfillment the foundation on which all other success is built 
on just his fourth day in office president bush presented the no child left behind initiative to congress 
less than a year later he secured an overwhelming bipartisan majority to pass the no child left behind act of 
it was the most significant overhaul of federal education policy since 
and it became a promise kept to parents students teachers and every american 
• ensuring stronger accountability for student achievement for all children 
• encouraging education methods that work 
• providing flexibility and control to states and local communities 
•giving parents more information about the quality of their childrens schools and offering them choices and resources for their childrens education 
results are now measured on the basis of student achievement rather than simply dollars spent 
students are benefiting from education reforms that set high academic standards encourage strong parental involvement recognize the role of excellent teachers foster safe and orderly classrooms and establish a commitment to teaching the basics of reading and math 
with this success republicans have transformed the debate on education 
we are the party parents can trust to improve schools and provide opportunity for all children in every neighborhood regardless of background or income 
we are the party willing to embrace new ideas and put them to the test 
americans agree that the status quo in education is no longer acceptable 
we have challenged low expectations and poor achievement and we are seeing results 
now is the time to extend the progress weve made 
the no child left behind act is already showing gains in elementary school as student achievement scores for fourth and eighthgraders have increased in classrooms across america 
our next mission is to take the reforms that we know are working in elementary schools and apply them up and down the education ladder starting in early childhood education so that children enter school ready to learn and finishing in high school so that every young adult who graduates has the skills he or she needs to succeed in the st century economy 
for too long the value of a high school diploma has declined as students leave school without even basic skills like reading and math let alone the advanced math and science skills the modern workforce demands 
we pledge to bring real reform to high schools 
thanks to president bushs vision and the success of the no child left behind act we have a track record worthy of americans trust 
we recognize that under the american constitutional system education is a state local and family responsibility not a federal obligation 
since over percent of public school funding is state and local not federal it is obvious that state and local governments must assume most of the responsibility to improve the schools and the role of the federal government must be limited as we return control to parents teachers and local school boards 
president bush and congressional republicans have provided the largest increase in federal education funding in history and the highest percentage gain since the s 
support for elementary and secondary education has had the largest increase in any single presidential term since the s an increase of nearly percent since 
the president and congress are particularly focused on programs for americas neediest students including minorities and children with special needs 
with this increased funding comes a new focus on achievement and results 
the president and republicans in congress recognize that states and local communities are most directly responsible for the quality of education in their schools 
that is why the no child left behind act stipulates that the states not the federal government develop an accountability plan that will work best for them 
since president bush signed nclb into law all states have developed an accountability plan of assessments graduation rates and other key indicators of student achievement for all individual students and groups of students 
under the no child left behind act every child counts 
no child will be hidden in a maze of numbers 
if some children are struggling while others succeed we will praise success and deliver help to students who need it 
our party believes as does the president that reading is the new civil right 
every child must be able to read by the end of the third grade 
the president and congressional republicans have taken important steps to help every student achieve that goal 
the reading first initiative brings scientifically based reading instruction including phonics to children in the early grades 
over billion in funding for reading programs provides training for teachers and materials for children 
in addition since the passage of the no child left behind act states have received additional funds for early childhood reading efforts 
the republican party strongly supports school choice because choice creates competition and competition puts the focus on quality 
president bush republican governors and members of congress have worked to expand parental choice and encourage competition by providing parents with information on their childs school increasing the number of charter schools and expanding education savings accounts for use from kindergarten through college 
under nclb states and school districts publish report cards showing how well students are achieving so communities and parents can know how well their schools are doing 
parents of children in schools identified as needing improvement can choose another public school or get tutoring or other help for their child 
president bush and the republican congress enacted the dc school choice initiative the first federally funded school choice demonstration program 
we commend the president and congress for making dcs schoolchildren the most important special interest in education improvement 
and we support state efforts to expand school choice as well as the presidents call to provide funding for new and existing charter schools including assistance for school facilities 
we believe that competition between schools is an effective option to improve the educational benefits for our children 
the republican party supports the efforts of parents who choose faithbased and other nonpublic school options for their children 
we are beginning to see success as a result of the no child left behind act at the elementary level and now we must improve our high schools so that every graduate is prepared for the rigors of college for the best jobs of the st century economy or for military service 
president bush has proposed a number of initiatives to improve math and science education help striving readers and raise standards for high schools 
research confirms what every parent knows to be true through commonsense and experience a good teacher makes all the difference in a childs education 
the no child left behind act set the goal of having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom by the school year 
states have been provided flexibility and resources to make sure teachers have the skills and tools to be successful with all children 
these needed reforms are backed by historic levels of funding for teacher quality initiatives and support for teachers including training recruitment incentives loan forgiveness and tax relief 
we must also work to reduce the barriers that are keeping qualified professionals from entering the classroom by expanding alternative pathways to teacher certification programs like troops to teachers which helps former military personnel become classroom teachers and transition to teaching which provides training for people who want to become teachers and encourages states to develop and expand alternative routes to teacher licensure and certification 
every teacher and every student deserves a safe classroom in which to work and learn 
the no child left behind act ensures that teachers and other school professionals can undertake reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in the classroom without the fear of litigation 
the law provides civil immunity in any state court and limits the financial liability of teachers instructors principals administrators and other education professionals for actions taken to maintain discipline order or control in the school or classroom 
we support the presidents good start grow smart initiative which strengthens head start by increasing accountability in the program so that students start kindergarten with the early skills they need 
it also includes the early reading first initiative designed to improve existing early education programs to prepare young children to succeed in school especially those from lowincome families 
states should be able to coordinate preschool programs with head start programs in exchange for meeting certain accountability requirements 
community colleges play a vital role in not only cultivating citizens for the st century but also equipping them with the essential skills and training needed for jobs in the new economy 
because they are so adaptable and accessible community colleges are increasingly critical providers of job training both for degreeseekers and for workers seeking to retool refine and broaden their skills 
we support the presidents highgrowth job training initiative which has provided seed money to fund job training partnerships between community colleges and local highgrowth industries 
republicans are working to ensure that college is affordable and accessible for americas low and middleincome families through increased funding of grants lowinterest student loans and tax breaks for working families 
as a result of republican leadership total student aid for higher education has increased to a historic billion proposed for 
next year almost million students and parents will receive one or more grants loans or workstudy awards 
the president has requested record levels of pell grant funding 
these grants will help an estimated million lowincome students pay for higher education one million more students than when president bush and vice president cheney came to office 
under a new enhanced pell grant proposal lowincome students who take a rigorous high school curriculum the kind of curriculum that will best prepare them for success in college will be eligible to receive an additional per year 
to ensure that america remains the world leader in the innovation economy and to ensure that americas graduates have the training they need to compete for the best jobs of the st century president bush proposes to expand opportunities for math and science education in colleges and universities 
needy students studying math and science will be eligible to receive additional college aid 
republicans have made historically black colleges and universities hbcus and hispanic serving institutions hsis a priority 
for more than a century hbcus and hsis have played a vital role in providing opportunities for excellence in higher education to millions of african american and hispanic students 
today their mission continues and it deserves our support 
we applaud president bush for fulfilling his pledge to increase funding for hbcus and hsis by percent since 
millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families 
we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports 
as the dynamic global economy forces many workers to consider changing fields or adding new skills the president and republican congress want to make training for new jobs easier to come by and more flexible in providing individualized assistance 
ensuring that workers have the tools they need to succeed in the st century economy is a critical step in helping americans be selfsufficient and successful 
it is also critical to maintaining our position as the most productive and strongest economy in the world 
we support effective and enhanced job training programs that offer states additional flexibility and individuals more choice to design their own workforce training programs 
the presidents personal reemployment accounts would provide unemployed workers flexible support and incentives in finding a job 
and president bush and congressional republicans are also providing unprecedented assistance for workers adversely affected by foreign trade including additional training income support and health care assistance 
with english as our nations common language people from every corner of the world have come together to build this great nation 
english empowers 
for newcomers it is the fastest route to mainstream american life better paying jobs and owning a piece of the american dream 
furthermore fluency in english should be the goal of bilingual education 
at the same time mastery of other languages is important for americas competitiveness in the world market 
we advocate foreign language training in our schools and fostering respect for other languages and cultures throughout society 
we affirm the timehonored right of individuals to voluntarily participate in labor organizations and tobargain collectively 
we also believe that no american should be coerced into an association they do not wish to join 
and no one should be kept out of a job for which they are qualified simply because they choose to remain independent of labor unions 
we therefore support the right of states to enact righttowork laws 
republicans respect the enormous sacrifices and commitment of the workers including building tradesmen who responded to the attacks of september th 
thanks to their skill courage and patriotism the very dangerous work at the world trade center and pentagon was done remarkably quickly and without a single fatality 
we will always remember and honor the efforts of the rescue and recovery workers who dedicated countless hours to helping america recover 
all american workers deserve workplaces that are safe healthy and fair 
the president and republican congress have supported efforts to improve workplace safety without burdening businesses with costly and unnecessary regulations 
and these efforts are showing results overall workplace fatalities and injuries are at record low levels 
american workers deserve fair wages for hours spent working overtime 
we are proud of the fact that million additional workers now have guaranteed overtime protections as a result of republican efforts to modernize labor laws left untouched since 
for the first time ever the regulations explicitly guarantee overtime protection to blue collar workers police firefighters emts factory workers construction workers and licensed practical nurses among others 
with clearly defined overtime rules that recognize the realities of the modern workforce employees and employers will have a greater understanding of their rights and responsibilities 
workers who pay dues through their workplace deserve to know how their dues are being used especially when the money is being used to support political activity 
republicans have enhanced financial disclosure requirements for political campaigns corporations and pension funds in order to bring about more transparency and accountability in the political system 
and the bush administration improved union financial disclosure forms to offer union members more information about how their dues money is spent 
we encourage management and unions to find common ground thereby ensuring economic viability for both 
men and women who retire after decades spent in the workforce are entitled to the pensions they and their employers have contributed to throughout their careers 
as part of the economic growth and tax relief bill workers pension payments are now calculated on the basis of their best three years of earnings rather than their last three 
this protects workers whose earnings decline with their age 
in addition criminal prosecutions against employers and plan trustees who abuse pension and health plans have increased by more than percent since 
more than billion has been secured through court judgments settlements and fines covering million workers and their dependents by holding those who manage benefit plans accountable for their legal obligations to protect plan participants 
thanks to republican efforts to enforce the law the word is getting out that benefits managers should invest and manage employees retirement funds as carefully as they would handle their own 
republicans recognize the historical federal health care promise made to coal industry retirees 
the party will seek to ensure that health care needs of orphan retirees in the coal industry will be covered and will seek to ensure the continuation of those benefits 
the cost of providing health care for employees is a major burden for american businesses 
health insurance costs for employers have been rising every year since causing businesses to hire fewer new employees and too many families to go without insurance 
studies show that percent of uninsured americans either work for a small business or are dependent upon someone who does 
the way to alleviate that burden is to bring down the cost of health care in america 
shifting the costburden onto the federal or state governments costs that will ultimately be borne by the taxpayers is not an effective solution to the problem 
we must attack the root causes of high health care costs by aiding small businesses in offering health care to their employees empowering the selfemployed through access to affordable coverage putting patients and doctors in charge of medical decisions reducing junk lawsuits and limiting punitive damage awards that raise the cost of health care and seizing the costsaving and qualityenhancing potential of emerging health technologies 
it is also important that we reaffirm our partys firm rejection of any measure aimed at making health care a governmentrun enterprise 
we support legislation to enable small employers to pool together to offer health insurance options to their employees 
the legislation already passed by the house gives small businesses the same purchasing power currently enjoyed by large employers and labor unions 
this will go a long way toward providing health care coverage for americas uninsured percent of whom are estimated to work for or be dependent on someone who works for a small business 
the medical liability system is harming our medical delivery system 
doctors are afraid to practice medicine 
frequent unwarranted lawsuits force doctors out of certain specialty areas and geographic regions 
the most dangerous result of this is the declining availability of emergency trauma care and womens health services 
in many cases costs are so prohibitive that many obstetricsgynecology practices are scaling back service or choosing not to practice altogether 
junk lawsuits add at least billion to health care costs in america because doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine ordering extensive unnecessary and expensive tests and procedures to keep trial lawyers at bay 
the president has proposed and the republican house of representatives has passed reforms that would speed compensation to injured patients reduce health care costs and improve americans access to quality health care 
shamefully driven by the powerful trial lawyer lobby democrat senators have repeatedly thwarted the efforts of the republican majority to deliver meaningful medical liability reform 
they have employed their obstructionist tactics three times in the current congress alone 
the republican party reaffirms its commitment to putting patients and doctors ahead of trial lawyers 
we will continue to battle for litigation reforms that help keep doctors in practice adopt reasonable caps on noneconomic awards in medical malpractice suits and ensure that americans have access to quality affordable health care 
estimates indicate that between and americans die each year from medical errors while as much as billion is spent each year on health care that does not help patients unnecessary inappropriate inefficient or ineffective treatments 
this is absolutely unacceptable 
high costs medical errors administrative inefficiencies and poor coordination are all closely connected to our failure to use health information technology as an integral part of medical care 
republicans support president bushs goal of ensuring that most americans have electronic health records within the next years 
he has requested funding for demonstration projects for broader adoption of health it systems in communities and states 
already the use of health it in the veterans administration has shown improvements in the quality of care and reductions in the cost 
the administration is working with private sector innovators to develop reliable secure methods of storing personal medical information that will broaden the benefits of health it 
privacy is paramount and participation by patients will be voluntary 
these electronic health records will be designed to share information among and between health care providers only when authorized by a patient 
advances at the nexus of science and technology raise serious moral and legal questions 
for example although medical conditions have been linked to certain genetic markers there is no certainty that many of these diseases will actually develop 
there is growing concern that employers and insurance companies will use genetic information to discriminate by denying jobs or insurance coverage to individuals who have predictive genetic markers for certain diseases 
we support efforts to enact genetic discrimination legislation that is fair reasonable and consistent with existing laws to prevent discrimination 
in addition we must take action to allow doctors and hospitals to review best practices without fear of litigation 
by sharing information health professionals can determine ways to avoid errors and complications 
these efforts are blocked however because goodfaith efforts to improve quality and safety are targets for lawsuits based on new information that is made public in the review process 
we support the work of the president and republicans in congress on legislation to make it possible for health professionals to work together more effectively to provide the best possible care for all patients 
republicans recognize that the role of government in the st century economy is to foster an environment in which innovation can flourish 
the information revolution is the product of the creative efforts and hard work of men and women in the private sector who have had the freedom to innovate 
at the same time we recognize the magnitude and pace of change require vigilance by government to make the most of the opportunities mitigate the possible downsides of rapid technological advancement and protect the technology industry from modern day pirates at home and abroad both those who violate copyrights and those who loot by litigation 
the technological innovation we have experienced thus far is surely only the beginning of almost unimaginable growth and change 
we will seize this historic opportunity 
the united states remains the largest producer and exporter of manufactured goods in the world despite enduring significant challenges during the economic downturn 
the us needs a national minerals strategy to supply the country with minerals and metals vital to national and economic security and to the competitiveness of us manufacturing 
the continued primacy of us manufacturing is due in large part to the administrations manufacturing initiative which represents the first time in modern history that an administration has made us manufacturing a top priority 
we support the administrations efforts in this regard as a recognition of the critical role of manufacturing to job creation national security and the economy 
americas economy is undergoing a fundamental transition from one based primarily on manufacturing to one based on innovation services and ideas 
twothirds of americas economic growth in the s resulted from the introduction of new technology and percent of the new jobs of the st century require postsecondary education yet only onethird of americas workforce has achieved that level 
in order to maintain americas global leadership republicans have provided unprecedented support for federal research and development to help spur innovation 
federal rd funding is up percent from to billion in which includes a percent increase in support for basic research 
the president has doubled the budget for the national institutes of health and increased the national science foundation budget by percent 
president bush and the republican party also support making the rd tax credit permanent 
the rapid pace of technological development demands that we remain on the leading edge of innovation and science 
republicans are committed to providing the investment and incentives needed to foster next generation technologies 
the st century nanotechnology research and development act passed by a republican congress and signed by president bush increased funding for nanotechnology research 
in addition the president has dedicated billion over five years to develop hydrogen fuel cells and related nextgeneration energy technologies 
the presidents support for nasa and vision for space exploration will also enhance scientific development and technological breakthroughs 
broadband provides americans with highspeed internet access connections that improve the nations economic productivity and offer lifeenhancing applications such as distance learning remote medical diagnostics and the ability to work from home more effectively 
broadband technology will enhance our nations economic competitiveness and will help improve education and health care for all americans 
republicans have implemented a wide range of policies to create economic incentives remove regulatory barriers and promote new technologies all of which are essential to making broadband competitively available and affordable 
president bush established the goal of providing every american with access to affordable broadband by 
we recognize that taxing broadband access would increase its cost to consumers and stifle the extension of broadband service 
the president has signed into law a twoyear extension of the internet access tax moratorium and is working with congressional republicans to pass legislation that would explicitly extend the moratorium to broadband and make it permanent 
republicans are working to reduce burdensome regulations that discourage broadband investment 
highspeed internet access should not be governed by regulations established decades ago for the telephone 
consumers should have more options for affordable broadband access 
the promise of broadband over power lines and wireless internet access provide new opportunities to connect households schools and businesses to the internet 
under the presidents leadership the administration has nearly doubled the amount of spectrum available for innovative wireless broadband applications such as wifi and wimax 
•broadband adoption has grown percent from december to december from million to million lines 
• over percent of zip codes have broadband access 
• ninetyfour percent of public schools have broadband access to the internet 
by applying st century policy to st century technology we will encourage new investment that will bring broadband to even more homes in more areas of america 
community is more than just a set of streets and sidewalks and homes 
the strength of communities is the people who inhabit them the american citizens who spend their days working striving and caring for their families and advancing toward the realization of their dreams 
to ensure that all americans have an opportunity to build better lives we must provide the framework in which communities can flourish 
that requires access to affordable and accessible health care protection of americas environment and natural resources the maintenance of public safety and prosecution of people who violate the peace of communities guaranteed rights and equal opportunities for all members of society and compassionate help for our fellow citizens who are trapped in unhealthy or harmful situations 
republicans know that the heart and soul of america are found in communities across the nation 
we honor the individual character and diversity of communities throughout america and we seek to help citizens strengthen the places they call home 
republicans recognize that health care is intrinsic to every familys economic comfort 
americans must have the security to know that the next illness will not wipe out their savings or drive them into debt 
we appreciate the fact that marketbased health care has given america the most advanced medical system in the world 
proposals discussed earlier such as health savings accounts and association health plans provide economic benefits while also making health care more consumerdriven and increasing access to highquality affordable health care 
we reject any notion of governmentrun universal health care because we have seen evidence from around the world that governmentrun health care leads to inefficiencies long waiting periods and often substandard health care 
and we applaud efforts by president bush and the republican congress to reform the broken medical liability system that is raising health care costs and limiting patients access to doctors doctors who are being driven out of their practices by excessive medical liability costs 
we support continued efforts to make health care more affordable more accessible and more consumerdriven 
in the congress passed and president bush signed historic legislation that strengthens and adds a prescription drug benefit to medicare 
the new prescription drug benefit will be available to million seniors and people with disabilities on january 
until that time beneficiaries have access to immediate and significant savings on prescription drugs through medicareapproved prescription drug discount cards 
since drug discount cards became available on june four million medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the program and more enroll each week 
seniors are saving up to percent off the retail price of brand name drugs and up to percent off the price of generic drugs 
in addition more help is available for those who need it most 
lowincome seniors receive this year and next year to assist them with the costs of their prescriptions 
under the new drug benefit seniors who like the coverage they have today can keep it 
the new law will encourage employers to continue their retiree health benefits by offering them subsidies for their current plans and giving them the option to supplement the new medicare drug benefit in the same way they supplement current medicare doctor and hospital benefits 
the medicare prescription drug and modernization act improves many facets of the medicare program 
it increases funding for doctors hospitals and other health care providers especially in rural areas where reimbursement levels are far below what is paid in other regions of the country 
the new law will also transform medicare into a program that not only enables the treatment of disease but helps people stay healthy 
in addition to a new welcome to medicare physical the program will contain new services and screenings to help detect and prevent heart disease diabetes and other major illnesses 
we also applaud the addition of income relation for the medicare part b premium to further protect the medicare program for the future and to protect low income seniors from increased costs 
we applaud the president and republicans in congress for their determination to follow through on this promise to americas seniors 
while others spent many years talking about adding a prescription drug benefit to medicare this president and this congress got it done 
to improve access for the underserved the republican congress and the white house have championed the largest expansion in the history of the community health centers program 
community health centers are locallycontrolled private providers of primary and preventive care services in the most underserved communities in the country 
health centers are not federal providers 
funds are awarded competitively to underserved communities through the federal grant program 
community health centers provide access to doctors and nurses regardless of a patients ability to pay 
one in four children from lowincome families receives health care at community health centers 
the president and congress have already made it possible for community health centers to serve an additional million americans a total of million as part of the presidents fiveyear plan to fund new or expanded sites to serve an additional million people 
today there are more than new or expanded health centers delivering preventive and primary care to patients in medically underserved communities across america 
we endorse plans to continue increasing access to community health centers so that uninsured and lowincome americans have reliable options for receiving highquality medical care 
the president has worked to help states develop new approaches to expand coverage in their medicaid and schip programs 
waivers and state plan amendments approved by the department of health and human services have expanded eligibility under these programs to more than million children and improved benefits for more than million children and adults since 
by working with governors of both parties the bush administration is fostering the creation of innovative approaches to health care access and delivery by the states 
we support enhancing efforts to reach the parents of children who are eligible for schip so that more children receive health coverage 
we applaud the presidents commitment to increasing health coverage for all americans 
he proposed a refundable tax credit that will make health insurance more affordable to millions of americans who do not have employerprovided insurance or public insurance 
the treasury department estimates the tax credit will extend insurance to between four and five million americans 
the trade promotion authority bill supported by the republican congress and signed by president bush provides a tax credit to help workers obtain health insurance coverage if they have lost their jobs due to international trade 
the tax credit has helped thousands of displaced workers get insurance coverage 
as republicans we hold dear the health and vitality of our families 
our efforts to build healthier families must begin with women our mothers daughters grandmothers and granddaughters 
women have unique health care needs 
they are underrepresented in medical research and often do not have access to the appropriate level of medical care and treatment 
across this country and at all levels of government republicans are aggressively developing health care initiatives targeted specifically at the needs of women through expanded research treatment disease management prevention and screening initiatives 
the enormous increases in the budget of the national institutes of health nih brought about by the republican congress and president bush are making possible groundbreaking clinical trials and new research into diseases and health issues that disproportionately affect women 
this new research also has yielded important discoveries pertaining to conditions that affect the elderly the majority of whom are women and should promote future benefit 
the increasing focus upon health care for the elderly holds promise for advances in the treatment of osteoporosis heart disease and other ailments that should no longer be considered the inevitable price of old age 
we also are leading efforts to reach out to underserved and minority female populations where disparities persist in life expectancy infant mortality and death rates from cancer heart disease diabetes and other illnesses 
moreover we favor increased efforts both through expanded research and expanded care to improve maternal and child health care as well as health care services for women before during and after pregnancy 
republicans are dedicated to pursuing womens health care initiatives that include access to stateoftheart medical advances and technology equality for women in the delivery of health care services medical research that focuses specifically on women appropriate representation of women in clinical trials expanded access to prevention screening health promotion chronic care and disease management services and direct access to womens health providers 
disparities in health and health care based upon race ethnicity socioeconomic status or geography are unacceptable 
historically african americans hispanics asian americans pacific islanders american indians and alaska natives have experienced poorer health outcomes and received lowerquality care than the majority of americans 
for example infant mortality rates are twice as high among african americans as whites and african american children are twice as likely to have asthma and six times as likely to die from asthma as white children 
the prevalence of hivaids in latino populations is four times higher than among whites while the prevalence among african americans is nine times higher than that of whites 
in addition hispanics are nearly twice as likely to die from diabetes as whites and african american adults are almost twice as likely to die from heart disease as whites 
there is also strong evidence that people living in rural and other nonmetropolitan areas regardless of their race or ethnicity are more likely to experience access problems and poorer health outcomes 
republicans are committed to addressing these health and health care disparities 
progress has been made in recent years in a number of areas including enhancement of federal research on health disparities identification of barriers to care for our increasingly diverse population expansion of the number of health professionals who are committed to serving minority and underserved patients and their communities and improvement in the quality of care for uninsured and underserved populations 
republicans believe we must build on this success and increase these efforts 
we strongly support initiatives to improve the quality of care delivered to all americans 
we applaud president bush for supporting treatment of mental illness 
mental and physical illness should be treated equitably and fairly 
in addition we support improved training for health providers including efforts to improve communication collaboration and understanding between patients and doctors 
we are funding research to find cures and treatments for illnesses that disproportionately affect minority populations as well as targeted wellcoordinated programs to prevent manage and treat these diseases 
we support efforts to encourage qualified minorities to enter the fields of science and medicine 
america is the worlds leader in developing the medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs that have revolutionized health care 
president bush and the republican congress recognize and strongly support scientific advancement especially in the area of biomedical research 
working together with president bush the republican congress has fulfilled its pledge to double funding for the national institutes of health 
with increased funding the nih is now supporting nearly projects an alltime high 
government investment in biomedical research yields tangible benefits resulting in decreased death rates better access to health care and a better quality of life for all americans especially for underserved and minority populations 
quality research provides benefits including disease prevention early detection and new more effective treatments for heart disease stroke diabetes cancer parkinsons disease alzheimers and hivaids 
republicans continue to be active leaders in setting sound biomedical research policy and remain committed to placing a high priority on continued world leadership in research while maintaining accountability for the use of resources and a responsibility to uphold the highest ethical standards 
republicans have supported and will continue to support important scientific research without undermining the fundamental ethical principles that have guided medical research in this country for decades 
we especially welcome and encourage a stronger emphasis on adult stem cell and cord blood stem cell research which has already provided benefits to hundreds of patients and provides real promise for treatments to help millions of americans 
we recognize that president bush made a carefully considered decision to allow federal funding for stem cell research for the first time and did not affect stem cell research in the private sector 
we strongly support the presidents policy that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to encourage the future destruction of human embryos 
in addition we applaud the presidents call for a comprehensive ban on human cloning and on the creation of human embryos solely for experimentation 
in august president bush stated the hope it offers is amazing… 
yet the ethics of medicine are not infinitely adaptable 
there is at least one bright line we do not end some lives for the medical benefit of others ” 
we wholeheartedly agree 
as americans live longer we must consider the costs of spending more years in retirement and the increasing health care needs associated with aging 
there is a growing need for longterm care and it calls for longterm planning both by individuals and by government 
we encourage at all levels of government regulatory flexibility and sensitivity to individual needs in nursing homes and related facilities 
sacrifices are being made by millions of men and women to care for their mothers and fathers 
we support proposals by president bush and republicans in congress to recognize and reward individual responsibility and compassion by creating an abovetheline tax deduction for premiums of longterm care insurance and allowing an additional personal tax exemption for taking care of an elderly parent at home 
as americans we must honor our commitment to the million veterans in the united states 
america is dedicated to honoring its commitment to these patriots 
veterans have helped shape the american character and their service represents the highest form of national service 
president bush and congress have increased funding for veterans services including substantial increases in veterans administration va health care funding 
this additional funding has made it possible for the va to improve health care access for veterans who need it most including lowincome veterans those with serviceconnected disabilities and those who need vas specialized services 
president bush has twice signed legislation effectively providing concurrent receipt of both military retiree pay and va disability compensation for combatinjured and highlydisabled veterans thus reversing a centuryold law preventing concurrent receipts 
in addition president bush has fulfilled his promise to cut the disability claims backlog that existed when he took office and reduce waiting times for veterans seeking initial medical care 
we support more care to more veterans in more places where they need it most 
we also applaud the presidents efforts to maintain and expand our national cemeteries 
and with world war ii veterans dying at the rate of a day we note with great appreciation the opening of the nations world war ii memorial in washington dc 
our veterans have fought and defended this country in many wars and proudly raised the american flag on such faraway places as san juan hill iwo jima and pork chop hill and it has become a symbol of our american spirit and unity 
we as well as they deplore the deliberate desecration of our flag and state that its deliberate desecration is not free speech but rather an assault against both our proud history and our greatest hopes 
we therefore support a constitutional amendment that will restore to the people through their elected representatives their right to safeguard old glory 
republicans know that economic prosperity is essential to environmental progress 
that belief is supported by compelling historical evidence 
for example over the last years air pollution from the six major pollutants decreased substantially even as our population grew our energy consumption increased and the economy expanded 
our partys environmental policies are geared towards results 
thanks to president bushs strong leadership and the commitment of congressional republicans to reform and innovation air pollution has been reduced water quality has improved wetlands have been restored and more than a thousand brownfields sites are being revitalized 
republicans also acknowledge the progress made by states and local communities in environmental stewardship efforts 
as the laboratories of innovation they should be given flexibility and authority to address many environmental concerns 
finally we link the security of private property to our environmental agenda because environmental stewardship has been best advanced where property is privately held 
after all people who live on the land work the land and own the land also love the land and protect it 
president bush and the republican congress will safeguard private property rights by enforcing the takings clause of the fifth amendment and by providing just compensation whenever private property is needed to achieve a compelling public purpose 
we support president bushs clear skies proposal the most aggressive presidential initiative in history to reduce power plant emissions 
clear skies through a proven capandtrade system will reduce by percent emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury 
the marketbased policies in clear skies along with a percent cut in pollution from diesel vehicles will help states meet new more stringent standards to protect public health 
the presidents plan also provides regulatory certainty enabling power plants to install stateoftheart pollution control technologies 
these steps will lead to significant environmental improvements while ensuring a reliable affordable electricity supply and keeping americas coal industry strong 
two years ago president bush fulfilled a campaign promise and signed legislation to clean up more of the abandoned and polluted industrial sites known as brownfields 
so far the bush administration has restored more than brownfields to usable condition which is more than were restored in the previous seven years 
and that work continues 
by prioritizing cleanup of brownfields we are encouraging growth on existing sites and thus preserving greenfields and undeveloped land 
we are also opening usable land for small businesses and residents in hundreds of communities and creating thousands of jobs 
we support these efforts to revitalize urban neighborhoods both aesthetically and economically 
president bushs commitment to national parks is producing results parks are better managed better funded and better protected 
over the last four years president bush has been fulfilling his campaign promise to address the billion maintenance backlog plaguing the national park system 
republicans will continue to support president bushs approach to improving national parks and will move forward with commonsense management reforms that maximize visitor satisfaction and protect and conserve the parks natural resources for future generations 
our air land and water have all become cleaner in the last four years and this progress can be seen all across america 
the farm bill provided unprecedented levels of funding to enhance conservation efforts by farmers and ranchers 
and last year president bush worked with the republican leadership in congress to pass the healthy forests restoration act 
this law based on the presidents healthy forests initiative is reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire saving lives and property and improving the health of our forests 
americas wetlands serve as habitat for thousands of species of wildlife 
they also help to trap pollution clean the water reduce the impact of floods and stabilize shore areas 
three decades ago the united states was losing wetlands at the rate of about acres each year 
president bush is working with the republican congress and state and local officials to fulfill his new national goal to increase wetland acres and quality by restoring improving and protecting at least three million wetland acres over the next five years 
to achieve this worthy goal our party also will focus on critical resource needs including implementing a sensible plan to address coastal erosion in the gulf coast region 
chronic water shortages in the west are one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the nation in the coming decades 
we support efforts by the administration to work with states and local communities in the west to expand the use of proven tools like marketbased voluntary transfers through water banks and other watermarketing tools 
we also endorse the presidents efforts to work with the state of florida to implement the comprehensive everglades restoration plan 
our party reaffirms the traditional primacy of states over water allocation 
we steadfastly oppose diverting water away from the great lakes region 
republicans are committed to developing an integrated comprehensive national oceans policy 
the president and congress have supported the work of the us oceans commission which will offer important recommendations to improve management observation and conservation of oceans and coastal resources for future generations 
republicans are committed to meeting the challenge of longterm global climate change by relying on markets and new technologies to improve energy efficiency 
these efforts will help reduce emissions over time while allowing the economy to grow 
our president and our party strongly oppose the kyoto protocol and similar mandatory carbon emissions controls that harm economic growth and destroy american jobs 
the endangered species act esa serves a noble purpose which americans overwhelmingly support 
our party remains committed to the goal of protecting species to enhance their chances for survival 
over the last years successes under esa have been limited due to confrontation and polarization including an evergrowing barrage of litigation preventing the fish and wildlife service from protecting new species and recovering plants and animals already listed as threatened or endangered 
republicans believe we can achieve greater progress in protecting species for future generations through resultsbased cooperative conservation programs and voluntary agreements that encourage private stewardship 
the esa must be updated to reflect new approaches that focus resources on species in need of recovery not lawsuits 
as with other major federal environmental laws esa should require peerreviewed science so resources can be focused on the most pressing recovery efforts 
just as importantly the act should encourage expansion of voluntary agreements with private property owners while ensuring that esa enforcement respects and upholds private property rights 
american farm and ranch families embody some of the best values of our nation hard work and risktaking love of the land and love of our country 
farming is the first industry of america the industry that feeds us the industry that clothes us and the industry that increasingly provides more of our energy 
the success of americas farmers and ranchers is essential to the success of the american economy 
the president put his words into action when he signed the farm bill passed with strong support from republicans in congress 
and president bush continues to pursue and enforce international trade agreements that affect farmers and ranchers 
republican policies are working such as the recently revitalized wto doha round negotiations that will create new opportunities for us farmers and ranchers by cutting foreign tariffs expanding quotas for american products and eliminating agricultural export subsidies 
since the us farm economy has enjoyed tremendous improvement and is today in a position of historic strength 
farmers net cash income for was billion an percent increase from 
and farmers equity reached a record trillion last year putting american agriculture in its best financial health ever 
there is much more to rural america than agriculture ranching and forestry 
the kind of economic development that generates familysustaining jobs is critical to small towns and rural communities 
president bush and the republican congress are promoting good schools accessible health care decent housing safe drinking water and waste disposal and efficient transportation 
they also are expanding the availability of the internet and broadband service to allow people in rural america to access worldclass technology 
we are proud to meet in a city that enjoyed a new birth of vitality under the leadership of one of americas foremost republican mayors rudy giuliani 
new york city evolved from a city plagued by crime smothered by government and void of opportunity into one that attracts both families and young people looking to build careers and enjoy an urban lifestyle 
new yorks turnaround is a testament to the great power of turning republican ideals into policies and solutions 
by focusing on economic growth and opportunity business development crime control and the revitalization of urban eyesores we can inject fresh energy and opportunity into americas urban centers 
lower taxes passed by the republican congress are stimulating development and investment in cities around the country 
new homeownership opportunities are giving residents a stake in urban neighborhoods 
violent crime rates including robberies and rapes were down in 
the presidents commitment to cleaning up brownfields and making them ready for productive purposes is transforming oncecrumbling communities 
his faithbased initiative is extending the work of religious and charitable groups that operate in cities serving meals helping the homeless and providing mentors for children 
and the no child left behind law is bringing new hope to parents and students in inner city schools 
president bush is building on the successes of republican mayors who bring opportunity to inner cities 
at the same time the president is working with mayors and local leaders across america to ensure that the unprecedented homeland security funding provided by the republican congress is spent on shoring up the security of major cities and preparing first responders for any potential future attack 
by making americas cities places of opportunity and safety attractive to citizens of all backgrounds we ensure that urban centers remain vital and vibrant communities 
is a special responsibility of the federal government and should be a model for urban areas throughout the country 
the citys downhill slide was stopped in the s both through its own internal efforts and through the active intervention of congressional republicans 
the dc homebuyers tax credit helped to revitalize marginal neighborhoods and should be reinstated 
a landmark tuition assistance act opened the doors of americas public colleges and universities to residents of the district 
and thanks to president bush acting in concert with republicans in congress district elementary and high school students are now benefiting from the million dc school choice initiative the first federallyfunded school choice demonstration program 
local government reform is an issue of importance to both congress and residents of the district 
recent city administrations have made great strides in improving the operations of city government and as these efforts continue we support yielding more budgetary and legal autonomy to local elected officials 
as the seat of our federal government and a likely target of the september th attacks washington dc also plays a critical role in homeland security 
the federal government should continue to work closely with city officials to ensure maximum public safety for both residents of and visitors to the district and respect the unique budgetary constraints under which the city operates 
we support efforts to end chronic homelessness by providing support services and housing for chronically homeless individuals 
although these individuals comprise roughly ten percent of the homeless population they consume a disproportionately large share of all homeless emergency services because their housing health and other needs have not before been comprehensively addressed 
by taking on the toughest cases we can bring help and hope to individuals who may feel that society long ago left them behind 
republicans and president bush strongly support an individual right to own guns which is explicitly protected by the constitutions second amendment 
our party honors the great american tradition of hunting and we applaud efforts by the bush administration to make more public lands available to hunters to increase access to hunting clinics and safety programs for children and adults and to improve opportunities for hunting for americans with disabilities 
we believe the second amendment and all of the rights guaranteed by it should enable lawabiding citizens throughout the country to own firearms in their homes for selfdefense 
to protect the rights and safety of lawabiding citizens the congress passed and president bush signed the law enforcement officers safety act which allows active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed guns in public while offduty 
we support efforts by the administration and congress to enhance the instant background check system for gun purchases and to ensure that records of lawful transactions are destroyed in a timely manner 
we applaud congressional republicans for seeking to stop frivolous lawsuits against firearms manufacturers which is a transparent attempt to deprive citizens of their second amendment rights 
we oppose federal licensing of lawabiding gun owners and national gun registration as a violation of the second amendment and an invasion of privacy of honest citizens 
we agree that the best way to deter crime is to enforce existing laws and hand down tough penalties against anyone who commits a crime with a gun 
this approach is working 
since project safe neighborhoods was instituted in hundreds of new federal state and local prosecutors have been hired to target criminals who use guns 
prosecutions are up percent and the violent crime victimization rate is down percent 
the republican party and president bush support a federal constitutional amendment for victims of violent crime that would provide specific rights for victims protected under the us constitution 
we support courts having the option to impose the death penalty in capital murder cases 
we praise president bush and republicans in congress for the measures they have taken to protect pregnant women from violent crime by passing laci and conners law which recognizes the commonsense proposition that when a crime of violence against a pregnant woman kills or injures her unborn child there are two victims and two offenses that should be punished 
this year more than inmates will be released from prison 
studies show that without intervention approximately twothirds will likely be rearrested within three years of their release 
the president has proposed a fouryear million initiative to reduce recidivism and help released inmates contribute to their communities 
the initiative will harness the resources and experience of faithbased and community organizations in providing job training and placement services to nonviolent adult exoffenders transitional housing for up to and voluntary mentoring support for those desiring it 
drug abuse and addiction ruin lives 
there can be no debate about it 
every adult has a responsibility to teach children about the dangers of drugs in terms of both physical harm and potential death as well as lost opportunities for success 
after witnessing eight years of presidential inaction on the war against drugs during the prior administration we applaud president bush for his steady commitment to reducing drug use among teens 
the administration recently exceeded its twoyear goal of reducing drug use among young people 
the most recent survey shows an percent drop between and in the use of illicit drugs by teenagers 
among teens some drugs such as lsd have dropped to recordlow levels of use 
for other drugs we are seeing the lowest levels of use in almost a decade 
to continue this progress we must ensure that jail time is used as an effective deterrent to drug use and support the continued funding of grants to assist schools in drug testing 
at the same time we should make drug treatment available to people willing to take the courageous step of admitting they have a problem and working hard to overcome it 
the presidents access to recovery atr program is giving individuals seeking drug treatment expanded access to effective providers through a new voucher program 
the renewal of entire communities is an awesome task that involves one human face and one human heart at a time 
but the american people have a long and seasoned history of working wonders 
government does have a role to play but as a partner not a rival to the armies of compassion 
these forces have roots in the areas they serve often based in local churches synagogues mosques and temples 
their leaders are people to whom the disadvantaged are not statistics but neighbors friends and moral individuals created in the image of god 
we applaud president bushs efforts to promote the generous and compassionate work of americas faithbased and neighborhood charities 
the president established the office of faithbased and community initiatives in the white house to coordinate federal state and local efforts to tear down barriers that have prevented religiously affiliated groups from applying for government grants on an equal footing with secular organizations 
while the federal government must not promote religious activity advocate on behalf of any religion or fund any organization that discriminates on the basis of religion when providing taxpayerfunded services no organization should be disqualified from receiving federal funds simply because it displays religious symbols has a statement of faith in its mission statement or has a religious leader on its board 
as a result of the presidents leadership the federal government is ending discrimination against faithbased organizations and now welcomes these groups as partners and allies in the effort to deliver social services to people in need 
faithbased groups must show that their programs are effective at providing help whether it be serving the needs of the homeless mentoring children or helping americans who battle addiction 
faith can often be a crucial element in the struggle to overcome personal challenges and now americans have the option of receiving treatment that meets their physical as well as spiritual needs 
we commend the president for his steadfast support of people and institutions of faith and we urge the congress to act on legislative proposals to enhance privatesector works of charity and compassion 
we also affirm that the hiring rights of religious organizations must be maintained so that religious charities do not have to abandon their religious character in order to provide publicly funded services 
we support the presidents efforts to encourage volunteer service and civic involvement to strengthen our communities and our nation and to help people in need 
in the president called on all americans to dedicate at least two years or hours over the course of their lifetimes to serving others and created the usa freedom corps to strengthen americas culture of service 
today more than million americans are answering the call to serve 
the number of volunteers has increased by million since 
the new citizens corps is training people to respond to law enforcement and emergency needs in more than communities across america and peace corps enrollment is at its highest level in years 
our nation is a land of opportunity for all and our communities must represent the ideal of equality and justice for every citizen 
the republican party favors aggressive proactive measures to ensure that no individual is discriminated against on the basis of race national origin gender or other characteristics covered by our civil rights laws 
we also favor recruitment and outreach policies that cast the widest possible net so that the best qualified individuals are encouraged to apply for jobs contracts and university admissions 
we believe in the principle of affirmative access taking steps to ensure that disadvantaged individuals of all colors and ethnic backgrounds have the opportunity to compete economically and that no child is left behind educationally 
we support a reasonable approach to title ix that seeks to expand opportunities for women without adversely affecting mens athletics 
we praise president bush for his strong record on civil rights enforcement and for becoming the first president ever to ban racial profiling by the federal government 
finally because we are opposed to discrimination we reject preferences quotas and setasides based on skin color ethnicity or gender which perpetuate divisions and can lead people to question the accomplishments of successful minorities and women 
the foundation of our democratic republic is our commitment to conducting free and fair elections 
unfortunately in november too many people believed they were denied the right to vote 
many african americans hispanics and others fear they may lose the right to vote because of inaccurate or insecure technology or because of a rolling back in the gains made by the passage of civil rights legislation 
our national commitment to a voting process that has integrity was underscored in when the congress passed and the president signed the help america vote act hava 
we will continue to do all we can to ensure that every lawful vote counts for all americans 
we support the new freedom initiative president bushs plan for fully integrating americans with disabilities into all aspects of american life 
the new freedom initiative is helping americans with disabilities by increasing access to assistive technologies expanding educational opportunities increasing the ability of americans with disabilities to integrate into the workforce and promoting increased access into daily community life 
these are strong efforts to help americans with disabilities lead independent fulfilling lives 
we applaud the president and congress for increasing funding for the individuals with disabilities education act idea which requires that eligible students with disabilities be provided a free appropriate public education 
we also endorse efforts to protect children and their parents from being coerced into administering a controlled substance in order to attend school 
the federal government has a special responsibility ethical and legal to make the american dream accessible to native americans 
unfortunately the resources that the united states holds in trust for them financial and otherwise have been misused and abused 
while many tribes have become energetic participants in the mainstream of american life the serious social ills afflicting some reservations have been worsened by decades of mismanagement from washington 
•tribal governments are best situated to gauge the needs of their communities and members 
•political selfdetermination and economic selfsufficiency are twin pillars of an effective indian policy 
•private sector initiatives rather than public assistance can best improve material conditions in indian communities 
•high taxes and unreasonable regulations stifle new and expanded businesses and thwart the creation of job opportunities and prosperity 
we will continue to work with the bureau of indian affairs to make the tribal recognition process more transparent 
we will strengthen native american selfdetermination by respecting tribal sovereignty encouraging economic development on native lands and working with them to reorganize the bureau of indian affairs and the indian health service 
we applaud president bush for keeping his promise to eliminate within five years the maintenance and repairs backlog afflicting indian schools 
this promise will be achieved in only four years with funding in the budget 
we support efforts to provide higher quality health care through the indian health service 
we uphold the unique governmenttogovernment relationship between the tribes and the united states and honor our nations trust obligations to them 
we support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by native americans native alaskans and native hawaiians and to preserve their cultures and languages 
in an age of new threats we recognize the critical role tribes play in securing our homeland and contributing to our national defense 
we honor the sacrifices made by native americans serving in the military today 
they are upholding the high ideal of service on behalf of liberty 
we will ensure that indian veterans receive the care and respect they have earned through their service to america 
in the federal courts scores of judges with activist backgrounds in the hardleft now have lifetime tenure 
recent events have made it clear that these judges threaten americas dearest institutions and our very way of life 
in some states activist judges are redefining the institution of marriage 
the pledge of allegiance has already been invalidated by the courts once and the supreme courts ruling has left the pledge in danger of being struck down again not because the american people have rejected it and the values that it embodies but because a handful of activist judges threaten to overturn commonsense and tradition 
and while the vast majority of americans support a ban on partial birth abortion this brutal and violent practice will likely continue by judicial fiat 
we believe that the selfproclaimed supremacy of these judicial activists is antithetical to the democratic ideals on which our nation was founded 
president bush has established a solid record of nominating only judges who have demonstrated respect for the constitution and the democratic processes of our republic and republicans in the senate have strongly supported those nominees 
we call upon obstructionist democrats in the senate to abandon their unprecedented and highly irresponsible filibuster of president bushs highly qualified judicial nominees and to allow the republican party to restore respect for the law to americas courts 
the sound principle of judicial review has turned into an intolerable presumption of judicial supremacy 
a republican congress working with a republican president will restore the separation of powers and reestablish a government of law 
there are different ways to achieve that goal such as using article iii of the constitution to limit federal court jurisdiction for example in instances where judges are abusing their power by banning the use of under god in the pledge of allegiance or prohibiting depictions of the ten commandments and potential actions invalidating the defense of marriage act doma 
additionally we condemn judicial activists and their unwarranted and unconstitutional restrictions on the free exercise of religion in the public square 
hivaids is one of the deadliest epidemics in human history 
an estimated million people worldwide are living with hivaids and more than million people have died as a result of the disease 
this disease has created an estimated million hivaids orphans children who have lost at least one parent to hivaids 
nearly one million americans are believed to be infected with hiv 
we fully support the presidents leadership in dramatically expanding resources to find an hivaids vaccine and in devoting at least billion over five years towards global prevention care and treatment programs 
since taking office president bush has virtually tripled the united states annual financial commitment to the global war on hivaids 
we support the emphasis on prevention in the presidents emergency plan for hivaids relief and endorse its embrace of the successful ugandan model promoting the abc approach to prevention that encourages abstinence and being faithful to one lifetime partner along with other behavioral changes intended to eliminate or reduce exposure risk 
we support the presidents advancing hiv prevention initiative that emphasizes routine testing early diagnosis ongoing monitoring and elimination of hivaids in newborn babies and infants 
we also support the presidents efforts to double the amount spent on abstinenceonly education and to promote healthy relationships 
we recognize the unique and special vulnerability of women and girls to hiv infection from abusive and coercive behavior beyond their control and encourage expanded efforts to address this problem through legal and cultural reform 
we also support more efforts to eradicate sex trafficking and prostitution and their underlying causes 
we support the expansion of programs providing support for those orphaned by hivaids 
we fully support the use of faithbased organizations as partners on the ground in hivaids relief efforts because they often have the most capability credibility and conviction for performing this important work in different communities regions and countries 
we also believe treatment and prevention of drug abuse are essential components of hiv protection 
we commend the president for his support of the ryan white care act and call for its reauthorization 
we believe that ensuring access to treatment must be the priority of hivaids care programs 
the presidents policy is to provide safe effective high quality hivaids drugs at the lowest possible cost 
he has accelerated the fda review process for hivaids drugs and therapies for use under the emergency plan for hivaids relief 
president bush led the g in endorsing the establishment of a global hiv vaccine enterprise a virtual consortium to accelerate hiv vaccine development 
the president also announced plans to establish a second hiv vaccine research and development center in the us in addition to the one at the national institutes of health 
the new center will become a key component of the global hiv vaccine enterprise 
we welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by americans residing in guam the virgin islands american samoa the northern marianas and puerto rico 
since no single approach can meet the needs of those diverse communities we emphasize respect for their wishes regarding their relationship to the rest of the union 
we affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution with all the rights and responsibilities it entails 
we support the native american samoans efforts to preserve their culture and landtenure system which fosters selfreliance and strong extendedfamily values 
we support increased local selfgovernment for the united states citizens of the virgin islands and closer cooperation between the local and federal governments to promote private sectorled development and selfsufficiency 
we recognize that guam is a strategically vital us territory in the far western pacific an american fortress in the asian region 
we affirm our support for the patriotic us citizens of guam to achieve greater local selfgovernment an improved federalterritorial relationship new economic development strategies and continued selfdetermination as desired with respect to political status 
we support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine 
we recognize that congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for puerto rico to achieve a permanent nonterritorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement 
as long as puerto rico is not a state however the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the united states government 
the republican party supports reforming the immigration system to ensure that it is legal safe orderly and humane 
it also supports measures to ensure that the immigration system is structured to address the needs of national security 
america is a stronger and better nation because of the hard work and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants and the republican party honors them 
a growing economy requires a growing number of workers and president bush has proposed a new temporary worker program that applies when no americans can be found to fill the jobs 
this new program would allow workers who currently hold jobs to come out of the shadows and to participate legally in americas economy 
it would allow men and women who enter the program to apply for citizenship in the same manner as those who apply from outside the united states 
there must be strong workplace enforcement with tough penalties against employees and employers who violate immigration laws 
we oppose amnesty because it would have the effect of encouraging illegal immigration and would give an unfair advantage to those who have broken our laws 
to better ensure that immigrants enter the united states only through legal means that allow for verification of their identity reconnaissance cameras border patrol agents and unmanned aerial flights have all been increased at the border 
in addition border patrol agents now have sweeping new powers to deport illegal aliens without having first to go through the cumbersome process of allowing the illegal alien to have a hearing before an immigration judge 
we support these efforts to enforce the law while welcoming immigrants who enter america through legal avenues 
we are living in a time of great change in our world in our economy in science and medicine 
yet some things endure courage and compassion reverence and integrity respect for differences of faith and race 
the values we try to live by never change 
and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such as families and schools and religious congregations 
these institutions these unseen pillars of civilization must remain strong in america and we will defend them 
we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy responsible children ” 
families are the cornerstone of our culture the building blocks of a strong society 
in families children learn values and ideals as well as the basic lessons that get them started on a lifelong path of education 
we believe that every child deserves the chance to be born and grow up in a loving family 
we also believe that while families exist in many different forms there are ideals to strive for 
evidence shows us that children have the best chance at success when raised by a mother and a father who love and respect each other as well as their children 
we also know that family breakdown makes america less stable 
to create a sturdy foundation for the strength and success of our citizens and our nation republicans support policies that promote strong families 
we also support a government that makes it easier for parents to raise their children in a world that offers unprecedented opportunities and new challenges 
we offer an approach based on our common values and our common hopes 
it will lead to a better america one family at a time 
in the republican congress made history by passing welfare reform that revolutionized the way the government helps people build better lives for themselves 
the federal government gave states the flexibility to manage the temporary assistance for needy families program and both states and federal authorities began treating welfare as a step up rather than a way of life 
since the republicanled law welfare caseloads have declined by half and nearly three million americans have been lifted out of poverty 
but there is more work to do 
we need to build on the results of the reforms and continue to move welfare recipients into jobs and off the welfare rolls 
this is especially important for single women and mothers who continue to rely on welfare and fear that they can not find a job or enter a training program because they need to care for their children 
we endorse president bushs plan to extend the benefits of welfare reform by strengthening work requirements and promoting healthy marriages and offering training transportation and child care services to help people become selfsufficient 
every american deserves a chance to know the pride of earning a paycheck and providing for his or her family 
we support the presidents welfare reform proposals that promote child wellbeing and stronger marriages 
we recognize the importance of having in the home a father and a mother who are married 
the twoparent family still provides the best environment of stability discipline responsibility and character 
we recognize that fathers play a critical role in providing stability for their children 
studies show that children are much more likely to do well in school and avoid crime and drugs when they have a responsible father in their lives 
promoting responsible fatherhood will have longlasting benefits for families and for communities 
we support president bushs initiatives to reaffirm the important role fathers play in their childrens lives and to help men meet the responsibilities of fatherhood 
we support the presidents strong efforts to promote adoption through increased tax incentives and bonuses to states that place older children in permanent family homes as well as his efforts to promote foster care by increasing the allocation of funds for preventive and family services 
childrens health remains a top priority for every family and for our country 
despite advances in medicine environmental progress and increased efforts to keep children safe at home and in communities alarming trends in overweight children and childhood obesity jeopardize the health of millions of children 
too many of americas youth do not exercise are overweight and have poor dietary habits 
this leads to complications in childhood and as adults 
five chronic diseases associated with obesity heart disease cancer stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease such as bronchitis emphysema and asthma and diabetes account for more than twothirds of all deaths in the united states 
extensive research much of it conducted or funded by the federal government has shown that improving overall health and thus preventing disease and premature death is as easy as making small adjustments and improvements in the activities of daily life 
we applaud the presidents effort to increase public awareness about the benefits of physical fitness through programs like healthierus which focuses on physical activity a nutritious diet medical screenings and healthy choices and verb which encourages young people to be physically active every day 
each year more than three million american teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases causing emotional harm and serious health consequences even death 
we support efforts to educate teens and parents about the health risks associated with early sexual activity and provide the tools needed to help teens make healthy choices 
abstinence from sexual activity is the only protection that is percent effective against outofwedlock pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases including sexually transmitted hivaids 
therefore we support doubling abstinence education funding 
we oppose schoolbased clinics that provide referrals counseling and related services for contraception and abortion 
we oppose schoolbased mental health programs that include recommendations for the use of psychotropic drugs 
the president and republicans in congress are working to provide privatesector workers the same flexible scheduling options that government employees already enjoy 
now that more families have both parents in the workforce american workers need more control over their work schedules 
more flexibility in the workplace will help americans to better manage the demands of work and family 
and that will make families stronger 
comptime and flextime enable employees to choose paid time off as an alternative to overtime pay 
both of these programs would be voluntary to employees and would include employee protections to prevent employers from coercing or forcing employees to take time off in lieu of receiving overtime pay 
president bush created the national do not call registry a tool that will help ensure that telemarketers respect the privacy of our nations citizens 
it will allow people to limit most unwanted telemarketing calls by registering their home or cell phone numbers 
registration can be completed by phone or over the internet and it is free of charge 
the service also comes at no expense to the taxpayers 
unauthorized and unwelcome email commonly known as spam interferes with efficient and effective business and family communications 
we support efforts to address this growing problem 
identity theft is one of the fastest growing financial crimes in our nation 
last year alone nearly million americans had their identities stolen by criminals who robbed them and the nations businesses of nearly billion through fraudulent transactions 
the crime of identity theft undermines the basic trust on which our economy depends 
and like other forms of stealing identity theft leaves the victim poorer and feeling terribly violated 
we praise president bush and republicans in congress for passing the fair and accurate credit transactions act which established a national system of fraud detection so that identity thieves can be stopped before they run up tens of thousands of dollars in illegal purchases 
thanks to this law victims can make one phone call to report the crime to alert all three major credit rating agencies and to protect their credit ratings 
we further praise president bush and republicans in congress for passing the identity theft penalty enhancement act which provides a real deterrent by toughening the prison sentences for those who use identity theft to commit other crimes including terrorism 
it reflects our governments resolve to answer serious offenses with serious penalties 
and we praise president bush for the broader effort he has waged to prevent identity theft 
the us postal inspection service the fbi and secret service are working with local and state officials to crack down on the criminal networks that are responsible for much of the identity theft that occurs in america 
the federal trade commission is training local law enforcement in the detection of identity theft and has set up the id theft data clearinghouse which keeps track of complaints across the country and provides those records to prosecutors seeking to take down organized identity theft rings 
as stated earlier we applaud efforts to promote school choice initiatives that give parents more control over their childrens education 
by the same token we defend the option for home schooling and call for vigilant enforcement of laws designed to protect family rights and privacy in education 
children should not be compelled to answer offensive or intrusive questionnaires 
we will continue to work for the return of voluntary school prayer to our schools and will strongly enforce the republican legislation that guarantees equal access to school facilities by student religious groups 
we strongly support voluntary studentinitiated prayer in school without governmental interference 
we strongly disagree with the supreme courts rulings against studentinitiated prayer 
the republican party shares the position of the united states supreme court in miller v california us that obscene material is unprotected by the first amendment us at and that to equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand conception of the first amendment and its high purposes in the historic struggle for freedom ” miller us at 
we applaud the congress for passing and the president for signing the protect act 
as the president said this law will greatly assist law enforcement in tracking criminals who would harm our children and will greatly help in rescuing the youngest victims of crime 
the law formally established a national amber alert coordinator in the department of justice to help facilitate efforts to find missing children 
it also added important tools to fight child exploitation by making obscene images of children even those created with computer technology illegal 
we agree that strengthening the laws against child abuse will protect our children help preserve the family structure and promote a healthy environment in which our children can grow 
with ever more children accessing material over the internet we support efforts to bolster online protections that prevent children from being exposed to pornographic images and solicitations 
and we applaud public and private efforts to create online safe areas for children 
we praise president bush and congressional republicans for their leadership in passing the dot kids implementation and efficiency act which created a secure domain on the internet where parents know that it is safe for their children to learn and play and explore 
we strongly support president bushs call for a constitutional amendment that fully protects marriage and we believe that neither federal nor state judges nor bureaucrats should force states to recognize other living arrangements as equivalent to marriage 
we believe and the social science confirms that the wellbeing of children is best accomplished in the environment of the home nurtured by their mother and father anchored by the bonds of marriage 
we further believe that legal recognition and the accompanying benefits afforded couples should be preserved for that unique and special union of one man and one woman which has historically been called marriage 
after more than two centuries of american jurisprudence and millennia of human experience a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization the union of a man and a woman in marriage 
attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country and anything less than a constitutional amendment passed by the congress and ratified by the states is vulnerable to being overturned by activist judges 
on a matter of such importance the voice of the people must be heard 
the constitutional amendment process guarantees that the final decision will rest with the american people and their elected representatives 
president bush will also vigorously defend the defense of marriage act which was supported by both parties and passed by votes in the senate 
this common sense law reaffirms the right of states not to recognize samesex marriages licensed in other states 
president bush said we will not stand for judges who undermine democracy by legislating from the bench and try to remake america by court order 
the republican house of representatives has responded to this challenge by passing hr a bill to withdraw jurisdiction from the federal courts over the defense of marriage act 
we urge congress to use its article iii power to enact this into law so that activist federal judges can not force other states to approve and recognize massachusetts attempt to redefine marriage 
as a country we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the declaration of independence 
that is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed 
we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children 
our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions 
we oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it 
we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life 
our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support material and otherwise they need for themselves and for their babies not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion 
we oppose abortion but our prolife agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion 
we salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services and we commend congressional republicans for expanding assistance to adopting families and for removing racial barriers to adoption 
we join the president in supporting crisis pregnancy programs and parental notification laws 
and we applaud president bush for allowing states to extend health care coverage to unborn children 
we praise the president for his bold leadership in defense of life 
we praise him for signing the born alive infants protection act 
this important legislation ensures that every infant born alive including an infant who survives an abortion procedure is considered a person under federal law 
we praise republicans in congress for passing with strong bipartisan support a ban on the inhumane procedure known as partial birth abortion 
and we applaud president bush for signing legislation outlawing partial birth abortion and for vigorously defending it in the courts 
in signing the partial birth abortion ban president bush reminded us that the most basic duty of government is to defend the life of the innocent 
every person however frail or vulnerable has a place and a purpose in this world 
we affirm the inherent dignity and worth of all people 
we oppose the nonconsensual withholding of care or treatment because of disability age or infirmity just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide which especially endanger the poor and those on the margins of society 
we support president bushs decision to restore the drug enforcement administrations policy that controlled substances shall not be used for assisted suicide 
we applaud congressional republicans for their leadership against those abuses and their pioneering legislation to focus research and treatment resources on the alleviation of pain and the care of terminally ill patients 
for years our party has found its purpose in its principles 
we confront big challenges instead of passing them on to future generations 
we move forward with needed reforms to make the government work better for citizens 
we fight important battles and champion freedom because by expanding liberty we make our nation more secure 
this is the choice the american people face moving forward or looking back reforming government or settling for the status quo producing results or playing politics 
as republicans we know who we are and what we believe 
as the party of the open door while steadfast in our commitment to our ideals we respect and accept that members of our party can have deeply held and sometimes differing views 
this diversity is a source of strength not a sign of weakness and so we welcome into our ranks all who may hold differing positions 
we commit to resolve our differences with civility trust and mutual respect and to affirm the common goals and beliefs that unite us 
as the party of lincoln we stand for freedom 
we stand for the freedom of families and individuals to have good schools good health care and affordable housing and services 
we stand for the freedom that comes with a good paying job in a growing economy 
we stand for the freedom and dignity of every human life in every stage of life 
we know that freedom is not americas gift to the world freedom is the almightys gift to every man woman and child in the world 
and we stand for a hopeful tomorrow that will come from total and complete victory in the war on terror 
these are values worthy of a great nation 
and they are values worth fighting for 
he is protecting us from danger by being prepared strong and steadfast 
vigilance is never easy 
but it is always essential now more than ever 
george w bush has done the hard work and made the hard choices required of an american president in challenging times 
because of his leadership we are strong 
because of his vision we will be even stronger 
that is the pledge of this platform … and the promise of this convention
