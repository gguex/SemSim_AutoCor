in democrats meet in philadelphia with the same basic belief that animated the continental congress when they gathered here years ago out of many we are one 
under president obamas leadership 
and thanks to the hard work and determination of the american people we have come a long way from the great recession and the republican policies that triggered it 
american businesses have now added million jobs since privatesector job growth turned positive in early 
twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage 
the american auto industry just had its best year ever 
and we are getting more of our energy from the sun and wind and importing less oil from overseas 
but too many americans have been left out and left behind 
they are working longer hours with less security 
wages have barely budged 
and the racial wealth gap remains wide 
while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise 
and for too many families the dream of homeownership is out of reach 
as working people struggle the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power 
republicans in congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face 
its no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them 
democrats believe that cooperation is better than conflict 
unity is better than division 
empowerment is better than resentment 
and bridges are better than walls 
its a simple but powerful idea we are stronger together 
democrats believe we are stronger when we have an economy that works for everyone 
an economy that grows incomes for working people 
creates goodpaying jobs 
and puts a middleclass life within reach for more americans 
democrats believe we can spur more sustainable economic growth 
which will create goodpaying jobs and raise wages 
and we can have more economic fairness 
so the rewards are shared broadly not just with those at the top 
we need an economy that prioritizes longterm investment over shortterm profitseeking 
rewards the common interest over selfinterest 
and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship 
we believe that todays extreme level of income and wealth inequalitywhere the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest people in our country own more wealth than the bottom millionmakes our economy weaker 
our communities poorer 
and our politics poisonous 
and we know that our nations long struggle with race is far from over 
more than half a century after rosa parks sat and dr king marched and john lewis bled more than half a century after césar chávez dolores huerta and larry itliong organized race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in america and who gets left behind 
we must face that reality and we must fix it 
we believe a good education is a basic right of all americans no matter what zip code they live in 
we will end the schooltoprison pipeline and build a cradletocollege pipeline instead where every child can live up to his or her godgiven potential 
we believe in helping americans balance work and family without fear of punishment or penalty 
we believe in at last guaranteeing equal pay for women 
and as the party that created social security we believe in protecting every americans right to retire with dignity 
we firmly believe that the greed recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street must be brought to an end 
wall street must never again be allowed to threaten families and businesses on main street 
democrats believe we are stronger when we protect citizens right to vote while stopping corporations outsized influence in elections 
we will fight to end the broken campaign finance system 
overturn the disastrous citizens united decision 
restore the full power of the voting rights act 
and return control of our elections to the american people 
democrats believe that climate change poses a real and urgent threat to our economy our national security and our childrens health and futures 
and that americans deserve the jobs and security that come from becoming the clean energy superpower of the st century 
democrats believe we are stronger and safer when america brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose 
we believe we should strengthen our alliances not weaken them 
we believe in the power of development and diplomacy 
we believe our military should be the besttrained bestequipped fighting force in the world 
and that we must do everything we can to honor and support our veterans 
and we know that only the united states can mobilize common action on a truly global scale to take on the challenges that transcend borders from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics 
above all democrats are the party of inclusion 
we know that diversity is not our problemit is our promise 
as democrats we respect differences of perspective and belief and pledge to work together to move this country forward even when we disagree 
with this platform we do not merely seek common groundwe strive to reach higher ground 
we are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants 
we know that todays immigrants are tomorrows teachers doctors lawyers government leaders soldiers entrepreneurs activists pta members and pillars of our communities 
we believe in protecting civil liberties and guaranteeing civil rights and voting rights womens rights and workers rights lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities 
we believe america is still as robert kennedy said a great country an unselfish country and a compassionate country 
these principles stand in sharp contrast to the republicans 
who have nominated as the standardbearer for their party and their candidate for president a man who seeks to appeal to americans basest differences rather than our better natures 
the stakes have been high in previous elections 
but in the stakes can be measured in human livesin the number of immigrants who would be torn from their homes 
in the number of faithful and peaceful muslims who would be barred from even visiting our shores 
in the number of allies alienated and dictators courted 
in the number of americans who would lose access to health care and see their rights ripped away 
this election is about more than democrats and republicans 
it is about who we are as a nation and who we will be in the future 
two hundred and forty years ago in philadelphia we started a revolution of ideas and of action that continues to this day 
since then our union has been tested many times through bondage and civil war segregation and depression two world wars and the threat of nuclear annihilation 
generations of americans fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of opportunity and dignityand we are fighting still 
despite what some say america is and has always been greatbut not because it has been perfect 
what makes america great is our unerring belief that we can make it better 
we can and we will build a more just economy 
a more equal society 
and a more perfect unionbecause we are stronger together 
democrats believe we must break down all the barriers holding americans back 
and restore the basic bargain that built americas mighty middle class 
if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead and stay ahead 
the system is not working when we have a rigged economy in which ordinary americans work longer hours for lower wages 
while most new income and wealth goes to the top one percent 
republican governors legislatures and their corporate allies have launched attack after attack on workers fundamental rights to organize and bargain collectively 
too many americans are living paycheck to paycheck 
and hallmarks of a middle class lifeowning a home 
having access to affordable and quality childcare 
retiring with dignity 
feel out of reach 
it is no wonder so many americans feel like the deck is stacked against them 
the democratic party believes that supporting workers through higher wages 
workplace protections 
policies to balance work and family 
and other investments will help rebuild the middle class for the st century 
democrats believe that the current minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage 
no one who works full time should have to raise a family in poverty 
we believe that americans should earn at least an hour 
and have the right to form or join a union 
and will work in every way we canin congress and the federal government in states and with the private sectorto reach this goal 
we should raise the federal minimum wage to an hour over time and index it 
give all americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work 
and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least an hour 
we applaud the approaches taken by states like new york and california 
we also support creating one fair wage for all workers by ending the subminimum wage for tipped workers and people with disabilities 
democrats support a model employer executive order or some other vehicle to leverage federal dollars to support employers who provide their workers with a living wage 
good benefits 
and the opportunity to form a union without reprisal 
the one trillion dollars spent annually by the government on contracts loans and grants should be used to support good jobs that rebuild the middle class 
the democratic party believes that when workers are strong america is strong 
democrats will make it easier for workers public and private to exercise their right to organize and join unions 
we will fight to pass laws that direct the national labor relations board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards 
as well as laws that bring companies to the negotiating table 
we support binding arbitration to help workers who have voted to join a union reach a first contract 
a major factor in the year decline in the middle class is that the rights of workers to bargain collectively for better wages and benefits have been under attack at all levels 
donald trump would make matters worse by creating a race to the bottom where the middle class is fighting over fewer and fewer goodpaying jobs 
in fact trump rejected some attempts by his own employees to unionize 
and has personally hired unionbusting firms to undermine workers rights 
democrats believe socalled right to work laws are wrong for workerssuch as teachers and other public employees who serve our communities every dayand wrong for america 
we will continue to vigorously oppose those laws and other efforts that would eliminate dues checkoff procedures 
rollback prevailing wage standards 
abolish fair share requirements 
restrict the use of voluntary membership payments for political purposes 
attack seniority restrict due process protections 
and require annual recertification efforts 
we oppose legislation and lawsuits that would strike down laws protecting the rights of teachers and other public employees 
we will defend president obamas overtime rule which protects of millions of workers by paying them fairly for their hard work 
the democratic party believes consumers workers students retirees and investors who have been mistreated should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law 
that is why we will support efforts to limit the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts which unfairly strip consumers workers students retirees and investors of their right to their day in court 
we will fight to secure equal pay for women which will benefit all women and their families 
particularly women of color who are disproportionately impacted by discriminatory pay practices and against other factors that contribute to the wage gap 
and we will combat the discrimination they face on and off the job 
while donald trump thinks it is dangerous for women to leave the home and paid family leave hurts our economy 
democrats will make sure that the united states finally enacts national paid family and medical leave by passing a family and medical leave act that would provide all workers at least weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or address a personal or family members serious health issue 
we will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave 
we will also encourage employers to provide paid vacation 
our work and family policies must also help family caregivers 
we will ensure that family caregivers have the support respite care and training they need to support their loved ones 
we will create a strong stable paid caregiving workforce to help meet families needs by raising wages improving access to training and giving workers the opportunity to come together to make their voices heard in support of a stronger system 
we will address the conditions that make it hard for workers with unpredictable or inflexible schedules to meet caregiving responsibilities 
we will take steps to expand and strengthen the home care workforce 
we will increase investments to make quality childcare more affordable 
boost wages for childcare workers 
and support the millions of people paying for coordinating or providing care for aging relatives or those with disabilities 
corporate profits are at nearrecord highs 
but workers have not shared through rising wages 
profitsharing is linked to higher pay and productivity 
that is why working with business labor and other stakeholders 
we will incentivize companies to share profits with their employees on top of wages and pay increases 
while targeting the workers and businesses that need profitsharing the most 
whereas the republican presidential nominee rooted for the housing crisis 
democrats will continue to fight for those families who suffered the loss of their homes 
we will help those who are working toward a path of financial stability and will put sustainable home ownership into the reach of more families 
democrats will also combat the affordable housing crisis and skyrocketing rents in many parts of the country 
which is leading too many families and workers to be pushed out of communities where they work 
we will preserve and increase the supply of affordable rental housing by expanding incentives to ease local barriers to building new affordable rental housing developments in areas of economic opportunity 
we will substantially increase funding for the national housing trust fund to construct preserve and rehabilitate millions of affordable housing rental units 
not only will this help address the affordable housing crisis it will also create millions of goodpaying jobs in the process 
democrats believe that we should provide more federal resources to the people struggling most with unaffordable housing lowincome families people with disabilities veterans and the elderly 
we will expand efforts to address the lingering effects of the foreclosure crisis through programs like the federal neighborhood stabilization program 
we will also expand programs to prevent displacement of existing residents 
especially in communities of color 
create affordable and workforce housing 
and preserve neighborhoodserving nonprofit organizations and small businesses 
we will reinvigorate housing production programs repair public housing and increase funding for the housing choice voucher program and other rental assistance programs 
and we will fight for robust funding to end homelessness in our cities and counties once and for all through targeted investments to provide the necessary outreach social services and housing options for all populations experiencing homelessness 
we will engage in a stronger more coordinated and better funded partnership among federal state and local governments to end chronic homelessness for millions of americans 
we will build on and expand president obamas promising initiatives to end veteran and family homelessness in our country 
we must make sure that everyone has a fair shot at homeownership 
we will keep the housing market robust and inclusive by supporting more firsttime homebuyers and putting more americans into the financial position to become sustainable homeowners 
preserving the year fixed rate mortgage modernizing credit scoring clarifying lending rules expanding access to housing counseling defending and strengthening the fair housing act 
and ensuring that regulators have the clear direction resources and authority to enforce those rules effectively 
we will prevent predatory lending by defending the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb 
these steps are especially important because over the next decade most new households will be formed by families in communities of color which typically have less generational wealth and fewer resources to put towards a down payment 
democrats are proud to be the party that created social security one of the nations most successful and effective programs 
without social security nearly half of americas seniors would be living in poverty 
social security is more than just a retirement program 
it also provides important life insurance to young survivors of deceased workers and provides disability insurance protection 
we will fight every effort to cut privatize or weaken social security including attempts to raise the retirement age diminish benefits by cutting costofliving adjustments or reducing earned benefits 
democrats will expand social security so that every american can retire with dignity and respect 
including women who are widowed or took time out of the workforce to care for their children aging parents or ailing family members 
the democratic party recognizes that the way social security costof living adjustments are calculated may not always reflect the spending patterns of seniors particularly the disproportionate amount they spend on health care expenses 
we are committed to exploring alternatives that could better and more equitably serve seniors 
we will make sure social securitys guaranteed benefits continue for generations to come by asking those at the top to pay more 
and will achieve this goal by taxing some of the income of people above 
the democratic party is also committed to providing all necessary financial support for the social security administration so that it can provide timely benefits and highquality service for those it serves 
our plan contrasts starkly with donald trump 
he has referred to social security as a ponzi scheme and has called for privatizing it as well as increasing the retirement age 
democrats believe it should be easier for americans to save for retirement and prepare for unforeseen risks and expenses 
we will defend the right of workers to collect their defined benefit pensions and make sure workers get priority and protection when pension plans are in distress 
democrats will also fight to enact legislation to make sure that the earned pension benefits of americans will not be cut 
and will pay for it by closing tax loopholes that benefit millionaires and billionaires 
we will fight against any attempt by republicans in congress or on wall street to roll back the conflict of interest rule which requires that retirement advisors put the best interests of their clients above their own financial gain 
seniors should not have to choose between putting food on the table keeping a roof over their heads or buying the medication that they need to stay healthy 
we strongly support the older americans act which funds critical programs to help seniors remain independent in their own homes and communities 
we are also committed to fighting the immense problem of elder abuse neglect and exploitation 
the united states postal service usps is a national treasure 
that is why democrats embrace a vibrant public postal service that offers universal service and reject any effort to privatize or marginalize it 
we are committed to eliminating the unsustainable mandate to prefund retiree health costs 
and we will work to restore service to appropriate levels including overnight delivery of firstclass mail and periodicals within the same metropolitan area maintaining sixday and doortodoor delivery and appointing members to the board of governors and the postal regulatory commission who champion a strong public postal service 
democrats also advocate for expanding postal services 
this includes offering basic financial services such as paycheck cashing and removing statutory restraints on services the usps may offer 
it also includes promoting votebymail to increase voter participation and to help address the scourge of voter suppression 
democrats know that nothing is more important than creating goodpaying jobs that can support a middleclass life 
from nurses firefighters and teachers to construction workers factory workers and small business owners 
that is why we are committed to doing everything we can to build a fullemployment economy where everyone has a job that pays enough to raise a family and live in dignity with a sense of purpose 
democrats will build strong sustained shared economic growth 
we know that when americans come together we can do amazing things 
in the last century our leaders came together across the aisle to electrify the nation build the interstate highway system support groundbreaking research in medicine science and communications and send a man to the moon 
when we are bold and ambitious we can do big things and make our economy stronger for decades to come 
if we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need major federal investments to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure 
and put millions of americans back to work in decent paying jobs in both the public and private sectors 
the climate emergency 
and the need to expand the middle class 
demand that we make the most ambitious investment in american infrastructure since president eisenhower created the interstate highway system 
we will put americans to work updating and expanding our roads bridges public transit airports and passenger and freight rail lines 
we will build st century energy and water systems modernize our schools and continue to support the expansion of highspeed broadband networks 
we will protect communities from the impact of climate change and help them to mitigate its effects by investing in green and resilient infrastructure 
we will address the backlog of deferred maintenance in our four key public land management agencies 
and we will protect public health and safety by modernizing drinking and wastewater systems 
these investments will create secure goodpaying middleclass jobs today and will substantially increase demand for americanmade steel and other products manufactured in the united states 
and by boosting economic growth in a fair and equitable way and strengthening our longterm competitiveness these investments will create many more jobs in the years to come 
democrats will also create an independent national infrastructure bank that will support critical infrastructure improvements 
this bank will provide loans and other financial assistance for investments in energy water broadband transportation and multimodal infrastructure projects 
democrats will continue to support the interest tax exemption on municipal bonds and will work to establish a permanent version of build america bonds as an additional tool to encourage infrastructure investment by state and local governments 
furthermore democrats will fight to ensure resources and programs are adequately targeted to provide economic development job training and critical infrastructure investment in areas of the greatest need 
democrats believe one of the best ways to innovate prosper and create goodpaying jobs is to make more in america which is why we firmly support american manufacturing with a make it in america plan 
we must revitalize hardhit manufacturing communities 
create thriving hubs of manufacturing and innovation throughout the country 
and claw back tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas using the proceeds to reinvest in communities and workers at home instead 
democrats are proud of rescuing the auto industry from collapse which saved more than a million jobs and led the auto industry which is at the heart of american manufacturing to record sales 
democrats will defend the exportimport bank which supports goodpaying jobs across the country and allows american workers and manufacturers to compete on a level playing field 
donald trump may talk tough but he has consistently outsourced his own products 
american workers deserve better 
we must help american workers and businesses compete for jobs and investments in global clean energy hightech products internet technology products and advanced manufacturing and vehicles 
we must make american manufacturing more internationally competitive by making it the greenest and most efficient in the world including by investing in industrial energy efficiency 
democrats support ambitious public and private investments in science technology and research 
we are focused on creating good jobs in communities across america 
entrepreneurship and innovation are fundamental to our future economic growthin the information technology it industry as well as energy manufacturing transportation health retail services and countless other sectors 
we will nurture the next generation of scientists engineers and entrepreneurs 
especially women and people of color 
to make sure america continues to outcompete and outinnovate the rest of the world with our bold innovation agenda 
new technologies are already transforming our economy and they have the power to generate trillions in economic output 
we must harness these forces so that they create higherpaying jobs across the country 
bring more people into the workforce 
and reduce inequality 
to do this we need to educate our people 
and train our workforce 
support entrepreneurship 
and promote inclusion in the digital economy 
attract and retain talented people from all over the world 
and invest in research and development innovation hubs as well as in getting ideas to market 
we also need to ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn computer science by the time they graduate from high school 
democrats believe we must harness the promise of technological innovation to promote community participation 
and enhance opportunities to achieve greater economic selfsufficiency for people with disabilities 
we will encourage technology transfer entrepreneurship and small business creation throughout the country and in all types of innovation sectors 
highspeed internet connectivity is not a luxury it is a necessity for st century economic success social mobility education health care and public safety 
despite considerable progress and private investment in the last eight years to close the digital divide there is more work to do 
democrats will finish the job of connecting every household in america to highspeed broadband increase internet adoption and help hook up anchor institutions so they can offer free wifi to the public 
we will take action to help america widely deploy g technologythe next generation wireless service that will not only bring faster internet connections to underserved areas but will enable the internet of things and a host of transformative technologies 
democrats support a free and open internet at home and abroad and will oppose any effort by republicans to roll back the historic net neutrality rules that the federal communications commission enacted last year 
democrats value american innovation and believe it is one of our countrys great strengths 
we will protect the intellectual property rights of artists creators and inventors at home and abroad 
the entire nation prospers when we promote the unique and original artistic and cultural contributions of the women and men who create and preserve our nations heritage 
democrats will fight against unfair theft of intellectual property and trade secrets 
we will increase access to global markets for american intellectual property and other digital trade by opposing quotas discriminatory measures and data localization requirements 
pushing beyond the boundaries of what we know is core to who we are as americans 
democrats are immensely proud of all that the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has donethrough its achievements in science technology and explorationto better understand our place in the universe 
and inspire and educate generations of young people in this country to pursue careers in science 
space exploration is a reminder that our capacity for curiosity is limitless and may be matched only by our ability to achieve great things if we work together 
democrats believe in continuing the spirit of discovery that has animated nasas exploration of space over the last half century 
we will strengthen support for nasa and work in partnership with the international scientific community to launch new missions to space 
the democratic party will make it easier to start and grow a small business in america 
unlike donald trump who has often stiffed small businessesnearly bankrupting somewith his deceptive and reckless corporate practices 
by supporting small business and entrepreneurship we can grow jobs faster in america 
we will cut the red tape that holds back small businesses and entrepreneurs 
we will open up access to credit because we know that small businesses are some of the best job creators in our country 
we will provide tax relief and tax simplification 
and we will expand access to new markets because every american small business should be able to tap new markets whether across their city across their state or around the world 
democrats will provide targeted funding and support for entrepreneurship and small business growth in underserved communities 
democrats also realize the critical importance of small businesses as engines of opportunity for women people of color tribes and people in rural america and will work to nurture entrepreneurship 
democrats will make investments to spur the creation of millions of jobs for our young people 
roughly one in ten americans between the ages of and is unemployed more than twice the national average 
the unemployment rates for african american latino asian american and pacific islander aapi and american indian teenager sand youth with disabilities are far too high 
that is why democrats will provide direct federal funding for a range of local programs that will put young people to work and create new career opportunities 
democrats believe that todays extreme levels of income and wealth inequality are bad for our people bad for our businesses and bad for our economy 
our country depends on a thriving middle class to drive economic growth but the middle class is shrinking 
meanwhile the top onetenth of one percent of americans now own almost as much wealth as the bottom percent combined 
these trends create problems beyond insulting our sense of basic fairness 
social mobility is far lower than most believe it to be 
children who are born to families in the lowest fifth of earnings are more than times more likely to remain there as adults than they are to earn as much as those in the top fifth 
unless we invest in building a level playing field we all lose 
to restore economic fairness democrats will fight against the greed and recklessness of wall street 
wall street can not be an island unto itself gambling trillions in risky financial instruments and making huge profits all the while thinking that taxpayers will be there to bail them out again 
we must tackle dangerous risks in big banks and elsewhere in the financial system 
we must make wall street work for the jobcreating productive economyincluding by making loans more affordable for small and mediumsized businesses 
we need to prohibit wall street from picking and choosing which credit agency will rate its products as well as from imposing excessive fees on consumers 
and we must hold both individuals and corporations accountable when they break the law 
democrats believe that no bank can be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail 
democrats will support stronger criminal laws and civil penalties for wall street criminals who prey on the public trust 
we also support extending the statute of limitations for prosecuting major financial fraud and providing the department of justice the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission more resources to prosecute wrongdoing 
equal justice under law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the supreme court 
it will be the standard that applies to wall street and all americans 
we will also vigorously implement enforce and build on president obamas landmark doddfrank financial reform law and we will stop dead in its tracks every republican effort to weaken it 
we will stop republican efforts to hamstring our regulators through budget cuts 
and we will ensure they have the resources and independence to fully enforce the law and hold both individuals and corporations accountable when they break the rules 
we will also continue to protect consumers and defend the cfpb from republican attacks 
we oppose any efforts to change the cfpbs structure from a single director to a partisan gridlocked commission and likewise oppose any efforts to remove the bureaus independent funding and subject it to the appropriations process 
democrats will also continue to support the cfpb in enforcing foundational civil rights laws protecting against discrimination in consumer lending 
democrats condemn predatory payday lending and will protect consumers by defending the cfpb and implementing strong new regulations 
our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all americans not just a handful of billionaires 
we support a financial transactions tax on wall street to curb excessive speculation and highfrequency trading which has threatened financial markets 
we acknowledge that there is room within our party for a diversity of views on a broader financial transactions tax 
democrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability including new authorities to go after risky shadowbanking activities 
banks should not be able to gamble with taxpayers deposits or pose an undue risk to main street 
democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening including an updated and modernized version of glasssteagall as well as breaking up toobigtofail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy 
we believe that personnel is policy 
we will nominate and appoint regulators and officials who are not beholden to the industries they regulatepeople with a track record of standing up to power and safeguarding the public trust 
we will crack down on the revolving door between the private sectorparticularly wall streetand the federal government 
we will ban golden parachutes for those taking government jobs 
we will limit conflicts of interest by requiring bank and corporate regulators to recuse themselves from official work on particular matters that would directly benefit their former employers 
and we will bar financial service regulators from lobbying their former colleagues for at least two years 
we will protect and defend the federal reserves independence to carry out the dual mandate assigned to it by congressfor both full employment and low inflationagainst threats from new legislation 
we will also reform the federal reserve to make it more representative of america as a whole 
and we will fight to enhance its independence by ensuring that executives of financial institutions are not allowed to serve on the boards of regional federal reserve banks or to select members of those boards 
at a time when many of the largest banks have shunned communities across america democrats believe that we need to give americans affordable banking options including by empowering the united states postal service to facilitate the delivery of basic banking services 
large corporations have concentrated their control over markets to a greater degree than americans have seen in decades 
further evidence that the deck is stacked for those at the top 
democrats will take steps to stop corporate concentration in any industry where it is unfairly limiting competition 
we will make competition policy and antitrust stronger and more responsive to our economy today 
enhance the antitrust enforcement arms of the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc 
and encourage other agencies to police anticompetitive practices in their areas of jurisdiction 
we support the historic purpose of the antitrust laws to protect competition and prevent excessively consolidated economic and political power 
which can be corrosive to a healthy democracy 
we support reinvigorating doj and ftc enforcement of antitrust laws to prevent abusive behavior by dominant companies 
and protecting the public interest against abusive discriminatory and unfair methods of commerce 
we support president obamas recent executive order directing all agencies to identify specific actions they can take in their areas of jurisdiction to detect anticompetitive practicessuch as tying arrangements price fixing and exclusionary conduct 
and to refer practices that appear to violate federal antitrust law to the doj and ftc 
at a time of massive income and wealth inequality 
we believe the wealthiest americans and largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes 
democrats will claw back tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas 
eliminate tax breaks for big oil and gas companies 
and crack down on inversions and other methods companies use to dodge their tax responsibilities 
we will make sure that our tax code rewards businesses that make investments and provide goodpaying jobs here in the united states not businesses that walk out on america 
we will end deferrals so that american corporations pay united states taxes immediately on foreign profits and can no longer escape paying their fair share of us taxes by stashing profits abroad 
we will then use the revenue raised from fixing the corporate tax code to reinvest in rebuilding america 
and ensuring economic growth 
that will lead to millions of goodpaying jobs 
we will ensure those at the top contribute to our countrys future by establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share 
in addition we will shut down the private tax system for those at the top 
immediately close egregious loopholes like those enjoyed by hedge fund managers restore fair taxation on multimillion dollar estates 
and ensure millionaires can no longer pay a lower rate than their secretaries 
at a time of nearrecord corporate profits slow wage growth and rising costs 
we need to offer tax relief to middleclass families 
not those at the top 
democrats believe that no one should be able avoid paying their fair share by hiding money abroad 
and that corrupt leaders and terrorists should not be able to use the system of international finance to their advantage 
we will work to crack down on tax evasion 
and promote transparency to fight corruption and terrorism 
and we will make sure that lawabiding americans living abroad are not unfairly penalized by finding the right solutions for them to the requirements under the foreign account tax compliance act fatca and report of foreign bank and financial accounts fbar 
we will offer tax relief to hard working middleclass families for the cost squeeze they have faced for years from rising health care childcare education and other expenses 
donald trump and the republican party would do the opposite and provide trillions in tax cuts for millionaires billionaires and corporations 
at the expense of working families seniors and the health of our economy 
democrats acknowledge that for millions of americans global trade has failed to live up to its promise 
with too many countries breaking the rules 
and too many corporations outsourcing jobs at the expense of american workers and communities 
over the past three decades america has signed too many trade deals that have not lived up to the hype 
trade deals often boosted the profits of large corporations 
while at the same time failing to protect workers rights labor standards 
the environment 
and public health 
we need to end the race to the bottom and develop trade policies that support jobs in america 
that is why democrats believe we should review agreements negotiated years ago to update them to reflect these principles 
any future trade agreements must make sure our trading partners can not undercut american workers by taking shortcuts on labor policy 
or the environment 
they must not undermine democratic decisionmaking through special privileges and private courts for corporations 
and trade negotiations must be transparent and inclusive 
democrats priority is to significantly strengthen enforcement of existing trade rules and the tools we have including by holding countries accountable on currency manipulation and significantly expanding enforcement resources 
china and other countries are using unfair trade practices to tilt the playing field against american workers and businesses 
when they dump cheap products into our markets subsidize stateowned enterprises devalue currencies and discriminate against american companies our middle class pays the price 
that has to stop 
democrats will use all our trade enforcement tools to hold china and other trading partners accountablebecause no country should be able to manipulate their currencies to gain a competitive advantage 
while we believe that openness to the world economy is an important source of american leadership and dynamism 
we will oppose trade agreements that do not support good american jobs raise wages 
and improve our national security 
we believe any new trade agreements must include strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards in their core text with streamlined and effective enforcement mechanisms 
trade agreements should crack down on the unfair and illegal subsidies other countries grant their businesses at the expense of ours 
it should promote innovation of and access to lifesaving medicines 
and it should protect a free and open internet 
we should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government or other governments from putting in place rules that protect the environment food safety or the health of american citizens or others around the world 
these are the standards democrats believe must be applied to all trade agreements including the transpacific partnership tpp 
democrats believe that everyone deserves the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential 
we know that there are barriers standing in the way of that goal 
from the enduring scourge of systemic racism 
to our deeply broken immigration system 
to discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity 
and we are committed to facing those problems and fixing them 
being stronger together means reaching communities that have been left out and left behind for too long from coal country to indian country to neighborhoods held back by multigenerational poverty 
in america we do not tear each other downwe lift each other up 
democrats will fight to end institutional and systemic racism in our society 
we will challenge and dismantle the structures that define lasting racial economic political and social inequity 
democrats will promote racial justice through fair just and equitable governing of all publicserving institutions and in the formation of public policy 
democrats support removing the confederate battle flag from public properties recognizing that it is a symbol of our nations racist past that has no place in our present or our future 
we will push for a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and that there is no place for racism in our country 
americas economic inequality problem is even more pronounced when it comes to racial and ethnic disparities in wealth and income 
it is unacceptable that the median wealth for african americans and latino americans is roughly onetenth that of white americans 
these disparities are also stark for american indians and certain asian american subgroups and may become even more significant when considering other characteristics such as age disability status sexual 
the racial wealth and income gaps are the result of policies that discriminate against people of color 
and constrain their ability to earn income and build assets to the same extent as other americans 
it has accumulated over time and is made worse by ongoing policies and practices 
for example african americans and latinos lost more than half of their net worth as a result of the housing crisis and the great recession because they lost jobs at a much faster rate than white workers and because they were disproportionately targeted for subprime predatory and fraudulent mortgages during the runup to the housing crisis 
democrats believe it is long past time to close this racial wealth gap 
disparities in wealth can not be solved by the free market alone 
but instead the federal government must play a role in eliminating systemic barriers to wealth accumulation for different racial groups 
and improving opportunities for people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds to build wealth 
federal policies must remove barriers to achieving sustainable homeownership 
provide for greater diversity in federal and state contracting practices 
incentivize and expand access to retirement investment programs 
increase opportunities for quality jobs and education 
and challenge the deeply rooted structures that perpetuate and exacerbate current disparities and ultimately stagnate the nations economic growth and security 
democrats are committed to reforming our criminal justice system and ending mass incarceration 
something is profoundly wrong when almost a quarter of the worlds prison population is in the united states even though our country has less than five percent of the worlds population 
we will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and detention centers 
research and evidence rather than slogans and sound bites must guide criminal justice policies 
we will rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve 
across the country there are police officers inspiring trust and confidence honorably doing their duty deploying creative and effective strategies and demonstrating that it is possible to prevent crime without relying on unnecessary force 
they deserve our respect and support and we should learn from those examples and build on what works 
we will work with police chiefs to invest in training for officers on issues such as deescalation and the creation of national guidelines for the appropriate use of force 
we will encourage better policecommunity relations require the use of body cameras and stop the use of weapons of war that have no place in our communities 
we will end racial profiling that targets individuals solely on the basis of race religion ethnicity or national origin which is unamerican and counterproductive 
we should report national data on policing strategies and provide greater transparency and accountability 
we will require the department of justice to investigate all questionable or suspicious policeinvolved shootings 
and we will support states and localities who help make those investigations and prosecutions more transparent including through reforming the grand jury process 
we will assist states in providing a system of public defense that is adequately resourced and which meets american bar association standards 
and we will reform the civil asset forfeiture system to protect people and remove perverse incentives for law enforcement to police for a profit 
instead of investing in more jails and incarceration we need to invest more in jobs and education and end the schooltoprison pipeline 
we will remove barriers to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter society by banning the box expanding reentry programs and restoring voting rights 
we think the next president should take executive action to ban the box for federal employers and contractors so applicants have an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications before being asked about their criminal records 
the war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of millions of americans disproportionately people of color without reducing drug use 
whenever possible democrats will prioritize prevention and treatment over incarceration when tackling addiction and substance use disorder 
we will build on effective models of drug courts veterans courts and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration 
because of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of schedule federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization 
we believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so 
we support policies that will allow more research on marijuana as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty 
and we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for african americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites despite similar usage rates 
we will abolish the death penalty which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment 
it has no place in the united states of america 
the application of the death penalty is arbitrary and unjust 
the cost to taxpayers far exceeds those of life imprisonment 
it does not deter crime 
and exonerations show a dangerous lack of reliability for what is an irreversible punishment 
we have been inspired by the movements for criminal justice that directly address the discriminatory treatment of african americans latinos asian americans and pacific islanders and american indians to rebuild trust in the criminal justice system 
the united states was founded as and continues to be a country of immigrants from throughout the world 
it is no coincidence that the statue of liberty is one of our most profound national symbols 
and that is why democrats believe immigration is not just a problem to be solved it is a defining aspect of the american character and our shared history 
the democratic party supports legal immigration within reasonable limits that meets the needs of families communities and the economy 
as well as maintains the united states role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety freedom and security 
people should come to the united states with visas and not through smugglers 
yet we recognize that the current immigration system is broken 
more than million people are living in the shadows without proper documentation 
the immigration bureaucracy is full of backlogs that result in us citizens waiting for decades to be reunited with family members and green card holders waiting for years to be reunited with their spouses and minor children 
the current quota system discriminates against certain immigrants including immigrants of color and needs to be reformed to the realities of the st century 
and there are real questions about our detention and deportation policies that must be addressed 
democrats believe we need to urgently fix our broken immigration systemwhich tears families apart and keeps workers in the shadows 
and create a path to citizenship for lawabiding families who are here making a better life for their families and contributing to their communities and our country 
we should repeal the year year and permanent bars which often force persons in mixed status families into the heartbreaking dilemma of either pursuing a green card by leaving the country and their loved ones behind or remaining in the shadows 
we will work with congress to end the forced and prolonged expulsion from the country that these immigrants endure when trying to adjust their status 
we must fix family backlogs and defend against those who would exclude or eliminate legal immigration avenues and denigrate immigrants 
those immigrants already living in the united states who are assets to their communities and contribute so much to our country should be incorporated completely into our society through legal processes that give meaning to our national motto e pluribus unum 
and while we continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform we will defend and implement president obamas deferred action for childhood arrivals and deferred action for parents of americans executive actions to help dreamers parents of citizens and lawful permanent residents avoid deportation 
we will build on these actions to provide relief for others such as parents of dreamers 
we will support efforts by states to make dreamers eligible for drivers licenses and instate college tuition 
we will invest in culturallyappropriate immigrant integration services expand access to english language education and promote naturalization to help the millions of people who are eligible for citizenship take that last step 
we believe immigration enforcement must be humane and consistent with our values 
we should prioritize those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities not hardworking families who are contributing to their communities 
we will end raids and roundups of children and families which unnecessarily sow fear in immigrant communities 
we disfavor deportations of immigrants who served in our armed forces and we want to create a faster path for such veterans to citizenship 
we should ensure due process for those fleeing violence in central america and work with our regional partners to address the root causes of violence 
we must take particular care with children which is why we should guarantee governmentfunded counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration courts 
we should consider all available means of protecting these individuals from the threats to their lives and safetyincluding strengthening incountry and thirdcountry processing expanding the use of humanitarian parole and granting temporary protected status 
we will promote best practices among local law enforcement in terms of how they collaborate with federal authorities to ensure that they maintain and build trust between local law enforcement and the communities they serve 
we will also vigorously oversee any programs put in place to make sure that there are no abuses and no arbitrary deportation programs 
we will establish an affirmative process for workers to report labor violations and to request deferred action 
we will work to ensure that all americansregardless of immigration statushave access to quality health care 
that means expanding community health centers allowing all families to buy into the affordable care act exchanges supporting states that open up their public health insurance programs to all persons and finally enacting comprehensive immigration reform 
and we will expand opportunities for dreamers to serve in the military and to then receive expedited pathways to citizenship 
we will fight to end federal state and municipal contracts with forprofit private prisons and private detention centers 
in order to end family detention we will ensure humane alternatives for those who pose no public threat 
we recognize that there are vulnerable communities within our immigration system who are often seeking refuge from persecution abroad such as lgbt families for whom detention can be unacceptably dangerous 
we reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the united states 
it is unamerican and runs counter to the founding principles of this country 
finally democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language of donald trump 
his offensive comments about immigrants and other communities have no place in our society 
this kind of rhetoric must be rejected 
democrats will always fight to end discrimination on the basis of race ethnicity national origin language religion gender age sexual orientation gender identity or disability 
we need to promote civility and speak out against bigotry and other forms of intolerance that have entered our political discourse 
it is unacceptable to target defame or exclude anyone because of their race ethnicity national origin language religion gender age sexual orientation gender identity or disability 
while freedom of expression is a fundamental constitutional principle we must condemn hate speech that creates a fertile climate for violence 
we condemn donald trumps demonization of prisoners of war women muslims mexicans and people with disabilities 
his playing coy with white supremacists 
and the climate of bigotry he is creating 
we also condemn the recent uptick in other forms of hate speech like antisemitism and islamophobia 
we are committed to ensuring full equality for women 
democrats will fight to end gender discrimination in the areas of education employment health care or any other sphere 
we will combat biases across economic political and social life that hold women back and limit their opportunities and also tackle specific challenges facing women of color 
after years we will finally enshrine the rights of women in the constitution by passing the equal rights amendment 
and we will urge us ratification of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women 
democrats applaud last years decision by the supreme court that recognized that lgbt peoplelike other americanshave the right to marry the person they love 
but there is still much work to be done 
lgbt kids continue to be bullied at school restaurants can refuse to serve transgender people and samesex couples are at risk of being evicted from their homes that is unacceptable and must change 
democrats will fight for the continued development of sex discrimination law to cover lgbt people 
we will also fight for comprehensive federal nondiscrimination protections for all lgbt americans to guarantee equal rights in areas such as housing employment public accommodations credit jury service education and federal funding 
we will oppose all state efforts to discriminate against lgbt individuals including legislation that restricts the right to access public spaces 
we support a progressive vision of religious freedom that respects pluralism and rejects the misuse of religion to discriminate 
we will combat lgbt youth homelessness and improve school climates 
we will support lgbt elders ensure access to necessary health care and protect lgbt people from violenceincluding ending the crisis of violence against transgender americans 
we will also promote lgbt human rights 
and ensure americas foreign policy is inclusive of lgbt people around the world 
no one should face discrimination based on disability status 
democrats are committed to realizing the full promise of the americans with disabilities act 
we will protect and expand the right of americans with disabilities to get the accommodations and support they need to live in integrated community settings 
we will improve access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities 
we will provide tax relief to help the millions of families caring for aging relatives or family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities 
and we will continue to fight for ratification of the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities 
democrats know that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith in many forms and the countless acts of justice mercy and tolerance it inspires 
we believe in lifting up and valuing the good work of people of faith and religious organizations and finding ways to support that work where possible 
we believe in the power of national service to solve problems and break down barriers by bringing people of all backgrounds together in common purpose 
national service expands opportunity for people across america strengthening our communities and our country 
and those who serve earn education awards that they can use for college while building valuable work skills 
we will support and strengthen americorps with the goal that every american who wants to participate in fulltime national service will have the opportunity to do so 
we will work to build a stronger rural and agricultural economy 
democrats will increase funding to support the next generation of farmers and ranchers 
with particular attention given to promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural practices 
we will encourage programs to protect and enhance family farms a cherished way of life for millions of americans 
we will expand local food markets and regional food systems and provide a focused safety net to assist family operations that need support during challenging times 
and we will promote clean energy leadership and collaborative stewardship of our natural resources 
while expanding opportunities in rural communities across america 
while the epas new agricultural worker protection standard goes a long way to protect farmworkers from harmful pesticides and herbicides we recognize there is a lot more we can do 
the democratic party supports stronger agricultural worker protections including regulation of work hours elimination of child labor ensuring adequate housing for migrant workers and sanitary facilities in the field 
democrats will spur investment to power the rural economy

we reaffirm our commitment to eliminate poverty 
democrats will develop a national strategy coordinated across all levels of government to combat poverty 
we will direct more federal resources to lifting up communities that have been left out and left behind such as the model which directs percent of program funds to communities where at least percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for years or more 
we will also focus on communities that suffer from persistent poverty including empowerment zones and areas that targeted government data indicate are in persistent poverty 
in the richest country in the world no one especially our children 
should go hungry 
this is why democrats will protect proven programs like the supplemental nutrition assistance program snapour nations most important antihunger programthat help struggling families put food on the table 
we will also help people grow their skills through jobs and skills training opportunities 
the earned income tax credit eitc program should be expanded for lowwage workers not raising children including extending the credit to young workers starting at age 
the child tax credit ctc should be expanded for example by making more of it refundable or indexed to inflation to stem the erosion of the credit 
democrats will also do more to invest in our most distressed communitiesfrom our cities to coal country to the rust belt 
we will create goodpaying jobs and enhance opportunities by investing in small business youth employment and reentry programs for formerly incarcerated people 
we will expand and make permanent the new markets tax credit 
we will improve safety by repairing crumbling infrastructure in communities that need it most 
as well as on tribal lands 
and we will make investments in affordable housing near good jobs and good schools 
democrats have a comprehensive agenda to invest in americas cities grounded on the premise that local leaders are best equipped to create a better future for their residents but need the resources and flexibility to get the job done 
we also recognize there is no easy way to build strong neighborhoods and strong cities but rather we must address the challenge across many interconnected frontsfrom housing to schools to jobs to transportation to health 
we will dramatically increase federal infrastructure funding for our citiesmaking significant new investments in roads and bridges public transit drinking and wastewater systems broadband schools and more 
democrats also will revitalize communities being dragged down by physical decay by building on programs like the neighborhood stabilization program and the hardest hit fund which have helped cities across the country begin to address these challenges

investment in the arts strengthens our communities 
and contributes to our nations rich cultural heritage 
we will continue to support public funding for the national endowment for the arts for the national endowment for the humanities and for programs providing art and music education in primary and secondary schools 
the entire nation prospers when we protect and promote the unique artistic and cultural contributions of the women and men who create and preserve our nations heritage 
we have a profound moral and legal responsibility to the indian tribesthroughout our history we have failed to live up to that trust 
that is why the democratic party will fulfill honor and strengthen to the highest extent possible the united states fundamental trust responsibility 
grounded in the constitution treaties and case law to american indian and alaska native tribes 
we recognize the inherent sovereignty of indian nations and will work to enact laws and policies that strengthen not reduce the powers of indian nations over people who interact with them in indian country

we will work to fully fund the indian health service tribal and urban indian health care system and 
to ensure that all american indians have adequate safe and affordable access to primary care providers including oral health mental health practitioners and substance abuse treatment options 
we acknowledge the past injustices and the misguided harmful federal and state policies and actions based on outdated and discredited values and beliefs that resulted in the destruction of the indian nations economies 
social and religious systems 
the taking of their lands 
and the creation of intergenerational trauma that exists to this day 
we believe that we have a moral and profound duty to honor respect and uphold our sacred obligation to the indian nations and indian peoples 
we will manage for tribal sacred places 
and empower tribes to maintain and pass on traditional religious beliefs languages and social practices 
without fear of discrimination or suppression 
we also believe that native children are the future of tribal nations and that the indian child welfare act is critical to the survival of indian culture government and communities and must be enforced with the statutory intent of the law

democrats will increase engagement with american indiansalaska natives living outside of tribal communities 
democrats also support efforts for selfgovernance and selfdetermination of native hawaiians 
native hawaiians are the indigenous aboriginal people of hawaii whose values and culture are the foundation of the hawaiian islands 
we support proactive actions by the federal government to enhance native hawaiian culture health language and education 
we recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service to our country by native hawaiians 
and we are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in puerto rico 
many stem from the fundamental question of puerto ricos political status 
democrats believe that the people of puerto rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the constitution laws and policies of the united states 
democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity 
and goodpaying jobs for the hardworking people of puerto rico 
we also believe that puerto ricans must be treated equally by medicare medicaid and other programs that benefit families 
puerto ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws 
just as they should be treated equally 
all american citizens no matter where they reside should have the right to vote for the president of the united states 
finally we believe that federal officials must respect puerto ricos local selfgovernment as laws are implemented and puerto ricos budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity 
we also recognize and honor the contributions and the sacrifices made in service of our country by the americans living in the territories of guam american samoa the u s virgin islands and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands

for all those who live under our flag we support strong economic development 
and will work towards fair and equitable treatment under federal programs 
democrats know that americans right to vote is sacred and fundamental 
we believe that we must protect americans right to vote 
while stopping corporations outsized influence in elections 
we must rectify the supreme court decision gutting the voting rights act which is a profound injustice 
we will stop efforts by republican governors and legislatures to disenfranchise people of color lowincome people and young people 
and prevent these voters from exercising their right to vote through onerous restrictions 
we will ensure that election officials comply with voting protections including provisions mandating bilingual materials and voter assistance 
and we will fight to reform our broken campaign finance system 
which gives outsized influence to billionaires and big corporations 
its time we give back control of our elections to those to whom it belongsthe american people 
the democratic party was founded on the promise of an expanded democracy 
the right to vote is at the heart of our national vision 
it is a core principle of the democratic party to maximize voter participation for all americans 
our democracy suffers when nearly two thirds of our citizens do not or can not participate as in the last midterm elections 
democrats believe we must make it easier to vote not harder 
we must restore the full protections of the voting rights act 
we will bring our democracy into the st century by expanding early voting and votebymail 
implementing universal automatic voter registration and same day voter registration 
ending partisan and racial gerrymandering and making election day a national holiday 
we will restore voting rights for those who have served their sentences 
and we will continue to fight against discriminatory voter identification laws 
which disproportionately burden young voters diverse communities people of color lowincome families people with disabilities the elderly and women

we will support local county and state governments in their efforts to upgrade old voting equipment and machines with modern systems including voterverified paper ballots 
to ensure that all voters are able to exercise this sacred right in the quickest most convenient secure and accurate manner possible 
republicans have enacted various voter suppression tactics from ohio to florida 
and even though some federal courts have already found that these measures go too far 
democrats will continue to fight these laws to preserve the fundamental right to vote 
we support efforts to defeat illmotivated voter suppression tactics 
we also support ohios proposed voters bill of rights amendment north carolinas moral monday movement and similar initiatives to permanently safeguard this inalienable right 
democrats believe we must fight to preserve the essence of the longest standing democracy in the world 
a government that represents the american people not just a handful of powerful and wealthy special interests 
we will fight for real campaign finance reform now 
big money is drowning out the voices of everyday americans 
and we must have the necessary tools to fight back and safeguard our electoral and political integrity 
democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme courts decisions in citizens united and buckley v valeo 
we need to end secret unaccountable money in politics by requiring through executive order or legislation significantly more disclosure and transparencyby outside groups federal contractors and public corporations to their shareholders 
we need to amplify the voices of the american people through a small donor matching public financing system 
we need to overhaul and strengthen the federal election commission so that there is real enforcement of campaign finance laws 
and we need to fight to eliminate super pacs and outside spending abuses 
our vision for american democracy is a nation in which all people regardless of their income 
can participate in the political process and can run for office 
without needing to depend on large contributions from the wealthy and the powerful 
we will appoint judges who defend the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all 
and will protect a womans right to safe and legal abortion 
curb billionaires influence over elections because they understand that citizens united has fundamentally damaged our democracy 
and believe the constitution protects not only the powerful but also the disadvantaged and powerless 
restoring our democracy also means finally passing statehood for the district of columbia 
so that the american citizens who reside in the nations capital have full and equal congressional rights 
as well as the right to have the laws and budget of their local government respected without congressional interference 
democrats understand responsible fiscal stewardship is key to american democracy 
and to the countrys longterm economic prosperity 
we believe that by making those at the top and the largest corporations pay their fair share 
we can pay for ambitious progressive investments that create goodpaying jobs 
and offer security to working families 
without adding to the debt 
this stands in contrast to donald trump whose plans could add more than trillion to the debt and who casually suggests defaulting on americas debt 
ending more than years in which the full faith and credit of the united states has been sacrosanct 
we will also ensure that new spending and tax cuts are offset so that they do not add to the nations debt over time 
we will tackle waste fraud and abuse 
to make sure government dollars are spent wisely and efficiently 
democrats believe that we should not be contracting outsourcing or privatizing work that is inherently governmental in nature including postal services school services and state and local government services 
we are committed to a strong effective accountable civil service 
delivering the quality public services americans have every right to expect 
democrats believe that in general the most effective way to identify problems facing our country and develop good solutions is by enacting evidencebased public policy 
we recognize the value of data in allowing us to count and carefully consider the needs of different communities 
that is why we will preserve and enhance the integrity and accuracy of the census and the american community survey acs 
we will equip the census bureau with the resources needed to prepare for and conduct a cost effective complete and accurate census 
as well as improve counting segments of the population that are historically and persistently undercounted specifically communities of color immigrants lgbt people young children those with disabilities and rural and lowincome populations 
we will also maintain the legal requirement for the public to participate and be counted 
democrats also believe that government services should be culturally and linguistically appropriate and that data should be disaggregated for those communities like asian americans and pacific islanders where it is necessary to fully understand and address their needs 
finally democrats will make government simpler and more userfriendly 
the federal government too often operates with websites designed from another era that are too complicated too hard to use and rarely designed for mobile phones or tablets 
we will build on the creation of the united states digital service usds and give it the resources it needs to transform and digitize the top federal government programs that directly serve citizens 
we will eliminate internal barriers to government modernization 
and we will use technology to improve outcomes and government accountability by embracing prioritized goal setting and performance tracking for the federal government 
climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time 
fifteen of the hottest years on record have occurred this century 
while donald trump has called climate change a hoax 
is on track to break global temperature records once more 
cities from miami to baltimore are already threatened by rising seas 
california and the west have suffered years of brutal drought 
alaska has been scorched by wildfire 
new york has been battered by superstorms and texas swamped by flash floods 
the best science tells us that without ambitious immediate action across our economy to cut carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases all of these impacts will be far worse in the future 
we can not leave our children a planet that has been profoundly damaged 
democrats share a deep commitment to tackling the climate challenge 
creating millions of goodpaying middle class jobs 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions more than percent below levels by 
and meeting the pledge president obama put forward in the landmark paris agreement which aims to keep global temperature increases to well below two degrees celsius and to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to degrees celsius 
we believe america must be running entirely on clean energy by midcentury 
we will take bold steps to slash carbon pollution and protect clean air at home 
lead the fight against climate change around the world 
ensure no americans are left out or left behind as we accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy 
and be responsible stewards of our natural resources and our public lands and waters 
democrats reject the notion that we have to choose between protecting our planet and creating goodpaying jobs 
we can and we will do both 
we are committed to getting percent of our electricity from clean energy sources within a decade with half a billion solar panels installed within four years and enough renewable energy to power every home in the country 
we will cut energy waste in american homes schools hospitals and offices through energy efficient improvements 
modernize our electric grid 
and make american manufacturing the cleanest and most efficient in the world 
these efforts will create millions of new jobs 
and save families and businesses money on their monthly energy bills 
we will transform american transportation by reducing oil consumption through cleaner fuels vehicle electrification increasing the fuel efficiency of cars boilers ships and trucks 
we will make new investments in public transportation and build bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure across our urban and suburban areas 
democrats believe the tax code must reflect our commitment to a clean energy future by eliminating special tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies 
as well as defending and extending tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy 
democrats believe that carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities 
and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals 
democrats believe that climate change is too important to wait for climate deniers and defeatists in congress to start listening to science and support using every tool available to reduce emissions now 
democrats are committed to defending implementing and extending smart pollution and efficiency standards including the clean power plan 
fuel economy standards for automobiles and heavyduty vehicles building codes and appliance standards 
we are also committed to expanding clean energy research and development 
democrats recognize the importance of climate leadership at the local level and know that achieving our national clean energy goals requires an active partnership with states cities and rural communities where so much of our countrys energy policy is made 
we will ensure that those taking the lead on clean energy and energy efficiency have the tools and resources they need to succeed 
the federal government should lead by example which is why we support taking steps to power the government with percent clean electricity 
democrats are committed to closing the halliburton loophole that stripped the environmental protection agency epa of its ability to regulate hydraulic fracturing 
and ensuring tough safeguards are in place including safe drinking water act provisions to protect local water supplies 
we believe hydraulic fracturing should not take place where states and local communities oppose it 
we will reduce methane emissions from all oil and gas production and transportation by at least to percent below levels by through commonsense standards for both new and existing sources and by repairing and replacing thousands of miles of leaky pipes 
this will both protect our climate and create thousands of goodpaying jobs 
we will work to expand access to costsaving renewable energy by lowincome households 
create goodpaying jobs in communities that have struggled with energy poverty 
and oppose efforts by utilities to limit consumer choice or slow clean energy deployment 
we will streamline federal permitting to accelerate the construction of new transmission lines to get lowcost renewable energy to market 
and incentivize wind solar and other renewable energy over the development of new natural gas power plants 
we support president obamas decision to reject the keystone xl pipeline 
as we continue working to reduce carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gas emissions we must ensure federal actions do not significantly exacerbate global warming 
we support a comprehensive approach that ensures all federal decisions going forward contribute to solving not significantly exacerbating climate change 
democrats believe that our commitment to meeting the climate challenge must also be reflected in the infrastructure investments we make 
we need to make our existing infrastructure safer and cleaner and build the new infrastructure necessary to power our clean energy future 
to create goodpaying middle class jobs that can not be outsourced 
democrats support high labor standards in clean energy infrastructure and the right to form or join a union 
whether in renewable power or advanced vehicle manufacturing 
during the clean energy transition we will ensure landowners communities of color and tribal nations are at the table 
democrats believe clean air and clean water are basic rights of all americans 
yet as we saw in flint michigan lowincome communities and communities of color are disproportionately home to environmental justice hot spots where air pollution water pollution and toxic hazards like lead increase health and economic hardship 
the impacts of climate change will also disproportionately affect lowincome and minority communities tribal nations and alaska native villages 
all of which suffer the worst losses during extreme weather and have the fewest resources to prepare 
simply put this is environmental racism 
democrats believe we must make it a national priority to eradicate lead poisoning which disproportionately impacts lowincome children and children of color and can lead to lifelong health and educational challenges 
we will prioritize hiring and training workers from affected communities to clean up toxic brownfields and expand clean energy energy efficiency and resilient infrastructure 
the fight against climate change must not leave any community out or behind 
including the coal communities who kept americas lights on for generations 
democrats will fight to make sure these workers and their families get the benefits they have earned and the respect they deserve 
and we will make new investments in energyproducing communities to help create jobs and build a brighter and more resilient economic future 
we will also oppose threats to the public health of these communities from harmful and dangerous extraction practices like mountaintop removal mining operations 
all corporations owe it to their shareholders to fully analyze and disclose the risks they face including climate risk 
those who fail to do so should be held accountable 
democrats also respectfully request the department of justice to investigate allegations of corporate fraud on the part of fossil fuel companies accused of misleading shareholders and the public on the scientific reality of climate change 
democrats believe in the conservation and collaborative stewardship of our shared natural heritage the public lands and waterways the oceans everglades great lakes the arctic and all that makes americas great outdoors priceless 
as a nation we need policies and investments that will keep americas public lands public 
strengthen protections for our natural and cultural resources 
increase access to parks and public lands for all americans 
protect native species and wildlife 
and harness the immense economic and social potential of our public lands and waters 
democrats will work to establish an american parks trust fund to help expand local state and national recreational opportunities rehabilitate existing parks and enhance americas great outdoorsfrom our forests and coasts to neighborhood parks 
so americas best idea is held in trust for future generations 
and all americans can access and enjoy natural spaces 
democrats are committed to doubling the size of the outdoor economy creating nearly hundreds of billions of dollars in new economic activity and millions of new jobs 
democrats will approach conservation of our public lands and waters in a way that reflects the diversity of our country by actively engaging all americans in the great outdoors and protecting natural landscapes and cultural sites that tell the story of americas complex history 
to help meet these goals we will work to build a diverse workforce in agencies that manage americas public lands waters and cultural sites 
we oppose drilling in the arctic and off the atlantic coast 
and believe we need to reform fossil fuel leasing on public lands 
we will phase down extraction of fossil fuels from our public lands starting with the most polluting sources 
while making our public lands and waters engines of the clean energy economy and creating jobs across the country 
democrats will work to expand the amount of renewable energy production on federal lands and waters from wind in wyoming to solar in nevada 
democrats oppose efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the endangered species act to protect threatened and endangered species 
because the bristol bay drainages of alaska produce the worlds largest salmon fisheries we support efforts by the epa under the clean water act to establish proactively sciencebased restrictions on discharges of dredged or fill material associated with a potential pebble mine and urge that such restrictions must apply to potential mines at other metallic sulfide deposits in those drainages 
agricultural lands account for nearly half of the total land area in america and our agricultural practices have a significant impact on our water land oceans and the climate 
therefore we believe that in order to be effective in keeping our air and water clean and combating climate change 
we must enlist farmers as partners in promoting conservation and stewardship 
democrats know that every child no matter who they are how much their families earn or where they live should have access to a highquality education from preschool through high school and beyond 
but the united states still lags behind other advanced economies in providing highquality universal preschool programs to help all of our kids get a strong start to their educations 
our schools are more segregated today than they were when brown v board of education was decided 
and we see wide disparities in educational outcomes across racial and socioeconomic lines 
a college degree or another form of postsecondary education is increasingly required for jobs that pay a middleclass wage 
but graduation rates have stagnated for lowincome students 
and the high cost of college has required too many americans to take out staggering student loans or put a degree out of reach entirely 
we are selling our children and our young people short 
democrats are committed to making good public schools available to every child no matter what zip code they live in and at last making debtfree college a reality for all americans 
democrats believe that in america if you want a higher education you should always be able to get one money should never stand in the way 
cost should not be a barrier to getting a degree or credential and debt should not hold you back after you graduate 
bold new investments by the federal government 
coupled with states reinvesting in higher education and colleges holding the line on costs 
will ensure that americans of all backgrounds will be prepared for the jobs and economy of the future 
democrats are unified in their strong belief that every student should be able to go to college debtfree 
and working families should not have to pay any tuition to go to public colleges and universities 
we will also make community college free 
while ensuring the strength of our historically black colleges and universities and minorityserving institutions 
the federal government will push more colleges and universities to take quantifiable affirmative steps in increasing the percentages of racial and ethnic minority lowincome and firstgeneration students they enroll and graduate 
achieving these goals depends on state and federal investment in both students and their teachers 
whether fulltime or adjunct faculty must be supported to make transformative educational experiences possible 
as we make college affordable for future students 
we will not forget about the millions of borrowers with unsustainable levels of student debt who need help right now 
democrats will allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible 
we will simplify and expand access to incomebased repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford 
and we will significantly cut interest rates for future undergraduates because we believe that making college more affordable is more important than the federal government making billions of dollars in profit off those loans 
democrats will also fight for a student borrower bill of rights to ensure borrowers get adequate information about options to avoid or get out of delinquency or default 
we will hold lenders and loan servicers to high standards to help borrowers in default rehabilitate and repay their debts 
we will continue the important public service loan forgiveness and loan discharge programs begun by the obama administration 
finally democrats will restore the prior standard in bankruptcy law to allow borrowers with student loans to be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy as a measure of last resort 
to make progress toward these goals the government should offer a moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers so they have the time and get the resources they need to consolidate their loans enroll in incomebased repayment programs and take advantage of opportunities to reduce monthly payments and fees 
we will strengthen our nations public and private historically black colleges and universities predominantly black institutions hispanicserving institutions asian american and native american pacific islanderserving institutions tribal colleges and universities alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions native americanserving nontribal institutions and minorityserving institutions 
many of these schools educate disproportionate percentages of growing populations of americans students who are racial and ethnic minorities lowincome students and firstgeneration students 
as the nation is grappling with how to expand educational access and increase success especially for communities of color and lowincome students and families there is evidence that the nations hbcus and minority serving institutions have honed promising models for educating these students to prepare them for high and criticalneed positions while containing costs 
we will create a robust and historic dedicated fund to keep costs down provide quality education and ensure dedicated support to improve student outcomes and completion rates 
we will provide further assistance to students at these schools as well as other students across the country 
by restoring yearround pell funding so that low and middleincome students from all backgrounds can get the support they need to make progress toward a college degree throughout the year 
we will continue to crack down on forprofit schools that take millions in federal financial aidoften as their principal source of revenueand then exploit students and burden them with debt rather than educating them 
that is why we will strengthen the gainful employment rule to ensure that forprofit schools enable students to complete their degrees and prepare them for work 
we will go after forprofits that engage in deceptive marketing fraud and other illegal practices 
we will also exercise our responsibility in oversight over the department of education to carry out their obligation to close down those forprofit schools that consistently engage in fraudulent and illegal conduct 
it is unacceptable that forprofit schools with low graduation rates keep encouraging their students to take out federal loans they will have trouble paying back 
therefore to the maximum extent possible we will also encourage widespread relief and the forgiveness of debt to those students harmed by the practices of fraudulent institutions 
democrats believe we must have the besteducated population and workforce in the world 
that means making early childhood education and universal preschool a priority especially in light of new research showing how much early learning can impact lifelong success 
democrats will invest in early childhood programs like early head start and provide every family in america with access to highquality childcare and highquality preschool programs 
we support efforts to raise wages for childcare workers 
and to ensure that early childhood educators are experienced and highquality 
we will ensure there are great schools for every child 
no matter where they live 
democrats know the federal government must play a critical role in making sure every child has access to a worldclass education 
we believe that a strong public education system is an anchor of our democracy 
a propeller of the economy 
and the vehicle through which we help all children achieve their dreams 
public education must engage students to be critical thinkers and civic participants 
while addressing the wellbeing of the whole child 
we also support increased investments in afterschool and summer learning programs 
which help working families 
keep kids safe 
and inspire learning at a time when many students are left unsupervised 
we must find ways to encourage mentoring programs that support students in reaching their full potential 
mentoring is a strategy to ensure that children living in poverty have the encouragement and support to aim high and enter the middle class 
we will focus on group mentoring which is a lowcost highyield investment that offers the benefit of building a supportive network of peers who push one another towards success 
democrats believe all students should be taught to high academic standards 
schools should have adequate resources to provide programs and support to help meet the needs of every child 
we will hold schools districts communities and states accountable for raising achievement levels for all students 
particularly lowincome students students of color english language learners and students with disabilities 
we must fulfill our national commitment to provide a meaningful education to students with disabilities and work towards full funding of the individuals with disabilities education act so that students with disabilities can receive the extra resources and services they need 
with an appropriate educational foundation children with disabilities can thrive and become adults with greater opportunities and more meaningful life experiences 
we are also deeply committed to ensuring that we strike a better balance on testing so that it informs but does not drive instruction 
to that end we encourage states to develop a multiple measures approach to assessment and we believe that standardized tests must be reliable and valid 
we oppose highstakes standardized tests that falsely and unfairly label students of color students with disabilities and english language learners as failing 
the use of standardized test scores as basis for refusing to fund schools or to close schools 
and the use of student test scores in teacher and principal evaluations a practice which has been repeatedly rejected by researchers 
we support enabling parents to opt their children out of standardized tests without penalty for either the student or their school 
democrats recognize and honor all the professionals who work in public schools to support students educationteachers education support professionals and specialized staff 
we know that good teachers are essential to improving student learning and helping all students to meet high academic standards 
democrats will launch a national campaign to recruit and retain highquality teachers 
we will ensure that teachers receive the tools and ongoing professional development they need to succeed in the classroom and provide our children with a worldclass education 
we also must lift up and trust our educators continually build their capacity and ensure that our schools are safe welcoming collaborative and wellresourced places for our students educators and communities 
we will invest in highquality steam classes community schools computer science education arts education and expand link learning models and career pathways 
we will end the schooltoprison pipeline by opposing discipline policies which disproportionately affect african americans and latinos native americans and alaska natives students with disabilities and youth who identify as lgbt 
we will support the use of restorative justice practices that help students and staff resolve conflicts peacefully and respectfully while helping to improve the teaching and learning environment 
and we will work to improve school culture and combat bullying of all kinds 
the democratic party is committed to eliminating opportunity gapsparticularly those that lead to students from lowincome communities arriving on day one of kindergarten several years behind their peers 
this means advocating for labor and public assistance laws that ensure poor parents can spend time with their children 
this means raising household incomes in poor communities 
it means ensuring children have health care stable housing free of contaminants and a community free of violence in order to minimize the likelihood of cognitive delays 
it means enriching early childhood programming to prepare children in areas such as literacy numeracy civic engagement and emotional intelligence 
it means supporting equitable and adequate state funding for public education 
and expanding title i funding for schools that serve a large number or high concentration of children in poverty 
it means ending curriculum gaps that maintain and exacerbate achievement gaps 
we support policies that motivate rather than demoralize our educators 
we are committed to ensuring that schools that educate children in poverty are not treated unfairly which is why we will end the testandpunish version of accountability that does no more than reveal the many opportunity gaps facing students from lowincome communities 
democrats are committed to providing parents with highquality public school options and expanding these options for lowincome youth 
we support democratically governed great neighborhood public schools 
and highquality public charter schools 
and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators 
democrats oppose forprofit charter schools focused on making a profit off of public resources 
we believe that highquality public charter schools should provide options for parents 
but should not replace or destabilize traditional public schools 
charter schools must reflect their communities and thus must accept and retain proportionate numbers of students of color students with disabilities and english language learners in relation to their neighborhood public schools 
we support increased transparency and accountability for all charter schools 
democrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the american people for generations and we are proud to be the party that passed medicare medicaid and the affordable care act aca 
being stronger together means finally achieving that goal 
we are going to fight to make sure every american has access to quality affordable health care 
we will tackle the problems that remain in our health care system including cracking down on runaway prescription drug prices and addressing mental health with the same seriousness that we treat physical health 
we will fight republican efforts to roll back the clock on womens health and reproductive rights and stand up for planned parenthood 
and we will tackle the epidemics of substance abuse and gun violence which each claim tens of thousands of lives every year 
democrats believe that health care is a right not a privilege and our health care system should put people before profits 
thanks to the hard work of president obama and democrats in congress we took a critically important step toward the goal of universal health care by passing the affordable care act which has covered million more americans and ensured millions more will never be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition 
democrats will never falter in our generationslong fight to guarantee health care as a fundamental right for every american 
as part of that guarantee americans should be able to access public coverage through a public option 
and those over should be able to opt in to medicare 
democrats will empower the states which are the true laboratories of democracy 
to use innovation waivers under the aca to develop unique locally tailored approaches to health coverage 
this will include removing barriers to states which seek to experiment with plans to ensure universal health care to every person in their state 
by contrast donald trump wants to repeal the aca leaving tens of millions of americans without coverage 
for too many of us health care costs are still too high even for those with insurance 
and medical debt is a problem for far too many working families with onequarter of americans reporting that they or someone in their household had problems or an inability to pay medical bills in the past year 
democrats will also work to end surprise billing and other practices that lead to outofcontrol medical debt that place an unconscionable economic strain on american households 
we will repeal the excise tax on highcost health insurance and find revenue to offset it because we need to contain the longterm growth of health care costs 
but should not risk passing on too much of the burden to workers 
democrats will keep costs down by making premiums more affordable reducing outofpocket expenses and capping prescription drug costs 
and we will fight against insurers trying to impose excessive premium increases 
democrats will fight any attempts by republicans in congress to privatize voucherize or phase out medicare as we know it 
and we will oppose republican plans to slash funding and block grant medicaid and snap which would harm millions of americans 
we will keep fighting until the acas medicaid expansion has been adopted in every state 
nineteen states have not yet expanded medicaid 
this means that millions of lowincome americans still lack health insurance and are not getting the care they need 
additionally health care providers clinics hospitals and taxpayers are footing a higher bill when people without insurance visit expensive emergency rooms 
democrats believe your zip code or census tract should not be a predictor of your health 
which is why we will make health equity a central part of our commitment to revitalizing communities left behind 
democrats believe that all health care services should be culturally and linguistically appropriate 
and that neither fear nor immigration status should be barriers that impede health care access 
we must renew and expand our commitment to community health centers as well as community mental health centers 
and family planning centers 
these health centers provide critically important communitybased prevention and treatment in underserved communities 
prevent unnecessary and expensive trips to emergency rooms 
and are essential to the successful implementation of the aca 
we will fight for a comprehensive system of primary health care including dental mental health care and lowcost prescription drugs by doubling of funding for federally qualified community health centers over the next decade which currently serve million people 
democrats also know that one of the key ingredients to the success of these health centers is a wellsupported and qualified workforce in communitybased settings 
we will fight to train and support this workforce encourage providers to work with underserved populations through the national health service corps 
and create a comprehensive strategy to increase the pool of primary health care professionals 
it is unacceptable that the united states pays by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and that too many americans between the ages of and can not afford to fill their prescriptions 
a lifesaving drug is no good if it is unaffordable to the very people who need it most 
and many drug companies are spending more on advertising than on research 
the largest pharmaceutical companies are making billions of dollars per year in profits at higher margins compared to other industries while many stash their profits in offshore tax havens 
meanwhile they charge americans thousands of dollars for new drugsoften at much higher costs than in other developed nations 
democrats are committed to investing in the research development and innovation that creates lifesaving drugs and lowers overall health costs 
but the profiteering of pharmaceutical companies is simply unacceptable 
we will crack down on price gouging by drug companies and cap the amount americans have to pay outofpocket every month on prescription drugs 
we will prohibit anticompetitive pay for delay deals that keep generic drugs off the market 
and we will allow individuals pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in canada and other countries with appropriate safety protections 
democrats will also fight to make sure that medicare will negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers 
democrats believe we must accelerate the pace of medical progress ensuring that we invest more in our scientists and give them the resources they need to invigorate our fundamental studies in the life sciences in a growing stable and predictable way 
we must make progress against the full range of diseases including alzheimers hiv and aids cancer and other diseases especially chronic ones 
we recognize the critical importance of a fullyfunded national institutes of health to accelerate the pace of medical progress 
we must confront the epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction specifically the opioid crisis and other drugs plaguing our communities by vastly expanding access to prevention and treatment 
supporting recovery 
helping community organizations 
and promoting better practices by prescribers 
the democratic party is committed to assisting the estimated million people struggling with addiction in this country to find and sustain healthy lives by encouraging full recovery and integration into society 
and working to remove common barriers to gainful employment housing and education 
we will continue to fight to expand access to care for addiction services 
and ensure that insurance coverage is equal to that for any other health conditions 
we think it is time for the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor and state regulatory agencies to fully implement the protections of the mental health parity and addictions equity act of which means that american medical insurers including the federal government will need to disclose how they make their medical management decisions 
we should also do more to educate our youth as well as their families teachers coaches mentors and friends to intervene early to prevent drug and alcohol abuse and addiction 
we should help state and local leaders establish evidencebased ageappropriate and locallytailored prevention programs 
these programs include schoolbased drug education programs that have been shown to have meaningful effects on risky behavior communitybased peer mentorship and leadership programs and afterschool activities that deter drug use and encourage life skills 
we must treat mental health issues with the same care and seriousness that we treat issues of physical health 
support a robust mental health workforce 
and promote better integration of the behavioral and general health care systems 
recognizing that maintaining good mental health is critical to all people including young peoples health and development 
we will work with health professionals to ensure that all children have access to mental health care 
we must also expand communitybased treatment for substance abuse disorders and mental health conditions and fully enforce our parity law 
and we should create a national initiative around suicide prevention across the lifespanto move toward the hhspromoted zero suicide commitment 
democrats believe that our country must make supporting the millions of individuals with autism and those diagnosed in the future and their families a priority 
we will conduct a nationwide early screening outreach campaign to ensure that all children and in particular children from underserved backgrounds 
can get screened for autism 
we will expand services and support for adults and individuals transitioning into adulthood including employment and housing assistance 
and we will push states to require health insurance coverage for autism services in private insurance plans as well as state marketplaces so that people with autism are not denied care 
democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health rights and justice 
we believe unequivocally like the majority of americans that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services including safe and legal abortion 
regardless of where she lives how much money she makes or how she is insured 
we believe that reproductive health is core to womens mens and young peoples health and wellbeing 
we will continue to stand up to republican efforts to defund planned parenthood health centers which provide critical health services to millions of people 
we will continue to opposeand seek to overturnfederal and state laws and policies that impede a womans access to abortion including by repealing the hyde amendment 
we condemn and will combat any acts of violence harassment and intimidation of reproductive health providers patients and staff 
we will defend the aca which extends affordable preventive health care to women including nocost contraception 
and prohibits discrimination in health care based on gender 
we will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services including those based on gender sexuality race income disability and other factors 
we recognize that quality affordable comprehensive health care evidencebased sex education and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions 
and we strongly and unequivocally support a womans decision to have a child including by ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth 
and by providing services during pregnancy and after the birth of a child including adoption and social support services as well as protections for women against pregnancy discrimination 
we are committed to creating a society where children are safe and can thrive physically emotionally educationally and spiritually 
we recognize and support the importance of civil structures that are essential to creating this for every child 
our country faces a longterm care crisis that prevents too many seniors and people with disabilities from being able to live with dignity at home or in their communities 
the vast majority of people who are aging or living with a disability want to do so at home but face challenges finding and affording the support they need to do so 
programs that emphasize independence rather than institutionalization must be better structured to support them 
democrats will take steps to strengthen and expand the home care workforce 
give seniors and people with disabilities access to quality affordable longterm care services and supports 
and ensure that all of these resources are readily available at home or in the community 
investment in our nations crumbling public health infrastructure is critical to ensuring preparedness for emerging threats 
for preventing disease illness and injury in communities 
and for promoting good health and wellbeing 
inadequate access to public health services has a disparate impact on poor rural and minority communities where public health services are a significant source of health care 
democrats will fight for increased investments in public health to better address emerging threats and the needs across our country 
to further that end the democratic party will continue to oppose republican attempts to cut public health services and funding 
we will ensure adequate funding of public health education at the undergraduate graduate and medical school levels as well as adequate funding of residency training programs in public health preventive medicine and its subspecialties 
we must take a number of proactive steps so that all americansregardless of location income or historyhave the opportunity to live full healthy lives 
democrats will fight for increased investments and coordination in public health to better address emerging threats as well as persistent needs across our country 
health equity among americans remains elusive 
higher income is strongly associated with longer life expectancy and the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest americans is increasing 
we continue to see unacceptable differences in health outcomes by race ethnicity and sexual orientation 
a growing body of research demonstrates the link between social factorssuch as poverty unemployment experience of discrimination and housing instabilityand poor health 
democrats will continue to pursue policies addressing these social factors and empowering communities to respond to their most pressing health needs 
democrats are committed to ending the scourge of violence against women wherever it occurs whether in our homes streets schools military or elsewhere 
we will continue to support the violence against women act to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to combat this problem 
we will support comprehensive services for survivors of violence and increase prevention efforts in our communities and on our campuses 
democrats will fight to bring an end to sexual assaultwherever it occurs including on campuses 
because everyone deserves a safe environment where they can learn and thrive not live in fear 
we will provide comprehensive support to survivors 
and ensure a fair process for all oncampus disciplinary proceedings and in the criminal justice system 
we will increase sexual violence prevention education programs that cover issues like consent and bystander intervention not only in college but also in secondary school 
with americans dying every year democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence 
while responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities 
too many families in america have suffered from gun violence 
we can respect the rights of responsible gun owners 
while keeping our communities safe 
to build on the success of the lifesaving brady handgun violence prevention act we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws 
repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy 
and keep weapons of warsuch as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines lcamsoff our streets 
we will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers 
and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists intimate partner abusers other violent criminals 
and those with severe mental health issues 
there is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies which is why the us centers for disease control and prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue 
democrats believe that america must lead in the world to grow our economy 
protect our interests and values 
and make our country safer 
and more prosperous 
we can not walk away from our position of global leadership and allow other countries to make decisions about our lives jobs and safety 
democrats further believe that when america leads it must be as a principled force for peace and prosperity in the world 
we believe all people deserve to live in dignity and have their rights respected 
we believe protecting rights and opportunities for women and girls is essential for security 
and economic growth 
we believe providing access to education and employment for young people and safeguarding the rights of minorities is important to ensuring stability 
we believe the smart use of diplomacy development and economic statecraft can prevent crises foster stability and make us safer 
and we believe that we are stronger when we work with our partners and allies rather than try to go it alone 
our global network of alliances is not a burdenit is a source of tremendous strategic advantage 
we believe that while our military must be the strongest in the world 
it should only be sent into combat when the terms of engagement are clearly presented to the american people and our troops have what they need to fulfill their mission 
we believe that war must always be the last resort never the first choice 
these principles have underpinned important progress in the last eight years 
when president obama and vice president biden assumed office the world economy was in the worst crisis since the great depression 
our alliances were strained 
osama bin laden remained at large 
iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon 
and we were mired in two costly wars 
we brought bin laden to justice crippled al qaedas core leadership 
saved america from a second great depression 
repaired our alliances reestablished relations with cuba while pressing for reforms 
andwithout firing a shot dropping a bomb or putting a single american soldier in harms way 
blocked irans ability to pursue a nuclear weapon 
america is stronger abroad and safer at home because of this principled leadership 
but there is much more to do to keep our country prosperous and safe 
from defeating terrorism 
and combating climate change 
to managing chinas rise 
and strengthening our nations cybersecurity 
the next democratic administration will confront the complex challenges that lie ahead by staying true to our principles and core values 
donald trump has a different approach 
there has never been a major party candidate less qualified or less fit for the office of president of the united states or to be commanderinchief than donald trump 
he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons 
he thinks our military should engage in war crimes 
he wants to build walls and keep peopleincluding americansfrom entering the country based on their race religion ethnicity and national origin 
he has no strategy for dealing with key threats facing our country including climate change 
and isis 
he wants to abandon our allies and empower our adversaries 
his dangerous incoherent policies would undo the progress we have made 
donald trump believes america is weak and an embarrassment 
we believe america is unlike any other nation on earth 
our ingenuity is unparalleled 
our military unrivaled 
our economy the largest most dynamic and innovative 
and our values an enduring source of strength and inspiration the world over 
we are not a country that cowers behind walls 
we lead with purpose 
with american leadership guided by our principles 
and in concert with our allies and partners 
the coming years can be the most stable secure and prosperous time we and the world have ever known 
democrats believe america must continue to have the strongest military in the world 
donald trump has called our military a disaster 
we reject that view of our brave men and women in serving in the army marine corps navy air force and coast guard 
they perform admirably while sacrificing immeasurably 
we support a smart predictable defense budget that meets the strategic challenges we face 
not the arbitrary cuts that the republican congress enacted as part of sequestration 
we must prioritize military readiness by making sure our active reserve and national guard components remain the best trained and equipped in the world 
we will seek a more agile and flexible force and rid the military of outdated cold warera systems 
we must end waste in the defense budget 
we will audit the pentagon launch a highlevel commission to review the role of defense contractors 
and take greater action against those who have been involved in fraud 
and we will ensure that the department of defense invests its budget wisely 
our country has a sacred moral responsibility to keep faith with all our veterans and wounded warriors 
we must take care of those who have put their lives on the line to defend us 
that is why we will push for more educational benefits and job training 
end chronic homelessness and combat suicide 
and protect and preserve the post gi bill for future generations 
we will also ensure that reservists and guard members are treated fairly when it comes to employment health education benefits deployment and reintegration 
we are outraged by the systemic problems plaguing the department of veterans affairs va 
we will fight for every veteran to have timely access to highquality health care and timely processing of claims and appeals 
we must also look for more ways to make certain the va provides veterancentric care 
such as providing women with full and equal treatment 
including reproductive health services 
expanding mental health programs 
continuing efforts to identify and treat invisible latent and toxic wounds of war 
treating posttraumatic stress 
and expanding the post veterans caregiver program to include all veterans 
we reject attempts by republicans to sell out the needs of veterans by privatizing the va 
we believe that the va must be fully resourced so that every veteran gets the care that he or she has earned and deserves including those suffering from sexual assault mental illness and other injuries or ailments 
democrats honor the sacrifice of military families who serve alongside our service members 
we recognize the unique concerns and challenges they face especially after years of continuous deployments 
we will support military families with jobs education childcare and health care 
we will promote familyfriendly policies 
and champion efforts to care for our military family members 
especially for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one or lifealtering injury or disability 
democrats welcome and honor all americans who want to serve and will continue to fight for their equal rights and recognition 
we are proud of the repeal of dont ask dont tell and we commit ourselves to insuring fair treatment for lgbt veterans including by proactively reviewing and upgrading discharge records for veterans who were discharged because of their sexual orientation 
we are also proud of the opening of combat positions to women 
our military is strongest when people of all races religions sexual orientations and gender identities are honored for their service to our country 
democrats are committed to addressing the scourge of military sexual assault 
we must increase efforts to prevent sexual assault and rape 
and aggressively investigate and prosecute allegations 
and we must make sure victims receive timely appropriate and comprehensive treatment for physical emotional and psychological trauma resulting from sexual assault 
democrats will protect our country 
we will strengthen our homeland security 
deal wisely and firmly with those who seek to imperil america or our partners 
deter aggression and promote peace 
we will use all the tools of american power especially diplomacy and development to confront global threats and ensure war is the last resort 
we must defeat isis al qaeda and their affiliates and prevent other groups from emerging in their place 
democrats will continue to lead a broad coalition of allies and partners to destroy isis stronghold in iraq and syria 
we will press those in the region especially the gulf countries and local forces on the ground to carry their weight in prosecuting this fight 
we will dismantle the global network of terror which supplies terrorists with money arms and fighters 
and stop them from recruiting and inspiring potential radicals 
we will improve our intelligence capabilities 
with appropriate safeguards here at home 
and ensure that the intelligence community and law enforcement is prepared to deal effectively with the threats we face 
we will harden our defenses as well as those of our partners against external and homegrown threats 
we will secure the homeland investing more resources to improve mass transit aviation infrastructure and port security 
and we will remain a resilient nation always coming together to stand up to terror 
democrats will seek an updated authorization for use of military force aumf that is more precise about our efforts to defeat isis and that does not involve largescale combat deployment of american troops 
as we prosecute the fight against terrorism democrats will repudiate vile tactics that would do us harm 
we reject donald trumps vilification of muslims 
it violates the religious freedom that is the bedrock of our country and feeds into isis nefarious narrative 
it also alienates people and countries who are crucial to defeating terrorism 
the vast majority of muslims believe in a future of peace and tolerance 
we reject donald trumps suggestion that our military should engage in war crimes like torturing prisoners or murdering civilian family members of suspected terrorists 
these tactics run counter to american principles undermine our moral standing 
cost innocent lives 
and endanger americans 
we also firmly reject donald trumps willingness to mire tens of thousands of our combat troops in another misguided ground war in the middle east which would only further embolden isis 
there is nothing smart or strong about such an approach 
the syrian crisis is heartbreaking and dangerous and its impact is threatening the region europe and beyond 
donald trump would inflame the conflict by alienating our allies 
inexplicably allowing isis to expand in syria 
and potentially starting a wider war 
this is a reckless approach 
democrats will instead root out isis and other terrorist groups 
and bring together the moderate syrian opposition international community and our regional allies to reach a negotiated political transition that ends assads rule 
given the immense scale of human suffering in syria it is also imperative that we lead the international community 
in providing greater humanitarian assistance to the civilian victims of war in syria and iraq especially displaced refugees 
in afghanistan we will work with the natoled coalition of partners to bolster the democraticallyelected government as it assumes a primary role in tackling terrorism 
forges a more secure future for the country 
and safeguards advances like securing womens rights 
democrats will continue to push for an afghanled peace process and press both afghanistan and pakistan to deny terrorists sanctuary on either side of the border 
we support president obamas decision to maintain a limited troop presence in afghanistan into 
and ensure that afghanistan never again serves as a haven for terrorists to plan and launch attacks on our homeland 
we support the nuclear agreement with iran because as it is vigorously enforced and implemented it verifiably cuts off all of irans pathways to a bomb without resorting to war 
we reject donald trumps view that we should have walked away from a deal that peacefully dismantles irans nuclear program 
we will continue the work of this administration to ensure that iran never acquires a nuclear weapon 
and will not hesitate to take military action if iran races towards one 
democrats will also address the detrimental role iran plays in the region and will robustly enforce and if necessary strengthen nonnuclear sanctions 
iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism 
it violates the human rights of its population denies the holocaust vows to eliminate israel and has its fingerprints on almost every conflict in the middle east 
democrats will push back against irans destabilizing activities including its support for terrorist groups like hamas and hezbollah 
counter irans ballistic missile program 
bolster the capabilities of our gulf partners 
and ensure that israel always has the ability to defend itself 
finally democrats recognize that the iranian people seek a brighter future for their country and greater engagement with the international community 
we will embrace opportunities for cultural academic and other exchanges with the iranian people 
north korea is perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet run by a sadistic dictator 
it has conducted several nuclear tests and is attempting to develop the capability to put a nuclear warhead on a longrange missile that could directly threaten the united states 
the regime is also responsible for grave human rights abuses against the north korean people 
yet donald trump praises north koreas dictator 
threatens to abandon our treaty allies japan and south korea 
and encourages the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region 
this approach is incoherent and rather than solving a global crisis would create a new one 
democrats will protect america and our allies 
press china to restrain north korea 
and sharpen the choices for pyongyang to compel it to abandon its illegal nuclear and missile programs 
russia is engaging in destabilizing actions along its borders violating ukraines sovereignty and attempting to recreate spheres of influence that undermine american interests 
it is also propping up the assad regime in syria which is brutally attacking its own citizens 
donald trump would overturn more than years of american foreign policy by abandoning nato partnerscountries who help us fight terrorism every dayand embracing russian president vladimir putin instead 
we believe in strong alliances and will deter russian aggression 
build european resilience 
and protect our nato allies 
we will make it clear to putin that we are prepared to cooperate with him when it is in our interestas we did on reducing nuclear stockpiles ensuring iran could not obtain a nuclear weapon sanctioning north korea and resupplying our troops in afghanistan 
but we will not hesitate to stand up to russian aggression 
we will also continue to stand by the russian people and push the government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens 
democrats will protect our industry infrastructure and government from cyberattacks 
we will strengthen our cybersecurity 
seek to establish global norms in cyberspace 
and impose consequences on those who violate the rules 
we will do this while protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the american people 
we will also ensure a coherent strategy across federal agencies by building on the obama administrations cybersecurity national action plan especially the empowerment of a federal chief information security officer the modernization of federal information technology and upgrades to governmentwide cybersecurity 
democrats reject the false choice between privacy interests and keeping americans safe 
we need liberty 
and security 
and each makes the other possible 
we will protect the privacy and civil liberties of the american peoplestanding firm against the type of warrantless surveillance of american citizens that flourished during the bush administration 
we support recent reforms to government bulk data collection programs so the government is not collecting and holding millions of files on innocent americans 
we will support a national commission on digital security and encryption to bring together technology and public safety communities to address the needs of law enforcement 
protect the privacy of americans 
assess how innovation might point to new policy approaches 
and advance our larger national security and global competitiveness interests 
democrats are committed to preventing the spread of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and to eventually ridding the planet of these catastrophic weapons 
we believe america will be safer in a world with fewer weapons of mass destruction 
donald trump encourages the spread of nuclear weapons across asia and the middle east which would weaken the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons npt 
and he is unwilling to rule out using a nuclear weapon against isis 
democrats want to reduce the number of nuclear chemical and biological weapons around the world as well as their means of delivery 
while retaining a strong deterrent as long as others maintain nuclear strike capabilities 
we will strengthen the npt push for the ratification of the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty and stop the spread of loose nuclear material 
democrats will be informed by a new nuclear posture review in determining continued ways to appropriately shape our nuclear deterrent 
with the aim of reducing our reliance on nuclear weapons while meeting our national security obligations 
democrats will also seek new opportunities for further arms control 
and avoid taking steps that create incentives for the expansion of existing nuclear weapons programs 
to this end we will work to reduce excessive spending on nuclear weaponsrelated programs that are projected to cost trillion over the next years 
climate change poses an urgent and severe threat to our national security 
and democrats believe it would be a grave mistake for the united states to wait for another nation to take the lead in combating the global climate emergency 
according to the military climate change is a threat multiplier that is already contributing to new conflicts over resources catastrophic natural disasters and the degradation of vital ecosystems across the globe 
while donald trump says that climate change is a hoax created by and for the chinese 
democrats recognize the catastrophic consequences facing our country our planet and civilization 
we believe the united states must lead in forging a robust global solution to the climate crisis 
we are committed to a national mobilization 
and to leading a global effort to mobilize nations to address this threat on a scale not seen since world war ii 
in the first days of the next administration the president will convene a summit of the worlds best engineers climate scientists policy experts activists and indigenous communities to chart a course to solve the climate crisis 
our generation must lead the fight against climate change and we applaud president obamas leadership in forging the historic paris climate change agreement 
we will not only meet the goals we set in paris we will seek to exceed them 
and push other countries to do the same by slashing carbon pollution and rapidly driving down emissions of potent greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons 
we will support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases 
deploy more clean energy 
and invest in climate resilience and adaptation 
as a proud arctic nation we are against putting the region at risk through drilling in the arctic ocean or the arctic national wildlife refuge 
instead while protecting our strategic interests we will seek collaborative sciencebased approaches to be good stewards of the rapidly changing arctic region 
our values of inclusion and tolerance inspire hope around the world and make us safer at home 
the world will be more secure stable and peaceful when all people are able to reach their godgiven potential and live in freedom and dignity 
we strive to ensure that the values upon which our country was built 
including our belief that all people are created equal are reflected in everything our nation does 
that is why we will promote peacebuilding protect democracy and champion human rights defenders 
and we will seek to safeguard vulnerable minorities including lgbt people and people with disabilities 
we believe the united states must continue to be a strong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world 
elevating their status is not just the right thing to do 
it is also a strategic imperative that advances american interests in prosperity and stability 
when women and girls are healthy educated and able to participate economically their families and communities prosper 
poverty decreases 
and economies grow 
and when women participate in conflict resolution and postconflict processes it improves the likelihood of securing sustainable peace 
democrats are committed to advancing the rights and opportunities of women and girls as a central focus of american diplomacy development 
and defense efforts and will continue to support the united states national action plan on women peace and security 
we will work to end the epidemic of genderbased violence around the world 
we will urge ratification of the convention for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women 
we will support sexual and reproductive health and rights around the globe 
in addition to expanding the availability of affordable family planning information and contraceptive supplies 
we believe that safe abortion must be part of comprehensive maternal and womens health care and included as part of americas global health programming 
therefore we support the repeal of harmful restrictions that obstruct womens access to health care information and services including the global gag rule and the helms amendment that bars american assistance to provide safe legal abortion throughout the developing world 
democrats believe that lgbt rights are human rights and that american foreign policy should advance the ability of all persons to live with dignity security and respect regardless of who they are or who they love 
we applaud president obamas historic presidential memorandum on international initiatives to advance the human rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons which combats criminalization protects refugees and provides foreign assistance 
we will continue to stand with lgbt people around the world including fighting efforts by any nation to infringe on lgbt rights or ignore abuse 
we will stop the scourge of human trafficking and modern slavery of men women boys and girls 
we will use the full force of the law against those who engage in modernday forms of slavery including the commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor of men women and children 
building on the accomplishments of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of we call for increased diplomatic efforts with foreign governments to root out complicit public officials who facilitate or perpetrate this evil 
we will also work to increase the provision of services and protections for trafficking survivors 
the majority of the developing world is under the age of 
these countries will be more prosperous and stable if young people have access to education and employment opportunities 
democrats will promote the rights of young people and nurture young leaders 
we will work with people around the world who seek greater opportunities 
including by promoting job creation 
expanding education and health care 
and fostering partnerships between peoples 
we are horrified by isis genocide and sexual enslavement of christians and yezidis and crimes against humanity against muslims and others in the middle east 
we will do everything we can to protect religious minorities and the fundamental right of freedom of religion 
the world is experiencing a major refugee crisis with more than million people displaced as a result of conflicts in the middle east africa and eastern europe 
we support president obamas call for an international summit to address this crisis so that every country assumes its responsibility to meet this humanitarian challenge 
while donald trump proposes banning muslim refugees 
we will look for ways to help innocent people who are fleeing persecution while ensuring rigorous screening and vetting 
democrats support progress toward more accountable governance and universal rights 
as autocrats and strongmen around the world crack down on civil society and imprison those who speak out to demand greater freedom 
we will continue to bolster groups and individuals who fight for fundamental human rights 
democracy 
and rule of law 
we will support strong legislatures 
independent judiciaries 
free press 
vibrant civil society honest police forces 
religious freedom 
and equality for women and minorities

democrats will protect americans citizens abroad 
we condemn the practice of unlawful detentions or imprisonment 
especially of journalists 
and civil rights activists

we will fight corruption 
promote good governance 
and support the rule of law 
we will also seek to close offshore tax havens which corrupt rulers individuals and corporations exploit to shelter illgotten gains or avoid paying taxes at home 
we will always seek to uphold our values at home and abroad not just when it is easy but when it is hard 
that is why president obama banned torture without exception in his first week in office 
and why democrats condemn donald trumps statements that he would engage in torture and other war crimes 
we agree with military and national security experts who acknowledge that torture is not an effective interrogation technique 
the democratic party remains committed to closing the detention facility at guantánamo bay and ending indefinite detention without trial or conviction 
keeping the facility open is a blemish on our record 
serves as a recruiting tool for extremists 
and undermines our standing in the world 
we believe that development assistance is an essential instrument of american power 
it can prevent threats enhance stability and reduce the need for military force 
with less than one percent of the federal budget our development assistance has helped cut extreme poverty in half 
drastically decreased maternal and child mortality 
reduced global hunger provided food security 
countered deadly pandemics 
promoted education 
and put an aidsfree generation within reach 
this investment reflects the best of america 
and makes us safer 
we need to continue this work and make more progress on important global goals like ending extreme poverty and hunger 
we will support local development efforts 
recognizing the selfdetermination of the peoples and countries we assist to direct their own futures 
we will also learn from recent conflicts to improve civilian capacity for conflict prevention and stabilization 
america has made critical investments in global health including in the areas of maternal and child health hiv and aids tuberculosis and malaria 
it is vital that we continue this work which has saved millions of lives around the world 
and is essential to our nations health security 
while the republican party refuses to fund important measures that could contain and address the zika pandemic 
democrats are ready to limit the reach of zikajust as we did with ebolaand support funding for diagnostic tests for the virus vaccine and treatment 
we will also prepare for potential pandemics like avian influenza and h n by working with first responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious diseases 
democrats believe an aidsfree generation is within our grasp 
but today far too many americans living with hiv are without access to quality care and too many new infections occur each year 
that is why we will implement the national hiv and aids strategy increase research funding for the national institutes of health 
cap pharmaceutical expenses for people living with hiv and aids 
reform hiv criminalization laws 
and expand access for harm reduction programs and hiv prevention medications particularly for the populations most at risk of infection 
abroad we will continue our commitment to the presidents emergency plan for aids relief and increase global funding for hiv and aids prevention and treatment 
democrats will always protect those living with hiv and aids from stigma and discrimination

and protecting american jobs 
we also believe that the world will be safer when there is greater prosperity 
that is why we will prioritize and strongly enforce provisions on decent work and workers rights in all american diplomatic trade and programmatic efforts

pursuing a global economic agenda that promotes rising wages 
and invests in quality public services 
workers rights 
and environmental protections 
we believe that we need to coordinate our economic actions with other countries to address economic insecurity 
specifically youth un and underemployment 
gender inequality 
the digital transformation 
and the transition towards green jobs 
american leadership is essential to keeping us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead 
it would be a dangerous mistake for america to abandon our responsibilities

a strong and secure israel is vital to the united states because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy equality tolerance and pluralism

and oppose any effort to delegitimize israel including at the united nations or through the boycott divestment and sanctions movement 
we will continue to work toward a twostate solution of the israelipalestinian conflict negotiated directly by the parties that guarantees israels future as a secure and democratic jewish state with recognized borders 
and provides the palestinians with independence sovereignty and dignity 
while jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations it should remain the capital of israel an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths 
israelis deserve security recognition and a normal life free from terror and incitement 
palestinians should be free to govern themselves in their own viable state 
in peace and dignity

all while he praises putin 
when the united states was attacked on september our nato allies invoked article of the north atlantic treaty stating that an attack against one is an attack against allfor the first and only time in its history 
our nato allies fought alongside us in afghanistan and are still there today 
we will maintain our article collective security commitments to nato because we are stronger when we have our allies at our side 
and we will continue to push nato members to contribute their fair share 
the americas are a region of singular strategic economic and cultural importance and opportunity for the united states

and respond to the will of its people 
and in haiti we will support local and international efforts to bolster the countrys democratic institutions 
and economic development 
we will also help more haitians take advantage of temporary protected status 
finally we will close the school of the americas now known as the western hemisphere institute for security cooperation because we believe that military and police forces should support democracy not subvert it

democrats will protect and grow the global economy 
while donald trump wants to default on our debt which would lead to a disastrous global economic crisis 
we believe we must be responsible stewards and work with our partners to prevent another worldwide financial crisis 
democrats believe that global institutionsmost prominently the united nationsand multilateral organizations have a powerful role to play and are an important amplifier of american strength and influence 
many of these organizations need reform and updating 
but it would be reckless to follow donald trump and turn our back on the international system that our country built 
it has provided decades of stability and economic growth for the world and for america
