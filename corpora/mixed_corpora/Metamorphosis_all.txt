more have been entirely wrong case 
gregor did fact apart excessive sleepiness sleeping so long feel completely well even felt much hungrier usual 
wa still hurriedly thinking unable decide get bed clock struck quarter 
wa cautious knock door head 
gregor somebody called wa mother it quarter 
didnt want go 
gentle voice 
gregor wa shocked heard own voice answering hardly be recognised voice had had 
deep him wa painful uncontrollable squeaking mixed in word be made first then wa sort echo made unclear leaving hearer unsure had heard properly not 
gregor had wanted give full answer explain everything circumstance contented saying mother thank you im getting now 
change gregors voice probably not be noticed outside wooden door mother wa satisfied explanation shuffled away 
short conversation made other member family aware gregor expectation wa still home soon father came knocking side door gently fist 
gregor gregor called whats 
short while called again warning deepness voice 
gregor 
other side door sister came plaintively 
arent 
do need anything 
gregor answered side ready now making effort remove strangeness voice enunciating very carefully putting long pause individual word 
father went back breakfast sister whispered gregor open door beg 
gregor however had thought opening door instead congratulated cautious habit acquired travelling locking door night even wa home 
first thing wanted do wa get peace being disturbed get dressed most have breakfast 
only then consider do next wa well aware not bring thought sensible conclusion lying bed 
remembered had often felt slight pain bed perhaps caused lying awkwardly had always turned be pure imagination wondered imaginings slowly resolve today 
did not have slightest doubt change voice wa nothing more first sign serious cold wa occupational hazard travelling salesman 
wa simple matter throw cover only had blow little fell 
became difficult that especially wa so exceptionally broad 
have used arm hand push instead only had little leg continuously moving different direction wa moreover unable control 
wanted bend then wa first one stretch finally managed do wanted leg others seemed be set free move about painfully 
is something be done bed gregor said so dont keep trying do 
first thing wanted do wa get lower part body bed had never seen lower part not imagine looked turned be too hard move went so slowly finally almost frenzy carelessly shoved forward force gather chose wrong direction hit hard lower bedpost learned burning pain felt lower part body well present be most sensitive 
so then tried get top part body bed first carefully turning head side 
managed quite easily breadth weight bulk body eventually followed slowly direction head 
had at last got head bed fresh air occurred let fall be miracle head were not injured became afraid carry pushing forward same way 
not knock now price better stay bed lose consciousness 
took just a much effort get back had been earlier lay there sighing wa once more watching leg struggled other even harder before wa possible think way bringing peace order chaos 
told once more wa not possible stay bed most sensible thing do be get free way sacrifice 
same time did not forget remind calm consideration wa much better rushing desperate conclusion 
time direct eye window look a clearly could unfortunately even other side narrow street wa enveloped morning fog view had little confidence cheer offer 
seven oclock already said clock struck again seven oclock there still fog 
lay there quietly while longer breathing lightly perhaps expected total stillness bring thing back real natural state 
then said before strike quarter past ill definitely have have got properly bed 
then somebody have come round work ask happened a well open work 
so set task swinging entire length body bed same time 
succeeded falling bed way kept head raised did probably avoid injuring 
back seemed be quite hard probably nothing happen falling carpet 
main concern wa loud noise wa bound make even door probably raise concern not alarm 
wa something had be risked 
gregor wa already sticking way bed new method wa more game effort had do wa rock back forth occurred simple everything be somebody came help 
strong people had father maid mind have been more enough only have push arm dome back peel away bed bend load then be patient careful swang floor hopefully little leg find use 
really call help though even apart fact door were locked 
difficulty wa not suppress smile thought 
while had already moved so far have been hard keep balance rocked too hard 
time wa now have make final decision very soon 
then wa ring door flat 
be someone work said froze very still little leg only became more lively danced around 
moment everything remained quiet 
not opening door gregor said caught nonsensical hope 
then course maid firm step went door ever opened 
gregor only needed hear visitor first word greeting knew wa chief clerk 
did gregor have be only condemned work company immediately became highly suspicious slightest shortcoming 
were employee lout wa not wa faithful devoted go so mad pang conscience get bed spend at least couple hour morning company business 
wa really not enough let trainee make enquiry assuming enquiry were even necessary did chief clerk have come did have show whole innocent family wa so suspicious only chief clerk be trusted have wisdom investigate 
more thought had made upset proper decision swang force bed 
wa loud thump wasnt really loud noise 
fall wa softened little carpet gregors back wa also more elastic had thought made sound muffled not too noticeable 
had not held head carefully enough hit fell annoyed pain turned rubbed carpet 
fallen down in there said chief clerk room left 
gregor tried imagine something sort had happened today ever happen chief clerk too had concede wa possible 
gruff reply question chief clerk firm footstep highly polished boot now be heard adjoining room

wa only later had become little more used everything wa course question ever becoming fully used situation gregor sometimes catch friendly comment least comment be construed friendly 
enjoyed dinner today say had diligently cleared away food left left most slowly became more more frequent often say sadly now everythings just been left there again 
gregor wasnt able hear news directly did listen much wa said next room heard anyone speaking scurry straight appropriate door press whole body 
wa seldom conversation especially first wa not way even only secret 
whole day talk mealtime wa do even meal spoke same subject were always least member family home nobody wanted be home wa question leave flat entirely empty 
very first day maid had fallen knee begged gregors mother let go delay

now gregors sister also had help mother cooking wa not so much bother no one ate very much 
gregor often heard unsuccessfully urge eat receive more answer thanks ive had enough something similar

observant sister only needed notice chair twice always push back exact position window had tidied room even left inner pane window open then 
gregor had only been able speak sister thank had do have been easier bear wa caused pain 
sister naturally tried a far possible pretend wa nothing burdensome longer went course better wa able do so time went gregor wa also able see so much better

day order spare even sight spent hour carrying bedsheet couch back arranged wa completely covered sister not be able see even bent 
did not think sheet wa necessary then had do wa take again wa clear enough wa pleasure gregor cut so completely 
left sheet wa 
gregor even thought glimpsed look gratitude time carefully looked sheet see sister liked new arrangement 
first day gregors parent not bring come room see 
often hear say appreciated new work sister wa doing even though before had seen girl wa somewhat useless frequently been annoyed her 
now father mother often wait door gregors room sister tidied in there a soon went again have tell exactly everything looked gregor had eaten had behaved time perhaps slight improvement be seen 
mother also wanted go visit gregor relatively soon father sister first persuaded 
gregor listened very closely approved fully 
later though had be held back force made call let go see gregor is unfortunate son 
understand have see 
gregor think maybe be better mother came in not day course day week perhaps understand everything much better sister courage wa still just child after all really not have had adult appreciation burdensome job had taken 
gregors wish see mother wa soon realised 
consideration parent gregor wanted avoid being seen window day few square meter floor did not give much room crawl wa hard just lie quietly night food soon stopped giving pleasure all so entertain got habit crawling wall ceiling 
wa especially fond hanging ceiling wa quite different lying floor breathe more freely body had light swing up there relaxed almost happy happen surprise even letting go ceiling landing floor crash 
now course had far better control body before even fall a great that caused damage 
very soon sister noticed gregors new way entertaining had all left trace adhesive foot crawled got head make a easy possible removing furniture got way especially chest drawer desk 
now wa not something be able do did not dare ask help father sixteen year old maid had carried bravely cook had left certainly not have helped had even asked be allowed keep kitchen locked time never have open door wa especially important sister had choice choose time gregors father wa not there fetch mother help her
