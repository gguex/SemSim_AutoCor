sidelight relativity ether theory relativity address delivered may university leyden doe come idea ponderable matter is derived abstraction everyday life physicist set idea existence kind matter 
explanation is probably be sought phenomenon have given rise theory action distance property light have led undulatory theory 
let devote little while consideration subject 
outside physic know nothing action distance 
try connect cause effect experience natural object afford seems first were other mutual action immediate contact 
communication motion impact push pull heating inducing combustion mean flame 
is true even everyday experience weight is sense action distance play very important part 
daily experience weight body meet something constant something not linked cause is variable time place do not everyday life speculate cause gravity therefore do not become conscious character action distance 
wa newton theory gravitation first assigned cause gravity interpreting action distance proceeding mass 
newton theory is probably greatest stride ever made effort causal nexus natural phenomenon 
yet theory evoked lively sense discomfort newton contemporary seemed be conflict principle springing rest experience be reciprocal action only contact not immediate action distance 
is only reluctance man desire knowledge endures dualism kind 
wa unity be preserved comprehension force nature 
trying look contact force being distant force admittedly are observable only very small wa road newton follower were entirely spell doctrine mostly preferred take assuming newtonian action distance is only _apparently_ immediate action distance truth is conveyed medium permeating space movement elastic deformation medium 
thus endeavour unified view nature force lead hypothesis ether 
hypothesis be sure did not at first bring advance theory gravitation physic generally became customary treat newton law force axiom not further reducible 
ether hypothesis wa bound always play part physical science even first only latent part 
first half nineteenth century far reaching similarity wa revealed subsists property light elastic wave ponderable body ether hypothesis found fresh support 
appeared question light be interpreted vibratory process elastic inert medium filling universal space 
also seemed be necessary consequence fact light is capable polarisation medium ether be nature solid body transverse wave are not possible fluid only solid 
thus physicist were bound arrive theory quasi rigid luminiferous ether part carry movement relatively small movement deformation correspond light waves 
theory  also called theory stationary luminiferous ether  moreover found strong support experiment is also fundamental importance special theory relativity experiment fizeau wa obliged infer luminiferous ether doe not take part movement body 
phenomenon aberration also favoured theory quasi rigid ether 
development theory electricity path opened maxwell lorentz gave development idea concerning ether peculiar unexpected turn 
maxwell ether indeed still had property were purely mechanical much more complicated kind mechanical property tangible solid body 
maxwell follower succeeded elaborating mechanical model ether furnish satisfactory mechanical interpretation maxwell law electro magnetic field 
law were clear simple mechanical interpretation clumsy contradictory 
almost imperceptibly theoretical physicist adapted situation standpoint mechanical programme wa very depressing 
were particularly influenced electro dynamical investigation heinrich hertz 
previously had required conclusive theory content fundamental concept belong exclusively mechanic 
density velocity gradually accustomed admitting electric magnetic force fundamental concept side side mechanic requiring mechanical interpretation them 
thus purely mechanical view nature wa gradually abandoned 
change led fundamental dualism long run wa insupportable 
way escape wa now sought reverse direction reducing principle mechanic electricity especially confidence strict validity equation newton mechanic wa shaken experiment beta rays rapid kathode ray 
dualism still confronts unextenuated form theory hertz matter appears not only bearer velocity kinetic energy mechanical pressure also bearer electromagnetic field 
such field also occur 
free ether also appears bearer electromagnetic field 
ether appears indistinguishable function ordinary matter 
matter take part motion matter empty space ha everywhere velocity ether ha definitely assigned velocity whole space 
is fundamental difference hertz ether ponderable matter which part subsists ether 
hertz theory suffered not only defect ascribing matter ether hand mechanical state other hand electrical state do not stand conceivable relation other wa also variance result fizeaus important experiment velocity propagation light moving fluid other established experimental result 
such wa state thing h a lorentz entered scene 
brought theory harmony experience mean wonderful simplification theoretical principle 
achieved this most important advance theory electricity maxwell taking ether mechanical matter electromagnetic quality 
empty space so too interior material body ether not matter viewed atomistically wa exclusively seat electromagnetic field 
according lorentz elementary particle matter alone are capable carrying movement electromagnetic activity is entirely confined carrying electric charge 
thus lorentz succeeded reducing electromagnetic happening maxwell equation free space 
mechanical nature lorentzian ether be said somewhat playful spirit immobility is only mechanical property ha not been deprived h a lorentz 
be added whole change conception ether special theory relativity brought about consisted taking away ether last mechanical quality immobility 
is be understood forthwith be expounded 
space time theory kinematics special theory relativity were modelled maxwell lorentz theory electromagnetic field 
theory therefore satisfies condition special theory relativity viewed latter acquires novel aspect 
k be system co ordinates relatively lorentzian ether is rest maxwell lorentz equation are valid primarily reference k special theory relativity same equation change meaning also hold relation new system co ordinates is moving uniform translation relatively k now come anxious question  why theory distinguish k system k system are physically equivalent respect assuming ether is rest relatively k system 
theoretician asymmetry theoretical structure corresponding asymmetry system experience is intolerable 
assume ether be rest relatively k motion relatively k physical equivalence k k seems logical standpoint not indeed downright incorrect nevertheless inacceptable 
next position wa possible take face state thing appeared be following 
ether doe not exist at all 
electromagnetic field are not state medium are not bound bearer are independent reality are not reducible anything else exactly atom ponderable matter 
conception suggests more readily according lorentz theory electromagnetic radiation ponderable matter brings impulse energy according special theory relativity matter radiation are special form distributed energy ponderable mass losing isolation appearing special form energy 
more careful reflection teach however special theory relativity doe not compel deny ether 
assume existence ether only give ascribing definite state motion 
abstraction take last mechanical characteristic lorentz had still left 
see later point view conceivability once endeavour make more intelligible somewhat halting comparison is justified result general theory relativity 
think wave surface water 
here describe entirely different thing 
observe undulatory surface forming boundary water air alters course time help small float instance  we observe position separate particle water alters course time 
existence such float tracking motion particle fluid were fundamental impossibility physics  if fact nothing else were observable shape space occupied water varies time have ground assumption water consists movable particle 
same characterise medium 
have something electromagnetic field 
picture field consisting line force 
wish interpret line force something material ordinary sense are tempted interpret dynamic process motion line force such separate line force is tracked course time 
is well known however way regarding electromagnetic field lead contradiction 
generalising say be supposed be extended physical object idea motion be applied 
not be thought consisting particle allow be separately tracked time 
minkowski idiom is expressed follows  not extended conformation four dimensional world be regarded composed world threads 
special theory relativity forbids assume ether consist particle observable time hypothesis ether is not conflict special theory relativity 
only be guard ascribing state motion ether 
certainly standpoint special theory relativity ether hypothesis appears first be empty hypothesis 
equation electromagnetic field there occur addition density electric charge intensity field 
career electromagnetic process vacuo_ appears be completely determined equation uninfluenced other physical quantity 
electromagnetic field appear ultimate irreducible reality first seems superfluous postulate homogeneous isotropic ether medium envisage electromagnetic field state medium 
other hand is weighty argument be adduced favour ether hypothesis 
deny ether is ultimately assume empty space ha physical quality 
fundamental fact mechanic do not harmonize view 
mechanical behaviour corporeal system hovering freely empty space depends not only relative position distance relative velocity also state rotation physically be taken characteristic not appertaining system 
order be able look rotation system least formally something real newton objectivises space 
class absolute space together real thing rotation relative absolute space is also something real 
newton no le well have called absolute space is essential is merely observable object thing is not perceptible be looked real enable acceleration rotation be looked something real 
is true mach tried avoid having accept real something is not observable endeavouring substitute mechanic mean acceleration reference totality mass universe place acceleration reference absolute space 
inertial resistance opposed relative acceleration distant mass presupposes action distance modern physicist doe not believe accept action distance come back once more follows mach ether ha serve medium effect inertia 
conception ether are led mach way thinking differs essentially ether conceived newton fresnel lorentz 
mach ether not only _conditions_ behaviour inert mass also conditioned_ state 
mach idea find full development ether general theory relativity 
according theory metrical quality continuum space time differ environment different point space time are partly conditioned matter existing territory consideration 
space time variability reciprocal relation standard space time perhaps recognition fact empty space physical relation is homogeneous isotropic compelling describe state function gravitation potential think finally disposed view space is physically empty 
therewith conception ether ha again acquired intelligible content content differs widely ether mechanical undulatory theory light 
ether general theory relativity is medium is devoid _all_ mechanical kinematical quality help determine mechanical and electromagnetic event 
is fundamentally new ether general theory relativity opposed ether lorentz consists state former is place determined connection matter state ether neighbouring place are amenable law form differential equation state lorentzian ether absence electromagnetic field is conditioned nothing is everywhere same 
ether general theory relativity is transmuted conceptually ether lorentz substitute constant function space describe former disregarding cause condition state 
thus also say think ether general theory relativity is outcome lorentzian ether relativation 
part new ether is play physic future are not yet clear 
know determines metrical relation space time continuum eg 
configurative possibility solid body a well gravitational field do not know ha essential share structure electrical elementary particle constituting matter 
do know is only proximity ponderable mass structure differs essentially lorentzian ether geometry space cosmic extent is approximately euclidean 
assert reason relativistic equation gravitation be departure euclidean relation space cosmic order magnitude exists positive mean density no matter small matter universe 
case universe necessity be spatially unbounded finite magnitude magnitude being determined value mean density 
consider gravitational field electromagnetic field stand point ether hypothesis find remarkable difference two 
be space part space gravitational potential confer space metrical quality be imagined all 
existence gravitational field is inseparably bound existence space 
other hand part space very well be imagined electromagnetic field thus contrast gravitational field electromagnetic field seems be only secondarily linked ether formal nature electromagnetic field being a yet way determined gravitational ether 
present state theory look electromagnetic field opposed gravitational field rest entirely new formal nature just a well have endowed gravitational ether field type example field scalar potential instead field electromagnetic type 
according present conception elementary particle matter are also essence nothing else condensation electromagnetic field present view universe present reality are completely separated other conceptually connected causally gravitational ether electromagnetic field also be called  space matter 
of course be great advance succeed comprehending gravitational field electromagnetic field together unified conformation 
then first time epoch theoretical physic founded faraday maxwell reach satisfactory conclusion 
contrast ether matter fade away general theory relativity whole physic become complete system thought geometry kinematics theory gravitation 
exceedingly ingenious attempt direction ha been made mathematician h weyl do not believe theory hold ground relation reality 
further contemplating immediate future theoretical physic not unconditionally reject possibility fact comprised quantum theory set bound field theory pas 
say according general theory relativity space is endowed physical quality sense therefore exists ether 
according general theory relativity space ether is unthinkable such space not only be propagation light also possibility existence standard space time measuring rods clock therefore space time interval physical sense 
ether not be thought endowed quality characteristic ponderable medium consisting part be tracked time 
idea motion not be applied 
geometry experience expanded form address prussian academy science berlin january 27th 
reason mathematics enjoys special esteem other science is law are absolutely certain indisputable other science are extent debatable constant danger being overthrown newly discovered fact 
spite investigator department science not need envy mathematician law mathematics referred object mere imagination not object reality 
occasion surprise different person arrive same logical conclusion have already agreed fundamental law axiom a well method other law are be deduced 
is reason high repute mathematics is mathematics affords exact natural science certain measure security mathematics not attain 
point enigma present age ha agitated inquiring mind 
be mathematics being after all product human thought is independent experience is so admirably appropriate object reality 
is human reason then experience merely taking thought able fathom property real thing 
opinion answer question briefly this  as far law mathematics refer reality are not certain a far are certain do not refer reality 
seems complete clearness state thing first became common property new departure mathematics is known name mathematical logic 
progress achieved axiomatics consists having neatly separated logical formal objective intuitive content according axiomatics logical formal alone form subject matter mathematics is not concerned intuitive other content associated logical formal 
let moment consider point view axiom geometry instance point space there always pass only straight line 
is axiom be interpreted older sense more modern sense 
older interpretation  every one know straight line point 
knowledge spring ability human mind experience collaboration other source is not mathematician decide 
leaf question philosopher 
being based knowledge precedes mathematics axiom stated above other axiom self evident is expression part priori_ knowledge 
more modern interpretation  geometry treat entity are denoted word straight line point 
entity do not take granted knowledge intuition presuppose only validity axiom such one stated are be taken purely formal sense 
void content intuition experience 
axiom are free creation human mind 
other proposition geometry are logical inference axiom which are be taken nominalistic sense 
matter geometry treat is first defined axiom 
schlick book epistemology ha therefore characterised axiom very aptly implicit 
view axiom advocated modern axiomatics purge mathematics extraneous element thus dispels mystic obscurity formerly surrounded principle mathematics 
presentation principle thus clarified make also evident mathematics such predicate anything perceptual object real object 
axiomatic geometry word straight line stand only empty conceptual schema 
give substance is not relevant mathematics 
other hand is certain mathematics particularly geometry owes existence need wa felt learning something relation real thing 
very word geometry course mean earth measuring prof this 
earth measuring ha do possibility disposition certain natural object respect namely part earth measuring lines measuring wands 
is clear system concept axiomatic geometry alone make assertion relation real object kind call practically rigid body 
be able make such assertion geometry be stripped merely logical formal character co ordination real object experience empty conceptual frame work axiomatic geometry 
accomplish this need only add proposition  solid body are related respect possible disposition are body euclidean geometry dimension 
then proposition euclid contain affirmation relation practically rigid body 
geometry thus completed is evidently natural science fact regard most ancient branch physic 
affirmation rest essentially induction experience not logical inference only 
call completed geometry practical geometry distinguish follows purely axiomatic 
question practical geometry universe is euclidean not ha clear meaning answer only be furnished experience 
linear measurement physic is practical geometry sense so too is geodetic astronomical linear measurement call help law experience light is propagated straight line indeed straight line sense practical geometry 
attach special importance view geometry have just set have been unable formulate theory relativity 
following reflection have been system reference rotating relatively inert system law disposition rigid body do not correspond rule euclidean geometry account lorentz contraction thus admit non inert system abandon euclidean geometry 
decisive step transition general co variant equation certainly not have been taken above interpretation had not served stepping stone 
deny relation body axiomatic euclidean geometry practically rigid body reality readily arrive following view wa entertained acute profound thinker h poincare  euclidean geometry is distinguished other imaginable axiomatic geometry simplicity 
now axiomatic geometry contains assertion reality be experienced do so only combination physical law be possible reasonable  whatever be nature reality  to retain euclidean geometry 
contradiction theory experience manifest rather decide change physical law change axiomatic euclidean geometry 
deny relation practically rigid body geometry indeed not easily free convention euclidean geometry is be retained simplest 
is equivalence practically rigid body body geometry  which suggests so readily  denied poincare other investigator 
simply closer inspection real solid body nature are not rigid geometrical behaviour possibility relative disposition depend temperature external force 
thus original immediate relation geometry physical reality appears destroyed feel impelled following more general view characterizes poincares standpoint 
geometry predicate nothing relation real thing only geometry together purport p physical law do so 
using symbol say only sum is subject control experience 
thus be chosen arbitrarily also part law are convention 
is necessary avoid contradiction is choose remainder p whole p are together accord experience 
envisaged way axiomatic geometry part natural law ha been given conventional status appear epistemologically equivalent 
specie poincare opinion is right 
idea measuring rod idea clock co ordinated theory relativity do not find exact correspondence real world 
is also clear solid body clock do not conceptual edifice physic play part irreducible element composite structure not play independent part theoretical physic 
is conviction present stage development theoretical physic idea still be employed independent idea are still far possessing such certain knowledge theoretical principle be able give exact theoretical construction solid body clock 
further objection are really rigid body nature therefore property predicated rigid body do not apply physical reality  this objection is mean so radical appear hasty examination 
is not difficult task determine physical state measuring rod so accurately behaviour relatively other measuring bodies be sufficiently free ambiguity allow be substituted rigid body 
is measuring bodies kind statement rigid body be referred 
practical geometry is based principle is accessible experience now try realise 
call is enclosed boundary marked practically rigid body tract 
imagine practically rigid body tract marked 
tract are said be equal another boundary tract be brought coincide permanently boundary other 
now assume tract are found be equal once anywhere are equal always everywhere 
not only practical geometry euclid also nearest generalisation practical geometry riemann therewith general theory relativity rest assumption 
experimental reason warrant assumption mention only 
phenomenon propagation light empty space assigns tract namely appropriate path light interval local time conversely 
thence follows above assumption tract also hold good interval clock time theory relativity 
consequently be formulated ideal clock are going same rate time place being then immediate proximity other always go same rate no matter are again compared other place  if law were not valid real clock proper frequency separate atom same chemical element not be such exact agreement experience 
existence sharp spectral line is convincing experimental proof above mentioned principle practical geometry 
is ultimate foundation fact enables speak meaning mensuration riemann sense word four dimensional continuum space time 
question structure continuum is euclidean accordance riemann general scheme otherwise according view is here being advocated properly speaking physical question be answered experience not question mere convention be selected practical ground 
riemann geometry be right thing law disposition practically rigid body are transformable body euclid geometry exactitude increase proportion dimension part space time consideration are diminished 
is true proposed physical interpretation geometry break applied immediately space sub molecular order magnitude 
nevertheless even question constitution elementary particle retains part importance 
even is question describing electrical elementary particle constituting matter attempt still be made ascribe physical importance idea field have been physically defined purpose describing geometrical behaviour body are large compared molecule 
success alone decide justification attempt postulate physical reality fundamental principle riemann geometry domain physical definition 
possibly turn extrapolation ha better warrant extrapolation idea temperature part body molecular order magnitude 
appears le problematical extend idea practical geometry space cosmic order magnitude 
course be objected construction composed solid rod departs more more ideal rigidity proportion spatial extent becomes greater 
hardly be possible think assign fundamental significance objection 
therefore question universe is spatially finite not seems decidedly pregnant question sense practical geometry 
do not even consider impossible question be answered long astronomy 
let call mind general theory relativity teach respect 
offer possibilities   
universe is spatially infinite 
be so only average spatial density matter universal space concentrated star vanishes 
ratio total mass star magnitude space are scattered approximates indefinitely value space taken consideration are constantly greater greater 
universe is spatially finite 
be so is mean density ponderable matter universal space differing 
smaller mean density greater is volume universal space 
not fail mention theoretical argument be adduced favour hypothesis finite universe 
general theory relativity teach inertia given body is greater are more ponderable mass proximity thus seems very natural reduce total effect inertia body action reaction other body universe indeed ever newton time gravity ha been completely reduced action reaction body 
equation general theory relativity be deduced total reduction inertia reciprocal action masses  as required e mach example  is possible only universe is spatially finite 
many physicist astronomer argument make impression 
experience alone finally decide possibility is realised nature 
experience furnish answer 
first seem possible determine mean density matter observation part universe is accessible perception 
hope is illusory 
distribution visible star is extremely irregular account venture set mean density star matter universe equal let say mean density milky way 
case great space examined be not feel convinced were more star space 
so seems impossible estimate mean density 
is road seems more practicable also present great difficulty 
inquire deviation shown consequence general theory relativity are accessible experience are compared consequence newtonian theory first find deviation show close proximity gravitating mass ha been confirmed case planet mercury 
universe is spatially finite is second deviation newtonian theory language newtonian theory be expressed gravitational field is nature such were produced not only ponderable mass also mass density negative sign distributed uniformly space 
factitious mass density have be enormously small make presence felt only gravitating system very great extent 
assuming know let say statistical distribution star milky way a well mass then newton law calculate gravitational field mean velocity star have milky way not collapse mutual attraction star maintain actual extent 
now actual velocity star can course be measured were smaller calculated velocity have proof actual attraction great distance are smaller newton law 
deviation be proved indirectly universe is finite 
even be possible estimate spatial magnitude 
picture three dimensional universe is finite yet unbounded 
usual answer question is is not right answer 
purpose following remark is show answer be 
want show extraordinary difficulty illustrate theory finite universe mean mental image which practice soon grow accustomed 
first all observation epistemological nature 
geometrical physical theory such is incapable being directly pictured being merely system concept 
concept serve purpose bringing multiplicity real imaginary sensory experience connection mind 
visualise theory bring home one mind therefore mean give representation abundance experience theory supply schematic arrangement 
present case have ask represent relation solid body respect reciprocal disposition contact corresponds theory finite universe 
is really nothing new have say innumerable question addressed prove requirement thirst knowledge matter have not yet been completely satisfied 
so initiated pardon part bring forward ha long been known 
do wish express say space is infinite 
nothing more lay number body equal size side side ever filling space 
suppose are provided great many wooden cube same size 
accordance euclidean geometry place above fill part space dimension construction never be finished go adding more more cube ever finding wa more room 
is wish express say space is infinite 
be better say space is infinite relation practically rigid body assuming law disposition body are given euclidean geometry 
example infinite continuum is plane 
plane surface lay square cardboard side square ha side square adjacent 
construction is never finished always go laying law disposition correspond plane figure euclidean geometry 
plane is therefore infinite relation cardboard square 
accordingly say plane is infinite continuum dimension space infinite continuum dimension 
is here meant number dimension think assume be known 
now take example two dimensional continuum is finite unbounded 
imagine surface large globe quantity small paper disc same size 
place disc anywhere surface globe 
move disc about anywhere like surface globe do not come limit boundary anywhere journey 
therefore say spherical surface globe is unbounded continuum 
moreover spherical surface is finite continuum 
stick paper disc globe disc overlap another surface globe finally become so full is room disc 
simply mean spherical surface globe is finite relation paper disc 
further spherical surface is non euclidean continuum dimension is say law disposition rigid figure lying do not agree euclidean plane 
be shown following way 
place paper disc spherical surface circle place more disc is be surrounded turn disc so 
construction is made plane surface have uninterrupted disposition are disc touching disc lie outside 
figure 1 disc maximally packed plane spherical surface construction also seems promise success outset smaller radius disc proportion sphere more promising seems 
construction progress becomes more more patent disposition disc manner indicated interruption is not possible be possible euclidean geometry plane surface 
way creature leave spherical surface even peep spherical surface three dimensional space discover merely experimenting disc two dimensional space is not euclidean spherical space 
latest result theory relativity is probable three dimensional space is also approximately spherical law disposition rigid body are not given euclidean geometry approximately spherical geometry only consider part space are sufficiently great 
is place reader imagination boggles 
nobody imagine thing cry indignantly 
be said be thought 
represent spherical surface well enough nothing analogous dimension 
figure 2 circle projected sphere plane try surmount barrier mind patient reader see is mean particularly difficult task 
purpose first give attention once more geometry two dimensional spherical surface 
adjoining figure let be spherical surface touched plane which facility presentation is shown drawing bounded surface 
let be disc spherical surface 
let imagine point spherical surface diametrically opposite is luminous point throwing shadow disc plane 
point sphere ha shadow plane 
disc sphere is moved shadow plane also 
disc is almost exactly coincides shadow 
move spherical surface away upwards disc shadow plane also move away plane outwards growing bigger bigger 
disc approach luminous point shadow move infinity becomes infinitely great 
now put question are law disposition disc shadows plane 
evidently are exactly same law disposition disc spherical surface 
original figure is corresponding shadow figure 
disc are touching shadow also touch 
shadow geometry plane agrees disc geometry sphere 
call disc shadows rigid figure then spherical geometry hold good plane respect rigid figure 
moreover plane is finite respect disc shadows only finite number shadow find room plane 
point somebody say is nonsense 
disc shadows are _not_ rigid figure 
have only move two foot rule about plane convince shadow constantly increase size move away plane infinity 
two foot rule were behave plane same way disc shadows 
then be impossible show shadow increase size move away assertion then no longer have meaning 
fact only objective assertion be made disc shadows is just are related exactly same way are rigid disc spherical surface sense euclidean geometry 
carefully bear mind statement growth disc shadows move away infinity ha objective meaning a long are unable employ euclidean rigid body be moved about plane purpose comparing size disc shadows 
respect law disposition shadow point ha special privilege plane more spherical surface 
representation given spherical geometry plane is important readily allows be transferred three dimensional case 
let imagine point space great number small sphere be brought coincide 
sphere are not be rigid sense euclidean geometry radius is increase in sense euclidean geometry are moved away infinity increase is take place exact accordance same law applies increase radius disc shadows plane 
having gained vivid mental image geometrical behaviour _l_ sphere let assume space are rigid body at all sense euclidean geometry only body having behaviour 
then have vivid representation three dimensional spherical space rather three dimensional spherical geometry 
here sphere be called sphere 
increase size depart is not be detected measuring measuring rods more case disc shadows standard measurement behave same way sphere 
space is homogeneous is say same spherical configuration are possible environment point 
space is finite consequence growth sphere only finite number find room space 
is intelligible only two dimensional case  if revert once more case disc surface sphere 
way using stepping stones practice thinking visualisation euclidean geometry give have acquired mental picture spherical geometry 
difficulty impart more depth vigour idea carrying special imaginary construction 
be difficult represent case is called elliptical geometry analogous manner 
only aim to day ha been show human faculty visualisation is mean bound capitulate non euclidean geometry
