outset shortly state position landscape painting animal painting hold higher branch art 
landscape painting is thoughtful passionate representation physical condition appointed human existence 
imitates aspect record phenomenon visible thing are dangerous beneficial men display human method dealing enjoying suffering are exemplary deserving sympathetic contemplation 
animal painting investigates law greater le nobility character organic form comparative anatomy examines greater le development organic structure function animal painting is bring notice minor unthought condition power beauty physiology is ascertain minor condition adaptation 
question purpose arrangement use organ animal le province painter physiologist are indeed more likely commend drawing dissection 
dissect animal generally assume form be necessary only examine is constructed drawing outer form attentively are led necessarily consider mode life is disposed therefore be struck awkwardness apparent uselessness part 
sketching day several head bird became vital matter interest know use bony process head hornbill asking great physiologist found appeared absurd question wa certainly unanswerable one 
have limited have just heard landscape painting representation phenomenon relating human life 
scarcely be disposed admit propriety limitation still le be likely conceive necessary strictness severity convince somewhat detailed example 
here are landscape turner greatest time  vesuvius repose vesuvius eruption 
is beautiful harmony cool color other hot are exquisitely designed ornamental line 
are not painted quality 
are painted state scene case is full delight men other pain danger 
is not turner object at all exhibit illustrate natural phenomenon interesting 
vesuvius eruption 
painting turner 
doe not want paint blue mist order teach nature evaporation lava stream explain operation gravity ponderous viscous material 
paint blue mist brings life joy men lava stream is death 
again here are sea pieces turner same period  photographs least 
is calm shore scarborough other wreck indiaman 
also are painted exquisitely artistic purpose first opposition local black diffused sunshine second decorative grouping white spot dark ground 
decorative purpose dappling poikilia is a studiously deliciously carried turner daedalus side him inlaying white spot indiaman deck were working precious toy ebony ivory 
turner did not paint sea pieces sake decorous arrangement did paint scarborough professor physical science show level low tide yorkshire coast indiaman show force impact liquid mass sea water given momentum 
painted show daily course quiet human work happiness enable conceive something uttermost human misery  both ordered power great deep 
easily  you must perhaps little time  suspect exaggeration statement 
is so natural suppose main interest landscape is essentially rock water sky figure are be put salt mustard dish only give flavor 
put head once 
interest landscape consists wholly relation figure figure human power conceived 
most splendid drawing chain alp irrespective relation humanity is more true landscape painting bit stone 
for natural philosopher is bigness littleness 
stone is just a interesting be  as wa time a big 
is more sublimity  _per se_  in ground sloped angle ground level perpendicular fracture rock horizontal one 
only thing make one more interesting landscape other is tumble perpendicular fracture  and couldnt tumble other 
cloud looked cloud only is more subject painting so much feculence dirty water 
is merely dirty air best chemical solution ill made 
is worthy being painted at all depends being mean nourishment chastisement men dwelling place imaginary god 
there bit blue sky cloud loveliest ever painted human hand 
mere pattern blue white had better have painted jay wing wa only painted reality only pleasant signifies coming gleam sweet sunshine windy weather wind is worth thinking only fill sail ship sun warms sailor 
now is most important convince yourselves fully enter truth difficulty choosing subject arises mistake 
daresay are fond sketching have gone out often most beautiful country yet feeling wa good subject be found 
always arises not having sympathy enough vital character looking physical picturesqueness instead 
contrary are crude effort landscape painting made continually most splendid physical phenomenon america other country history 
is not slightest 
niagara north pole aurora borealis make landscape ditch iffley will have humanity interpret feeling hedger ditchers frog 
next here is most beautiful landscape ever painted best have next greta tee 
subject physically is mere bank grass stream wych elms willow 
level topped bank water ha cut way down soft alluvion elevated plain limestone rock bottom 
had scene been america mortal have made landscape 
is nothing grass bank not very pretty tree scattered wholly grouping 
stream bottom is rocky indeed rock are flat dull yellow color 
sky is gray shapeless 
there absolutely nothing paint anywhere essential landscape subject commonly understood 
see landscape consists have told is most beautiful ever painted man 
there first little bit left nearly wild not quite wild there cart rider track copse then standing simply wild moss troopers ground scattered ruin great abbey seen so dimly seem be fading sight color time 
thing together wild copse wood ruin take back life fourteenth century 
one is border riders kingdom other peace ha striven vainly 
are remains past 
outhouse refectory abbey have been turned farmhouse is inhabited front mistress is feeding chicken 
see country is perfectly quiet innocent is trace fence anywhere cattle have strayed down riverside being hot day rest shade water 
not have done so ease had river not been humanized 
only little bit stony bed is left mill weir thrown across stay water perfectly clear delicious pool show clear is turner ha put only piece playing color picture reflection 
cow is white white red evidently a clean morning dew wash side 
not have been so country wa least coal smoke so turner ha put wreath perfectly white smoke tree not be enough show burnt wood ha made foreground piece copse just lopped new fagot standing still not being enough give idea perfect cleanliness ha covered stone river bed white clothes laid dry not being enough yet river bed be clean nothing else ha put quantity more hanging abbey wall 
_only natural phenomenon direct relation are be subject landscape 
rock water air more be painted own sake armor carved warrior 
but 
said landscape is be _passionate representation_ thing 
be done is say strength depth soul 
is indeed extent merely particular application principle ha exception 
are strong passion be painter at all 
laying paint insensitive person endeavor represent is not painting daubing plastering observe irrespective boldness minuteness work 
insensitive person daub camel hair brush ultramarine passionate one paint mortar trowel 
far more common passion is necessary paint landscape 
physical condition there are so numerous spiritual one so occult are sure be overpowered materialism sentiment is strong 
man is naturally likely think first anatomy painting pretty woman is very apt do so painting mountain 
man ordinary sense take pleasure feature have meaning easily take heath wood waterfall have expression 
need much greater strength heart intellect paint landscape figure many commonplace person bred good school have painted figure pleasantly even well none strongest  john bellini titian velasquez tintoret mantegna sandro botticelli carpaccio turner  have ever painted fragment good landscape 
missal painting exquisite figure drawing is frequent landscape background late work are elaborate only know thoroughly good landscape book have examined  i speak deliberately  thousands 
thing passion is necessary mere quantity design 
good art painting sculpture have again again told touch is necessary beautifully intended 
now fall compass ordinary application place rightly fold drapery gleam light chain ornament pattern come placing leaf tree painter get tired 
here instance is little bit sandro botticelli background have purposefully sketched slightest way see entire value depends thoughtful placing 
is texture aimed completion scarcely variety light shade mere care placing thing is beautiful 
well leaf cloud touch is placed same care great work is done john bellini picture peter martyr2 wa titian great peter martyr leaf wood get tired 
know other such landscape world wa 
footnote 2 national gallery no 
perhaps think such condition never paint landscape all 
well great landscape certainly not pleasant useful landscape provided only passion bring be true pure 
degree command genuineness depth source 
tintorets passion be reichenbach yours only little dripping holywell equally deep spring 
virtue painting and similarly sculpture other art is passion not have begin working passionately 
discipline youth work is cooling curbing itself discipline age is warming urging know bacchic chorus old men plato 
end life indeed strength man finest nature is shown due continence is finest nature remain young death first thing have do art a life is be quiet firm  quiet everything modest most essential modesty like landscape are going draw better expect like drawing it however succeed 
not rather have real thing sketch are not right state mind sketching all 
only think scene nice sketch make 
be assured never make nice sketch it 
think have produced beautiful work nay perhaps public many fair judge agree tell positively be enduring value have thus done 
think scene only get shadow scrawl carry glad be 
  then do be according strength good progressive be feeble much faultful be vital essentially precious 
now is not possible command state mind anything yourselves once 
nay probability eye are so satiated false popular art surrounding now side see delicate reality try even not care truth act did tell 
now therefore observe following quite plain direction 
set draw anything consider only best give person ha not seen place true idea 
use mean power do dont think person are drawing connoisseur person ordinary sense feeling 
dont get artist like quality him first give pleasant sensation being place then show land lie water run wind blow so on 
always think public moliere old woman have done nothing really great good please her 
now beginning wisely lose time labor learn paint condition quiet light sky attempt variable light cloud 
do not trouble yourselves allow yourselves be tempted effect are brilliant tremendous only beginning recommend watch always sunrise keep little diary manner have window small sketch book pencil cut night color moist 
indulgence have allow yourselves fast coloring time is endeavor secure record instant color morning cloud while are merely white gray blue get outline pencil 
soon feel mean are real difficulty be encountered landscape coloring eye be educated quantity harmonious action form 
rest  learn paint everything quietest simplest light 
first outline whole subject completely delicate sharp pencil line 
dont get more let outline be finished lovely diagram whole 
object are then be painted proper color matching a nearly manner missal is painted filling outlined shape neatly junction reenforcing afterwards necessary a little possible all knowing precisely light is is 
footnote make note point

angle subtended picture distance nearest object 
have brought old fashioned colored engravings4 are precise type style want begin 
finished corner corner a well painter easily could everything done good purpose nothing vain glory nothing haste affectation nothing feverish morbid excitement 
observation is accurate sentiment childish deep pure effect light common work quite curiously harmonious deceptive

are spite weakness absolutely only landscape show give real idea place put mind tone were happy ease take air light italy 
dwell necessity completion have lost much time sympathy feverish intensity mind great engraver always fastening point subject neglecting rest 
have seen then subject is be taken first terminal line then light shade then color 
first terminal line landscape drawing outline 
think example shell outline copying series already have made feel exact nature pure outline difficulty value 
have now deal limit more subtle kind 
outline simple solid form even have complex part represents actual limit accurately be followed 
outline cup shell animal limb ha determinable course pen pencil line coincides doe not 
say line is wrong right right is measure suggestive nobly suggestive character object 
greater number object landscape have outline so complex pencil follow a tree middle distance have actual outline all gradated softened edge most part cloud like 
even thing have determinate outline form is usually quite incapable expressing real character 
here is most ordinary component foreground instance pleasantly colored stone 
pure outline are not only beauty absolutely powerless give notion character character is so interesting here turner ha made picture little more heap such stone blue water oppose color 
consequence difficulty insufficiency most landscape painters have been tempted neglect outline altogether think only effect light color mass more le obscurely defined 
have thus gradually lost sense organic form precision hand respect limiting law word safeguard severe dignity art 
landscape painting ha therefore more consequence error other become weak frivolous justly despised 
now have chanced notice end queen air saying landscape turner be only guide perhaps have thought said so great power melting color massing light shade 
not so 
have always said is only great landscape painter be only guide is only landscape painter draw outline 
finished work perhaps appear more vague other master man loses outline more constantly 
be surprised know frankness losing depends certainty finding chooses other landscape painters study nature shade color turner always sketched point 
course is wide word 
copying series have put sketch turner color nature few others kind exist national gallery elsewhere 
rule boyhood last day life sketched only fine pencil point always outline more had time least outline scene interested general outline so subtle elaborate be inexhaustible examination uncopiable delicacy 
here is sketch english park scene represents average character study nature turner here sketch nature dumblane abbey _liber studiorum_ show took nature had time only get wa most precious 
first thing therefore have learn landscape is outline therefore now know precisely outline is be represented be right define quite general term applicable subject 
saw fifth lecture5 visible thing consisted space color terminated sharp gradated limit 
are sharp line separation followed point drawing instrument is proper outline subject represents limit flat space solid form 
footnote lecture art sec 
instance here is drawing holbein lady dark dress bar black velvet arm 
form is seen everywhere defined light perfectly sharp linear limit holbein accurately draw pen patch velvet are also distinguished rest dress linear limit follows pen just a decisively 
here therefore is first great law 
see space color distinguished sharp limit are draw limit firmly is outline 
also observe representing limit dark line is conventionalism just a much conventionalism line is subtle is thick great master accept declare conventionalism perfect frankness use bold decisive outline any 
also though are master art modify outline making dark part light others even sometimes thick sometimes slender scientifically accurate outline is perfectly equal first practice wish use always pen blunt point make hair stroke condition 
using black ink only movement pen not returning thicken line have line there not there not be able gradate change way degree 
first question respecting place is thick line have respect limit represents  outside inside over 
theoretically is be over true limit falling way center thick line 
contest apelles protogenes consisted striking true limit others line more more finely 
always consider pen line representing first incision sculpture true limit being sharp center incision 
practically are outlining light object defined dark one line go outside dark object light one inside 
drawing holbein hand being seen light outline go contour finger 
secondly 
is great importance 
happen constantly form are entirely distinct other separated true limit are yet invisible nearly so eye 
place instance egg front other probably most separation light is indiscernible 
is then be outlined 
practically combining outline accomplished light shade are case kind outline advantage even truth effect be omitted 
fact solid form are so vital importance perfect command so necessary dignity intelligibility work greatest artist even finished drawing like limit solid form fine line contour be visible eye not 
outline thus perfectly made absolute decision wash color is most masterly method light shade study limited time form object be drawn are clear unaffected mist 
wash color outline is most valuable mean obtaining such memoranda scene explain person record is most important feature 
choose then subject interest so far failure time material compels finish part express character rather course dwell feature interest most 
forget even somewhat repress make first object give true idea place other people 
are not endeavor express own feeling anything err side concealing 
is best is not think all state a plainly simply whole truth thing 
think unimportant person be most touching part think beautiful be truth commonplace small value 
quietly complete part best power endeavoring maintain steady dutiful energy tranquil pleasure workman

light shade 
last lecture laid evidence greatness master wished follow only guide landscape depended primarily studying nature always point is say pencil pen 
to day wish show preeminence depends secondarily perfect rendering form distance light shade admits thought color 
say however  observe carefully  only reference construction given picture not reference order learnt mechanical process 
beginning worked door point indoors brush attains perfect skill washing flat color long attains anything skill delineation form 
here instance is drawing wa year old dover castle dover coach future love mystery is exhibited studiously showing way dust rise wheel interest drunken sailor materially affected marine study shown not le occupant hind seat 
want observe is tree coach horse sailor are drawn schoolboy draw sky is washed so smoothly few water color painter day lightly accept challenge match 
therefore is many other reason put brush hand first try wash lampblack enter working class 
regard composition picture drawing is always first turner color second 
drawing is say expression gradation light form space 
again thus give statement wholly adverse vulgar opinion 
find statement early first volume modern painter repeated now work year vain 
nobody believe main virtue turner is drawing 
say main virtue turner 
splendid be colorist is not unrivaled color nay quality color ha been far surpassed venetian 
one ha ever touched exquisiteness gradation one landscape perfect rendering organic form 
showed drawing last lecture truly had matched color iron stained rock bed ticino care color at all take more le pleasure black green warm brown opposed 
essential value work is not these 
first expression enormous scale mountain space air gradation shade color be secondly perfect rounding cleaving mass alike mountain stone 
showed stone example uninteresting outline 
were ask paint color is pleasant enough still find uninteresting coarse compared flower bird 
engage endeavor draw true form light shade most assuredly find not only interesting point quite most subtle skill give 
have heard state several time master valued accurate form modeling found readiest way obtaining fact required be firm pen outline completed wash neutral tint 
method is indeed rarely used raphael michael angelo drawing have left study are nearly tentative  experiments composition imperfect careless pen outline suggested required wa capable easy change confusing eye 
master knew precisely laid touch paper were going do  and be are le greater men change le merely drawing natural object attempt composition greater knowing absolutely beforehand composition intend be even intend though better known is not so at all event anticipating power tintoret holbein turner think alone draughtsman tintoret rarely sketching all painting straight first blow holbein turner sketch indeed is pen iron point diamond 
find educational series6 many drawing illustrative method have enlarged here part is executed pen smaller drawing see fearless strength holbein delineates even most delicate fold veil head light muslin shoulder giving delicacy not thinness line exquisite veracity 
footnote ruskin drawing school 
eye endure patience even linger pleasure line is right however coarse faintest finest is wrong be forcibly destructive 
again again have recommend draw always were engraving line not be changed 
method used turner _liber studiorum_ is precisely analogous holbein 
line etching are tree rock building absolutely holbein are not suggestion contingent grace determination limit future form 
see explanatory office such line placing outline drawing stone line coincide limit shadow 
find intensifies explains form otherwise have escaped notice perfectly gradated wash neutral tint outline kind is is necessary grammatical statement form 
is great colorist need study think wasted time go farther have eye color go farther manner enjoyment 
now go back turner 
_first_ great object _liber studiorum_ requested sixth lecture7 make constant use is delineation solid form outline shadow 
yet more important purpose design book is expression such landscape power character have especial relation pleasure pain human especially pain 
is respect desired 
be assured not merely superiority absolute difference kind photography work disciplined design

blair athol 
painting turner 
do not know were interested enough little note catalogue view blair athol look scene summer ramble 
did found am nearly certain impression be only extreme wonder turner have made so little so beautiful spot 
projecting rock saw last am certain turner saw wa covered lichen having a many color painted window 
rather powerful deep highland river tilt  foamed eddied magnificently narrowed channel wild vegetation rock cranny wa finished arabesque living sculpture study mine made stream glenfinlas only few mile away give fair idea 
turner ha absolutely stripped rock beautiful lichen bare slate quartz vein running up it ha quieted river commonplace stream ha given rich vegetation only cluster quite uninteresting leaf clump birch ragged trunk 
yet have told ha put scene spirit scotland 
dumblane abbey 
painting turner 
similarly long vacation have ever stayed dumblane be think disappointed small degree study abbey showed sketch last lecture 
probably know oval window west end is prettiest piece rough thirteenth century carving kingdom used chief example lecture edinburgh know lancet window fine proportion rugged masonry alone form study ruined gothic masonry exquisite interest 
yet find turner representing lancet window few bare oval line hoop barrel indicating rest structure monotonous thin piece outline wa asked last term quite naturally rightly turner came draw so slightly  or even say so badly 
find turner stopping short apparently failing way especially doe contrary have been nearly sure do then is time look main lesson 
recollect quiet word strongest shakespeare hero one else have had sword instant keep bright sword dew rust 
were cue fight have known prompter 
footnote 
now always watch keenly turner 
see hand go hilt fast enough come 
dumblane abbey is pretty piece building enough is true virtue whole scene meaning is not masonry 
is much better masonry much more wonderful ruin dumblane abbey  tower aisle go arch building such are world 
look turner do cue is coliseum 
execution drawing is judge looking magnifying glass ivy battlement also cue is masonry 
then mean not so much indicating pebble joint wall dumblane 
wa sending other day friend america chosen group _liber studiorum_ form nucleus art collection boston 
warned friend once guard public sore disappointment first sight so much celebrated work be 
have make understand wrote first lesson be observing not turner ha done ha not done 
are not finished picture study endeavor is say get utmost result possible simplest mean are essentially thoughtful have fixed purpose everything else is sacrificed purpose is always get heart thing not 
now is true are beautiful lichen blair athol good building dumblane are lovely lichen all cold region world is far more interesting architecture other country scotland 
essential character scotland is wild thinly inhabited rocky country not sublimely mountainous beautiful low rock light streamlet sweet copsewood rudely growing tree 
wild land posse subdued imperfect school architecture ha infinitely tragic feudal pastoral civic history 
event history deep tenderness sentiment is mingled cruel barren rigidity habitual character accurately corresponding condition climate earth 
want especially notice respect thing turner introduction ugly square tower high up left 
first instinct be exclaim unlucky wa there all 
least not turner have kept sight 
ha quite gratuitously brought sight gratuitously drawn firmly line stiff drip stone mark squareness blankness 
is precisely blank vacancy decoration setting meager angle wind war want force notice take thoroughly italy greece put wholly barbarous frost hardened land once having gloom defined show more intensely pastoral purity innocence life loveliness nature are bank brae doune brooklet feed forth clyde 
is main purpose study 
is obtained various incident drawing stone tree figure show time 
chief element is sadness depth effect subdued clear light sky stream 
sadness effect repeat 
remember anything lecture gave last year be gradually getting accustomed definition greek school art essentially chiaroscurist opposed gothic color realist opposed gothic imagination despairing opposed gothic hope 
are prepared recognize condition 
only observe chiaroscuro is simply technical result others greek painter like light shade first enable realize form solidly color is flat secondly light shade are melancholy color is gay 
defect color substitution more le gray gloomy effect rounded gradation constantly express character first academic greek fleshliness solidity opposed gothic imagination secondly greek tragic horror gloom opposed gothic gladness 
great french room louvre at all remember general character historical picture instantly recognize thinking generally them rounded fleshly solid character drawing gray greenish brownish color defect color lurid moonlight like gloomy choice subject deluge field eylau starvation raft death endymion always melancholy usually horrible 
more recent picture painter gerome unite attribute singular degree all fleshliness materialism make study nude judgment altogether inadmissible rank fine art 
now observe never speak greek school certain dread 
yet have told turner belongs strongest men time developed art belong then remember so do basest 
learning academy is indeed splendid accessory original power velasquez titian reynolds whole world art is full base learning academy fool posse become tenfold plague fool 
again stern more le hopeless melancholy necessarily is under current mind greatest men homer aeschylus pindar shakespeare 
earthy sensual weak despondency is attribute lowest mental bodily disease imbecility lassitude follow crime nation individual only find last stimulus own dying sensation fascinated contemplation completer death 
highest basest have variety combination strength mistake mass foolish person dividing always oppositely equally erroneous faith genius dispense law law create genius 
is more excuse le danger first second mistake 
genius ha sometimes done lovely thing knowledge discipline 
learning academy ha never yet drawn so much fair face ever set pleasant color side side 
now is great northern painter have not spoken now probably surprise rubens power is composed so many element character be illustrated so completely various operation counter school picture now open study press set aside brightest easter afternoon study picture exhibition old master so called juno argus no 
so called say is not picture either argus juno portrait flemish lady a juno just rubens painted family picture wife a virgin a st george good anatomical study human body argus 
day rubens remember mythology wa thought mere empty form compliment fable original meaning wholly forgotten 
rubens never dreamed argus is night eye are star absolutely literal brutal part dutch nature supposes head argus full real eye all over represents hebe cutting bloody knife putting hand goddess unseemly oyster 
conception action loathsome sprawling trunk argus chariot are essential contribution rubens own netherland personality 
then rest treatment learned other school adopted splendid power 
first think be struck having large peacock painted scarcely color them 
are nearly black black green peacock 
know rubens is always spoken great colorist _par excellence_ colorist not have expected first thing have seen peacock have been gold blue 
see nothing kind 
peacock him is essentially dark bird serpent like writhing neck cloud like toss wave plume 
ha dashed filament feather magnificent drawing ha not given bright gleam green purple bird 
reason is rubens is not _par excellence_ colorist nay is not even good colorist 
is very second rate coarse colorist therefore color catch lower public get talked 
is _par excellence_ splendid draughtsman greek school one else tintoret have drawn same ease muscle dead body plume bird 
farther never became great colorist doe not mean not had chosen 
wa warped color lower greek instinct animal delight coarse violent form scenes  in fighting hunting torment martyrdom hell had higher gift him flesh had not subdued 
is part picture learned do venice iris golden hair chariot juno 
ha put full power teaching veronese titian ha splendid northern gothic reynolds gainsborough play feature venetian color 
scarcely anything more beautiful head more masterly composition inlaid pattern juno robe below exists art country 
sic know nothing else equal entire work rubens 
see then picture divide 
fleshly baseness brutality stupidity main conception is dutch part is rubens own 
noble drawing dead body bird have phidias greek part it brought rubens michael angelo 
embroidery juno robe have daedalus greek part brought rubens veronese 
head iris have pure northern gothic part it brought rubens giorgione titian 
now though  even had given minute digression  the lesson picture have been well worth have not taking gone own way 
is special point observe dark peacock 
look note venetian picture end stone venice find especially dwelt a singular tintoret picture nativity ha peacock color 
reason is also tintoret belongs full half mind rubens doe greek school 
men reach same point opposite path 
tintoret begin venice taught adopted athens teach rubens begin athens adopts venice 
look back fifth lecture9 find said colorist always adopt a much chiaroscuro suit so become perfect chiaroscurists cannot part adopt color partially 
accordingly tintoret chooses laugh rubens scorn management light shade rubens only here there  as far know only once  touches tintoret giorgione color 
footnote lecture art the inaugural course sec 
now observe farther 
greek chiaroscuro have just told is body men pursued academically mean expressing form tragically mystery light shade corresponding forming part joy sorrow life 
of course find purpose mingled pure formal chiaroscuro  marc antonios leonardos  is inconsistent color is thoroughly necessary exercise is only correcting guarding one never basis art 
let be sure now thoroughly understand relation formal shade color 
here is egg here green cluster leaf bunch black grape 
formal chiaroscuro are be considered white drawn were carved marble 
engraving meant telling wa formal chiaroscuro wa ball is white leaf are white dress is white tell color stand 
contrary colorist first question everything is color 
is white thing green thing blue thing 
down go touch white green dark blue first all afterwards make look round fruit leaf all very well cant blue green at least be 
now here have exactly thing done master are speaking 
here is copy turner vignette 
is wholly design colored school 
here is bit vine foreground purple grape grape so far being drawn are struck in angular flat spot are vividly purple spot whole vitality use design is tyrian nature 
here contrary is duerers flight egypt grape palm fruit above 
are white engraved look thoroughly round 
other great chiaroscurists named velasquez titian  approached shadow also safe side  from venice always think color first 
turner had work way dark greek school up venice always think shadow first held degree fatally end 
picture laughed were not fancied mad endeavor color were agonizing greek effort get light 
have got color easily enough had rested show next lecture 
still so nearly made venetian that opposed dutch academical chiaroscurists is be considered venetian altogether 
now show very simple subject exact opposition school 
here is study swan dutch book academical instruction rubens time 
is good valuable book many way are going have copy set 
type academical chiaroscuro give most valuable lesson other side  of warning 
here then is academical dutchman notion swan 
ha laboriously engraved feather ha rounded bird ball ha thought never swan ha been so engraved 
ha never dutch eye perceived point swan are vital it first is white secondly is graceful 
ha thing missed proportion necessarily therefore bend neck 
now take colorist view matter 
first main fact swan are is white thing black spot 
turner take brush right hand little white it left hand little lampblack 
take piece brown paper work about minute white brush pass black right hand work minute there are 
like be able draw swan minute half 
perhaps show how need year work day long 
first meantime draw rightly take hour instead minute above all remember are black white 
farther see intensely turner felt precisely fleming did not feel  the bend neck 
is not turner is colorist opposed fleming is pure highly trained greek opposed fleming low greek 
so far are aiming form are now working greek school phidias turner is true greek is thinking only truth swan de wit is pseudo greek is thinking not swan all own dutch self 
so ha ended making essentially piggish nature sleeping swan neck a nearly possible leg pork 
is result academical work hand vulgar person 
now ask look carefully more picture london exhibition 
first nativity sandro botticelli 
is early work quite perfect example master pure greek school did florence 
footnote now national gallery no 
greek main character know is be aprosopos faceless 
look first face picture find ugly  often expression always ill carelessly drawn 
entire purpose picture is mystic symbolism motion chiaroscuro 
motion 
is dome burning cloud upper heaven 
angel half float half dance circle lower vault 
drapery is drifted make feel whirlwind motion 
are seen gleam silvery fiery light relieved equally lighted blue inimitable depth loveliness 
is impossible ever see more noble work passionate greek chiaroscuro  rejoicing light 
like go instantly rembrandt portrait burgomaster 
exhibition old master 
is ignobly passionate chiaroscuro rejoicing darkness rather light 
see finer work rembrandt 
ha power rendering character portrait is celebrated world 
is entirely second rate work 
character face is only striking person like candle light effect better sunshine head titian ha character seen daylight instead gas 
rest picture is a false light shade is pretentious made chiefly gleaming button place light possibly reach embossed belt shoulder people think finely painted is all lump color not wa necessary 
embossed execution rembrandt is just a much ignorant work embossed projecting jewel carlo crivelli real painter never load velasquez no 
same exhibition 
finally rembrandt go little cima 
st 
mark 
thus have sandro botticelli noble greek school florence rembrandt debased greek school holland cima pure color school venice 
cima differs rembrandt being lovely botticelli being simple calm 
painter doe not desire excitement rapid movement even passion beautiful light 
hate darkness doe death falsehood more 
ha painted noble human creature simply clear daylight not rapture yet agony 
is dressed rainbow bedraggled blood 
are be alarmed entertained anything is likely happen 
are not be improved piety expression disgusted truculence 
is more true mastery light shade eye is subtle enough see hollow angle architecture fold dress etching rembrandt put 
unexciting color not first delight charm never fail work variously strained obtrusive power is surrounded find never return sense relief peace only be given tender skill is wholly pretense pride error

footnote lecture art sec 
know sometimes speak generally gothic greek school sometimes colorist chiaroscurist 
opposition are liable infinite qualification gradation specie animal not be troubled therefore sometimes momentary contradiction seem arise examining special point 
nay mode opposition greatest men are inlaid complex difficult explain clear 
thus know study sculpture saw essential aim greek art wa tranquil action chief aim gothic art wa passionate rest peace eternity intense sentiment 
go detail continually therefore have oppose gothic passion greek temperance gothic rigidity stasis ekstasis greek action 
see doubly intimately opposed idea are yet difficult explain apparent contradiction

madonna child 
painting filippo lippi 
look once more greek dancing girl is terra cotta therefore intensely school clay look madonna filippo lippi greek motion gothic absolute quietness greek indifference  dancing gothic passion word use frenzy love greek fleshliness hungry wasting self forgetful body greek softness diffused shadow ductile curve gothic lucidity color acuteness angle greek simplicity cold veracity gothic rapture trusted vision 
now safely think go work to day confusing only this 
find continually speaking men  titian holbein turner tintoret  in almost same term 
unite quality sometimes find referring colorist sometimes chiaroscurists 
only remember this holbein turner are greek chiaroscurists nearly perfect adopted color titian tintoret are essentially gothic colorist quite perfect adopted chiaroscuro 
used word prismatic just now school crystal being iridescent 
being studious color are studious division chiaroscurist devotes representation degree force thing  unseparated light colorist have function attainment beauty arrangement division light 
therefore primarily be able divide elementary exercise color be directed first exercise music clear separation note final perfection color are innumerable note hue one ha distinct office be fastened eye approved fulfilling

follows also law construction never be hesitation repentance direction line limit 
so not only beautiful dexterity joiner work necessity cutting piece color once forever for correct erroneous junction black white gray ha nature correct erroneous junction red green make neutral overlap is red green thus practice color educates once neatness hand distinctness will wrote long ago third volume modern painter are always safe hold hand colorist 
have brought little sketch to day foreground venetian picture is bit show precision method 
is head parrot little flower beak picture carpaccios series life st george 
not get curve leaf are patched spoiled parrot head however badly done is put more touch venetian gave show exactly method 
first thin warm ground had been laid whole canvas carpaccio wanted under current color just is under current gray loire drawing 
then strike parrot vermilion almost flat color rounding little only glaze lake attending mainly get character bird pure outline form were cut piece ruby glass 
then come beak 
brown ground beneath is left most part touch black is put hollow delicate line dark gray define outer curve little quivering touch white draw inner edge mandible 
are just touches  fine finest penmanship  to do beak yet find peculiar paroquettish mumbling nibbling action character nibbling beak differs tearing beak eagle is impossible go farther be more precise 
is only incident large picture 
let notice passing infinite absurdity ever hanging venetian picture line sight 
are very few person room be able see drawing bird beak magnifying glass is modern gallery picture be hung foot ground 
here again is little bit show carpaccios execution 
is signature only little wall lizard holding paper mouth perfect yet so small scarcely see foot not finest pointed brush copy stealthy action 
now think member class more readily pardon intensely irksome work put to compass ruler 
measurement precision are me thing just trained wholly chiaroscuro school know value color want begin color very outset see everything child see 
for believe final philosophy art only ratify opinion beauty cock robin is be red grass plot be green best skill art is instantly seizing manifold deliciousness light only seize precision instantaneous touch 
of course do so myself yet sketch mine made sake color is enough show nature value method 
are piece study color marble architecture tint literally edified laid edge edge simply paper stone are wall 
note thing especially 
testing rule gave good color element drawing is make white precious black conspicuous 
now see study moment white is inclosed properly harmonized other hue becomes somehow more precious pearly white paper am not afraid leave whole field untreated white paper all round it being sure even little diamond round window tell jewel are gradated justly 
again is not touch black shadow however deep study chose put piece black be conspicuous vengeance 
vignette copied turner have principle brought perfectly 
have white foaming water building cloud brought brilliantly white ground part subject is deep shadow eye once catch black point admitted front 
well first reason gave loire drawing wa infallible decision second wa extreme modesty color 
are other work know existing dependent effect low subdued tone favorite choice time day being dawn twilight even brightest sunset produced chiefly gray paper 
last loveliest all give warmth summer twilight tinge color gray paper so slight be question is there 
beg observe receive rule exception color be gay sad value depends never violence always subtlety 
be great colorist use utmost force color singer full power voice loud low virtue is case always refinement never loudness 
west window chartres is bedropped crimson deeper blood is a soft is deep a quiet light dawn 
say color be gay sad 
remember be other 
know told pure gothic school color wa entirety cheerful applied landscape assumes nature is lovely be clearly seen destruction decay are accident present state never be thought seriously thing never be painted is orderly healthy fruitful beautiful is be loved heart painted skill 
told also complete system art natural history landscape be formed system wrath wild beast tossing mountain torrent are equally impossible painter purist school higher field thought increasing knowledge mean increasing sorrow art ha complete sympathy humanity be chastened sight oppressed memory pain 
is reason system study be complete one be right profitable though incomplete 
find heart follow only gothic thought landscape deeply wish many reason 
first ha never yet received due development moment artistic skill knowledge effect became sufficient complete purpose reformation destroyed faith have been accomplished whole body powerful draughtsman reformation meant greek school shadow death 
so exquisitely developed gothic landscape count example finger hand van eyck adoration lamb bruges little van eyck louvre john bellini lately presented national gallery12 john bellini rome st george carpaccio venice are name great work

death st peter martyr 
now own practice this having first acquired skill exquisite delineation laying pure color day day draw lovely natural form flower animal missal painting choosing study natural scene only is beautiful strong life 
fully anticipated beginning pre raphaelite movement have carried forward method work broke piece pursuing dramatic sensation instead beauty 
day loveliest thing world remain unpainted have occasionally spasmodic effort fit enthusiasm green meadow apple blossom spare yet remains fact not england still le france have painter ha been able nobly paint so much hedge wild rose forest glade full anemone wood sorrel 
reason ha been idea such work wa easy part young men attempted total vulgarity want education great body abler artist rendering insensitive quality fine delineation universal law being draw pig not venus 
instance landscape painters much reputation england france also  david cox john constable represent form blunt untrained faculty being very frank simple apparently powerful needing thought intelligence trouble observe being wholly disorderly slovenly licentious therein meeting instant sympathy disorderly public mind now resentful trammel ignorant law  these men say represent intensity quality adverse accurate science skill landscape art work being mere blundering clever peasant deserving name school true practice consummately mischievous  first easy satisfaction painter own self complacencies then pretense ability blind public virtue patience difficulty precision 
is more real relation great school art more fellowship bellini titian humblest painter letter village signboard men 
do not therefore think gothic school is easy one 
more easily fill house picture constable garret cellar imitate cluster leaf van eyck giotto effort have been made paint common wild flowers have only very year just time show thing done rightly 
now observe flower beautiful are are not gothic school 
law school is everything be seen clearly least only such mist faintness be delightful have doubt best introduction be elementary practice painting study golden ground 
once compels understand work is be imaginative decorative represents beautiful thing clearest way not existing condition fact are producing jeweler work rather picture 
then quality grace design become paramount other afterwards substitute clear sky golden background danger loss sacrifice system clear sky golden light deep full blue full blue titian is just a much piece conventional enameled background were plate gold depth blue relation foreground object being wholly impossible 
is immense advantage byzantine gothic abstraction decisive form is joined faithful desire truth be expressed narrow condition 
make observe vital point character consists educates eye mind habit fastening limiting essential 
complete drawing is continually liable be led aside main point picturesque accident light shade gothic drawing get character all keenness analysis be constant exercise 
here beg very earnestly once all clear mind misapprehension nature gothic art implied error weakness instead severity 
style is restrained severe doe not mean is also erroneous 
much mischief ha been done  endless misapprehension induced matter  by blundering religious painter germany have become example opposite error english painter constable group 
uneducated men work too bluntly be ever right german draw finely resolutely wrong 
here is riposo overbecks instance painter imagined be elevated style had drawn light shade absolute decision so far indeed is gothic enough is separated everlastingly gothic other living work painter wa too vain look anything had paint drew mass drapery line were a impossible were stiff stretched limb madonna action a unlikely are uncomfortable 
early gothic art indeed find failure kind especially distortion rigidity are many respect painfully be compared splendid repose classic art 
distortion is not gothic intensity abstraction force character beauty color 
here is very imperfect illustrative border flower animal golden ground 
large letter contains indeed entirely feeble ill drawn figure is merely childish failing work inferior hand is not characteristic gothic other school 
peacock being drawn intense delight blue gold getting character peacock general sharp outline instead rubens black shadow is distinctively gothic fine style 
wish therefore begin study natural history landscape discerning simple outline pleasant color thing rest a long 
but only do condition  that striving also create reality beauty seek imagination 
be wholly impossible retain tranquillity temper felicity faith necessary noble purist painting are actively engaged promoting felicity peace practical life 
none bright gothic art wa ever done faith attainableness felicity heaven condition real order delicate loveliness earth

is turner dragon is michael angelos there very little carpaccios 
soul had understand creature very earnestly 
not michael angelo understands dragon others do 
wa not enough colorist catch point creature aspect feel same hatred confess always amazed looking michael angelos work here elsewhere total carelessness anatomical character only human body 
is very easy round dragon neck only idea have is is virtually more coiled sausage anybody round anything have full scale white high light black shadow 
look here carpaccio even copy 
colorist say all delicious paroquet wa ruby nasty viper be black then is question round off even is black make slimy yet springy close pool black blood earth  all same 
look michael angelos then tell venetian draw 
also carpaccio doe touch sweep brush minute most allowed beast michael angelo ha been haggling dragon neck hour

know have just been telling school materialism clay involved last cloud fire 
now down least detail method subject hold 
here is perfect type not complex one gothic landscape background gold tree drawn leaf leaf full green color  no effect light 
here is equally typical greek school landscape wilson  lost wholly golden mist tree so slightly drawn dont know are tree tower care color whatever perfectly deceptive marvelous effect sunshine mist  apollo python 
now here is raphael exactly two  trees still drawn leaf leaf wholly formal beautiful mist coming gradually distance 
well then here is turner greek school highest class define art absolutely first displaying intensely sternest intellect natural form then envelopment cloud fire 
only are sort cloud fire

thats cloud flame dragon mean let show dragon mean 
go back perfect landscape living gothic school

now burne jones landscape is clearly full light color glass light outline is prepared modification color 
plant grass is set formally grows perfectly be realized 
exquisite order universal eternal life light is faith effort school crystal describe complete work quite literally taking verse chaucer tender mood observing insists clearness brightness first then order

vegetation though beautiful is absolutely wild uncared seems human higher power having appointed law being leave spring such beauty is consistent disease alternate decay 
aesacus hesperie 
painting turner 
purest landscape _human_ subject is immortality soul faithfulness love turner landscape is death body impatience error love 
one is first glimpse hesperia hesperien patria cebrenida ripa injectos humeris siccantem sole capillos few moment lose forever 
other is mythological subject deeper meaning death procris

just now referred landscape john bellini national gallery best existing purist school being wholly felicitous enjoyable 
foreground indeed is martyrdom peter martyr john bellini look entirely cheerful pleasing incident doe not disturb even surprise much le displease slightest degree 
now next best national gallery is florentine one edge transition greek feeling distance is still beautiful misty not clear flower are still beautiful color blood foreground lie dead body procris disturbs poor painter greatly ha expressed disturbed mind figure poor little brown  nearly black  faun perhaps god faunus himself is much puzzled death procris stoop her thinking woeful thing find pretty body lying there breathless spotted blood breast 
footnote purist school 
remember told earthly power is necessary art wa shown flight daedalus greek herpeton minos 
look yourselves story procris related minos fifteenth chapter third book apollodorus see is faun is put wonder her having escaped artifice bestial power minos 
yet is wholly earth nymph son aurora not only leave her slay her myth semele desiring see zeus apollo coronis having same main interest 
once understand see turner ha put death deep shade tree sun withdrawing last ray ha put low type animal pain dog licking wounded paw 
now want understand turner depth sympathy farther still 
high mythical subject surrounding nature suffering is still dignified beautiful 
line master trace even seemingly negligent is lovely set meditative calmness make etching capable being placed most tranquil work holbein duerer 
cephalus especially note extreme equality serenity outline 
now here is subject wonder first turner drew at all 
ha beauty specialty picturesqueness line are cramped poor 
crampness poverty are all intended

scene is which old time swiss traveling all have known well little cascade descends road geneva chamouni village maglans subordinate ridge aiguille de varens known aiguillette 
none probably know scene now only object is get chamouni mont blanc down again valley cluse knew is worth many chamounis impressed turner profoundly 
fact spot are here given mere pure simplicity quite unpicturesque bridge few tree partly stunted blasted violence torrent storm root cottage mill wheel  this ha lately been pulled widen road  and brook shed rock finding way join arve 
scene is absolutely arcadian 
tradition greek hill purity were founded such rock shadow turner ha given birth shepherd hermes cyllene visible solemn presence white cloud hermes eriophoros forming heaven hill brook distilled it type human life born cloud vanishing cloud led down haunting hermes ravine then reflection cloud white sheep dog argus guarding them drinking stream
