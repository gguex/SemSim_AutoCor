footnote lecture art sec 

instance draw holbein lady dark dress bar black velvet round arm 
form see everywhere define light perfectly sharp linear limit holbein accurately draw pen patch velvet also distinguish rest dress linear limit follow pen decisively 
therefore first great law 
wherever see one space color distinguish another sharp limit draw limit firmly outline 
also observe represent limit dark line conventionalism much conventionalism line subtle thick great master accept declare conventionalism perfect frankness use bold decisive outline 
also observe though master art may modify outline make dark part light others even sometimes thick sometimes slender scientifically accurate outline perfectly equal throughout first practice wish use always pen blunt point make hair stroke condition 
use black ink one movement pen return thicken line shall either line may able gradate change way degree whatsoever
