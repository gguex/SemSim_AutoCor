There	EX

a	DT

which	WDT

Uncle	NNP

Dorothy	NNP
a	DT

There	EX

no	DT

a	DT
small	JJ

dug	VBN

a	DT

cellar,	NN
where	WRB
the	DT

go	VB
in	IN

one	CD

whirlwinds	NNS

mighty	JJ
enough	RB
to	TO
crush	VB
any	DT
building	NN
in	IN
its	PRP$

It	PRP
was	VBD
reached	VBN
by	IN
a	DT
trap-door	NN
in	IN
the	DT
middle	NN

the	DT
floor,	NN
from	IN
which	WDT
a	DT

led	VBD
down	RB

When	WRB
Dorothy	NNP
stood	VBD
in	IN
the	DT
doorway	NN
and	CC
looked	VBD
around,	RB
she	PRP
could	MD
see	VB
nothing	NN
but	IN
the	DT
great	JJ
gray	JJ
prairie	NN
on	IN
every	DT

Not	RB
a	DT
tree	NN

a	DT
house	NN
broke	VBD
the	DT
broad	JJ
sweep	NN
of	IN
flat	JJ
country	NN
that	WDT
reached	VBD
the	DT
edge	NN
of	IN
the	DT
sky	NN
in	IN
all	DT

The	DT
sun	NN
had	VBD
baked	VBN
the	DT
plowed	VBN
land	NN
into	IN
a	DT
gray	JJ
mass,	NN
with	IN
little	JJ
cracks	NNS
running	VBG
through	IN
it.	PRP
Even	RB
the	DT
grass	NN
was	VBD
not	RB
green,	JJ
for	IN
the	DT
sun	NN
had	VBD
burned	VBN
the	DT
tops	NNS
of	IN
the	DT

blades	NNS
until	IN
they	PRP
were	VBD
the	DT
same	JJ
gray	JJ

to	TO

everywhere.	RB
Once	IN
the	DT
house	NN
had	VBD
been	VBN
painted,	VBN
but	CC
the	DT
sun	NN
blistered	VBD
the	DT
paint	NN
and	CC
the	DT
rains	NNS
washed	VBD
it	PRP
away,	RB
and	CC
now	RB
the	DT
house	NN
was	VBD
as	RB
dull	JJ
and	CC
gray	JJ
as	IN
everything	NN
else.	RB
When	WRB
Aunt	NNP
Em	NNP
came	VBD
there	RB
to	TO
live	VB
she	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
young,	JJ
pretty	JJ
wife.	NN
The	DT
sun	NN

wind	NN
had	VBD
changed	VBN
her,	RB
too.	.
They	PRP
had	VBD
taken	VBN
the	DT
sparkle	NN
from	IN
her	PRP$
eyes	NNS
and	CC
left	VBD
them	PRP
a	DT
sober	JJ
gray;	NN
they	PRP

taken	VBN
the	DT
red	NN
from	IN
her	PRP$

lips,	NN
and	CC
they	PRP
were	VBD
gray	JJ
also.	RB
She	PRP
was	VBD
thin	JJ

gaunt,	JJ
and	CC
never	RB
smiled,	VBD
now.	RB
When	WRB
Dorothy,	NNP
who	WP
was	VBD
an	DT
orphan,	NN
first	RB
came	VBD
to	IN
her,	NN
Aunt	NNP
Em	NNP
had	VBD
been	VBN
so	RB
startled	VBN
by	IN
the	DT
child's	NNS
laughter	NN
that	IN
she	PRP
would	MD
scream	VB
and	CC
press	VB
her	PRP$
hand	NN
upon	IN
her	PRP$
heart	NN
whenever	WRB
Dorothy's	NNP
merry	JJ
voice	NN
reached	VBD
her	PRP$
ears;	JJ
and	CC
she	PRP
still	RB
looked	VBD
at	IN
the	DT
little	JJ
girl	NN
with	IN
wonder	NN
that	IN
she	PRP
could	MD
find	VB
anything	NN
to	TO

Uncle	NNP
Henry	NNP
never	RB
laughed.	VBD
He	PRP
worked	VBD
hard	RB
from	IN
morning	NN
till	IN
night	NN
and	CC
did	VBD
not	RB
know	VB
what	WP
joy	NN

He	PRP
was	VBD
gray	JJ
also,	RB
from	IN
his	PRP$
long	JJ
beard	NN
to	IN
his	PRP$
rough	JJ
boots,	NN
and	CC
he	PRP
looked	VBD
stern	JJ
and	CC
solemn,	JJ
and	CC
rarely	RB
spoke.	VBD
It	PRP
was	VBD
Toto	NNP
that	WDT
made	VBD
Dorothy	NNP
laugh,	VB
and	CC
saved	VBD
her	PRP
from	IN
growing	VBG
as	RB
gray	JJ
as	IN
her	PRP$
other	JJ
surroundings.	NN
Toto	NNP
was	VBD
not	RB
gray;	JJ
he	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
little	JJ
black	JJ
dog,	NN
with	IN
long,	JJ
silky	JJ
hair	NN
and	CC
small	JJ
black	JJ
eyes	NNS
that	WDT
twinkled	VBD
merrily	RB
on	IN
either	DT

of	IN
his	PRP$
funny,	JJ

nose.	NN
Toto	NNP
played	VBD
all	DT
day	NN
long,	RB
and	CC
Dorothy	NNP
played	VBD
with	IN
him,	PRP
and	CC
loved	VBD
him	PRP
dearly.	.
To-day,	RB
however,	RB
they	PRP
were	VBD
not	RB
playing.	VBG
Uncle	NNP
Henry	NNP
sat	VBD
upon	IN
the	DT
door-step	NN
and	CC
looked	VBD
anxiously	RB
at	IN
the	DT
sky,	NN
which	WDT
was	VBD
even	RB
grayer	JJR
than	IN
usual.	JJ
Dorothy	NNP
stood	VBD
in	IN
the	DT
door	NN
with	IN
Toto	NNP
in	IN
her	PRP$

and	CC
looked	VBD
at	IN
the	DT
sky	NN
too.	RB
Aunt	NNP
Em	NNP
was	VBD
washing	VBG
the	DT
dishes.	NN
From	IN
the	DT
far	RB
north	NN
they	PRP
heard	VBD
a	DT
low	JJ
wail	NN
of	IN
the	DT
wind,	NN
and	CC
Uncle	NNP
Henry	NNP
and	CC
Dorothy	NNP
could	MD
see	VB
where	WRB
the	DT
long	JJ
grass	NN
bowed	VBD
in	IN
waves	NNS
before	IN
the	DT
coming	VBG
storm.	NN
There	RB
now	RB
came	VBD
a	DT
sharp	JJ
whistling	NN
in	IN
the	DT
air	NN
from	IN
the	DT
south,	NN
and	CC
as	IN
they	PRP
turned	VBD
their	PRP$
eyes	NNS
that	DT
way	NN
they	PRP
saw	VBD
ripples	NNS
in	IN
the	DT
grass	NN
coming	VBG
from	IN
that	DT
direction	NN
also.	RB
Suddenly	RB
Uncle	NNP
Henry	NNP
stood	VBD
up.	.
"There's	VBZ
a	DT
cyclone	NN
coming,	VBN
Em,"	NNP
he	PRP
called	VBD
to	IN
his	PRP$
wife;	NN
"I'll	``
go	VB
look	VB
after	IN
the	DT
stock."	NN
Then	RB
he	PRP
ran	VBD
toward	IN
the	DT
sheds	NNS
where	WRB
the	DT
cows	NNS
and	CC
horses	NNS
were	VBD
kept.	VBN
Aunt	NNP
Em	NNP
dropped	VBD
her	PRP$
work	NN
and	CC
came	VBD
to	IN
the	DT
door.	NN
One	CD
glance	NN
told	VBD
her	PRP
of	IN
the	DT
danger	NN
close	RB
at	IN
hand.	NN
"Quick,	NFP
Dorothy!"	NNP
she	PRP
screamed;	VBD
"run	''
for	IN
the	DT
cellar!"	NN
Toto	NNP
jumped	VBD
out	IN
of	IN
Dorothy's	NNP
arms	NNS
and	CC
hid	VBD
under	IN
the	DT
bed,	NN
and	CC
the	DT
girl	NN
started	VBD
to	TO
get	VB
him.	PRP
Aunt	NNP
Em,	NNP
badly	RB
frightened,	JJ
threw	VBD
open	RP
the	DT
trap-door	NN
in	IN
the	DT
floor	NN
and	CC
climbed	VBD
down	IN
the	DT
ladder	NN
into	IN
the	DT
small,	JJ
dark	JJ
hole.	NN
Dorothy	NNP
caught	VBD
Toto	NNP
at	IN
last,	RB
and	CC
started	VBD
to	TO
follow	VB
her	PRP$
aunt.	NN
When	WRB
she	PRP
was	VBD
half	JJ
way	NN
across	IN
the	DT
room	NN
there	EX
came	VBD
a	DT
great	JJ
shriek	NN
from	IN
the	DT
wind,	NN
and	CC
the	DT
house	NN
shook	VBD
so	RB
hard	RB
that	IN
she	PRP
lost	VBD
her	PRP$
footing	NN
and	CC
sat	VBD
down	RP
suddenly	RB
upon	IN
the	DT
floor.	NN
A	DT
strange	JJ
thing	NN
then	RB
happened.	VBD
The	DT
house	NN
whirled	VBD
around	RB
two	CD
or	CC
three	CD
times	NNS
and	CC
rose	VBD
slowly	RB
through	IN
the	DT
air.	NN
Dorothy	NNP
felt	VBD
as	IN
if	IN
she	PRP
were	VBD
going	VBG
up	RP
in	IN
a	DT
balloon.	NN
The	DT
north	NN
and	CC
south	NN
winds	NNS
met	VBD
where	WRB
the	DT
house	NN
stood,	VBD
and	CC
made	VBD
it	PRP
the	DT
exact	JJ
center	NN
of	IN
the	DT
cyclone.	NN
In	IN
the	DT
middle	NN
of	IN
a	DT
cyclone	NN
the	DT
air	NN
is	VBZ
generally	RB
still,	JJ
but	CC
the	DT
great	JJ
pressure	NN
of	IN
the	DT
wind	NN
on	IN
every	DT
side	NN
of	IN
the	DT
house	NN
raised	VBD
it	PRP
up	RP
higher	JJR
and	CC
higher,	RB
until	IN
it	PRP
was	VBD
at	IN
the	DT
very	JJ
top	NN
of	IN
the	DT
cyclone;	NN
and	CC
there	RB
it	PRP
remained	VBD
and	CC
was	VBD
carried	VBN
miles	NNS
and	CC
miles	NNS
away	RB
as	RB
easily	RB
as	IN
you	PRP
could	MD
carry	VB
a	DT

It	PRP
was	VBD
very	RB
dark,	JJ
and	CC
the	DT
wind	NN
howled	VBD
horribly	RB
around	IN
her,	NN
but	CC
Dorothy	NNP
found	VBD
she	PRP
was	VBD
riding	VBG
quite	RB
easily.	RB
After	IN
the	DT
first	JJ
few	JJ
whirls	NNS
around,	RB
and	CC
one	CD
other	JJ
time	NN
when	WRB
the	DT
house	NN
tipped	VBD
badly,	NN
she	PRP
felt	VBD
as	IN
if	IN
she	PRP
were	VBD
being	VBG
rocked	VBN
gently,	RB
like	IN
a	DT
baby	NN
in	IN
a	DT
cradle.	NN
Toto	NNP
did	VBD
not	RB

it.	.
He	PRP
ran	VBD
about	IN
the	DT
room,	NN
now	RB
here,	RB
now	RB
there,	RB
barking	VBG
loudly;	RB
but	CC
Dorothy	NNP
sat	VBD
quite	RB
still	RB
on	IN
the	DT
floor	NN
and	CC
waited	VBD
to	TO
see	VB
what	WP

happen.	VB
Once	RB
Toto	NNP
got	VBD
too	RB
near	IN
the	DT
open	JJ
trap-door,	NN
and	CC
fell	VBD
in;	:
and	CC
at	IN
first	RB
the	DT
little	JJ
girl	NN
thought	VBD
she	PRP
had	VBD
lost	VBN
him.	PRP
But	CC
soon	RB
she	PRP
saw	VBD
one	CD
of	IN
his	PRP$
ears	NNS
sticking	VBG
up	RP
through	IN
the	DT
hole,	NN
for	IN
the	DT
strong	JJ
pressure	NN
of	IN
the	DT
air	NN
was	VBD
keeping	VBG
him	PRP
up	RP
so	IN
that	IN
he	PRP
could	MD
not	RB
fall.	.
She	PRP
crept	VBD
to	IN
the	DT
hole,	NN
caught	VBD
Toto	NNP
by	IN
the	DT
ear,	NN
and	CC
dragged	VBD
him	PRP
into	IN
the	DT
room	NN
again;	RB
afterward	RB
closing	VBG
the	DT
trap-door	NN
so	IN
that	IN
no	DT

happen.	VB
Hour	NN
after	IN
hour	NN
passed	VBD
away,	RB
and	CC
slowly	RB
Dorothy	NNP
got	VBD
over	IN
her	PRP$
fright;	NN
but	CC
she	PRP
felt	VBD
quite	RB
lonely,	JJ
and	CC
the	DT
wind	NN
shrieked	VBD
so	RB
loudly	RB
all	RB
about	IN
her	PRP
that	IN
she	PRP
nearly	RB
became	VBD
deaf.	JJ
At	IN
first	RB
she	PRP
had	VBD
wondered	VBN
if	IN
she	PRP
would	MD
be	VB
dashed	VBN
to	IN

when	WRB
the	DT

fell	VBD
again;	,

as	IN
the	DT
hours	NNS
passed	VBD

nothing	NN

happened,	VBD
she	PRP
stopped	VBD
worrying	VBG

resolved	VBD
to	TO

see	VB
what	WP
the	DT

At	IN
last	RB
she	PRP
crawled	VBD
over	IN

lay	VB
down	RP
upon	IN
it;	:

Toto	NNP

In	IN

Dorothy	NNP

Chapter	NN
