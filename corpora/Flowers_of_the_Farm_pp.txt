chapter iii flower wall behind narrow strip ground flower shrubs side drive low stone wall 
piece lawn mulberry tree stand cut away flight step lead little gate foldyard 
wall garden foldyard old roughnot like smooth brick wall see town 
stone different shape size mortar fall many place hole crevice 
yet beautiful old wall many thing grow moss grass flower 
may morning see also smell one flower grow upon wallit beautiful sweetscented wallflower 
grows along top wall plant even spring side 
plant quite large stem tough 
grow long time 
wallflower perennial plant unless kill torn root live grow many year 
others quite young inch high 
grown seed drop last autumn old plant 
likely wonder wallflower plant grow upon wall earth seennothing stone crumble mortar 
pull one small plant shall find earth cling root 
dry dusty earth blow upon wall wind lodge chink hole 
dust soil mixed mortar wall build dead leaf fall decay produce little morefor decayed leaf make earth soil 
wallflower plant grow wall rock find little soil sufficient need 
blossom wallflower upon wall golden yellow colour sweet 
blossom however darker yellow others petal quite brown 
look garden behind u shall see mrs hammond several bed wallflower year flower fond 
wallflower two different colour bed 
one kind bright golden blossom rather deeper colour upon wall flower rich dark brown 
plant sturdy bushy upon wall flower plant 
flower finer strong scent 
mr hammond wish could sow seed produce many different shade brown yellow wallflower 
might also purple wallflower even wallflower pale yellow almost white 
clever gardener plenty time patience could get purple nearly white wallflower yellowflowered plant upon wall 
would perhaps take u many year succeed last 
set 
suppose wish wallflower nearly white 
look carefully along wall spring blossom find palest yellow blossom could see 
mark plant flower seed ripe collect seed 
among plant grow seed choose plant palest flower save seed 
might go twenty year time wallflower pale almost white 
quite white never get wallflower pure white flower obtain yellow one 
however pale wallflower might would still always tinge yellow cream colour 
hand want purple dark brown wallflower save seed blossom near colour wanteddark brown tinge purple 
sow seed dark blossom last get wish 
besides choose seed light darkest blossom tend plant carefully well give plenty good rich soil 
would make grow bushy many flower see mrs hammonds garden bed 
many garden flower produce way select improve wild flower 
course flower grow wild somewhere england many foreign country air warm soil richer well 
pansy little english wild flower yellow blue red petal 
little flower gardener produce large beautiful pansy many different colour shade colourswhite yellow blue brown 
do careful selection speak wallflower 
large singlecoloured pansy tell mrs hammonds dark brown wallflower allow seed themselvesthat allow drop sow seed year yeardo know would happen 
would gradually revert turn back original form colour 
flower would become mixed colour less fine size last would simple wild flower 
june blossom wallflower fade fallen 
old wall however grow gay another plantthe red valerian 
must careful remember red valerian valerian 
great valerian grow wall rock damp shady place flower pale pink 
blossom red valerian wall bright crimson grow row small stem spring stout stalk foot two height

pull plant red valerian wall find root long branch need plant often grow rock place expose wind 
root firm hold tall stem laden blossom might blow 
red valerian flower summer 
cluster crimson flower great ornament old wall wallflower may

turn leaf two see side dark purple 
little plant usually say prefer damp situation blossom may till october 
wall beside step certainly rather damp moisture garden soak 
garden however ivyleaved toadflax grows dry old wall find flower middle december 
neither toadflax red valerian really native england 
brought country many hundred year ago

top stem cluster handsome rosyred flower 
blossom starshaped fully open generally twelve petal 
could see roots find threadlike fibrous like flower look today 
think well show root however pull plant would please ben cowman 
belief country place bad luck disturb houseleekthat someone house grow sure die soon afterwards 
certainly plant grow house hereonly calve cot 
still misfortune happen calf might blame ben 
besides would pity disturb handsome plant would

chapter iv three handsome weed end drive near front door another white gate lead nag stable mr hammond keep two horse rid drive 
billy old brown pony little stable close granary poultry yard 
perhaps hear say ill weed grow apace 
certainly true one plant call weed grow quickly well wherever allow remain 
shall far look three weed want show morning 
first sting nettle 
grows round woodpile middle poultryyard great clump beside hedge divide poultryyard kitchen garden 
really handsome plant though may think 
look tall straight stem evenly regularly dark green point leaf grow 
grow pair opposite side stem serrate 
something rather unusual stem nettle notice 
bring pair thick leather glove pick stem without stung 
know shape trunk tree 
round 
yes round nearly 
stem plant stem red valerian round 
stem nettle however square perfectly square four distinct side 
perhaps never notice nettle certainly plant one care much 
stem leaf cover tiny hair 
hair really small hollow tube end sharp point 
nettle sting first prick skin sharp point drop poison fall tube wound point make 
happen get stung nettle bathe hand cold water make pain worse 
wait pain pas remember india nettle whose sting cause great pain last several day 
might much bad see 
small greenishyellow flower sting nettle grow long feathery cluster stalk spring main stem close pair leaf 
young leave nettle say nice boil vegetable say ever eaten 
year ago country people use take great deal nettle tea medicine spring 
nowadays seem prefer patent medicine chemist shop 
dye make root nettle another dye stem leaf 
young leave top chop good poultry especially turkey 
nettle useful seenot merely sting weed 
nettle relation hemp plant get string rope 
may sometimes see hear white red yellow dead nettle really nettle 
leaf somewhat similar quite different plant 
hang great patch nettle hedge another weed traveller joy old man beard 
stem climb hedge high hawthorn bush stand 
many small white feathery flower pleasant scent 
leaf stem usually five leaflet one end stem two pair low 
leaf stem long tough chiefly plant climb twine round branch twig touch give traveller joy firm support 
see tree wood cover plant height twenty foot ground 
autumn early winter would admire traveller joy much 
flower certainly go seed take place blossom little plume silky white thread attach ita sort feathery tail 
serve wing seed often carry long distance wind 
seed plant shall see something kind 
another climbing plant hedge large bindweed convolvulus 
look however go round garden mr hammond care see 
certainly beautiful plant large threesided pointed leaf great pure white bellshaped flowerssomething like mouth trumpet 
farmhouse garden however certainly weeda plant wrong place 
see 
close hedge gooseberry currant bush bindweed climbed 
bindweed stem twin round stem branch bush till almost hidden bent weight 
bindweed climb see twist stem round tree cling though climb plant stem grow foot ground without support 
shoot bindweed two three foot away stem fruit bush grow unsupported till could reach overhang bough cling 
every dan look garden time cut oft bindweed close ground pull root fresh shoot soon appear 
little use dig ground near bush bindweed twist among root 
think bindweed traveller joy beautiful flower 
time plant far troublesome dangerous weed sting nettle 
nearly plant cling plant harm prevent stem bough cling swell freely 
see tightly bindweed stem twist round bough currant bush 
ivy bindweed cling plant often kill seriously injure valuable tree way 
chapter v clover say could make admire nettle see handsome even useful plant 
afraid however care much see gather handful take home 
go dinner presently mrs hammond say green pea nettletops 
believe would say pea please 
well look flower may like good 
go ashmead cow graze find clover 
mr hammond grow clover field every year 
willow farm walk farmer field know saw bailiff sow clover broadcast 
besides field clover however always plenty grow among meadow grass 
find directly go gate ashmead 
plant bright purplishred blossom 
let u sit examine carefully

pull stalk blossom put low end lip 
quite sweet like sugar 
nearly flower contain honey rather nectar bee make honey 
flower much nectar less none clover contain great deal 
look leave three leaflet 
find leaf four leaflet country child think fortunate fourleaved clover say bring good luck fourleaved shamrock ireland 
fourleaved clover however rather rare hope may find one rather afraid 
another clover quite handsome red clover look flower white rather small 
white dutch clover 
perennial plant one spread great deal ground allow 
saw remember ivyleaved toadflax wall foldyard step send fresh root stem grow 
white clover 
stem creep along ground send fresh root way plant spread quickly 
keep stem clover hand go little lane 
field shall see something even country people see every day 
clover farmer usually sow either red clover white else another kind call alsike 
year mr hammond sown field fourth kindcrimson clover 
ever see beautiful sight 
whole field blaze rich crimson colour 
shall never forget day first saw field crimson clover 
delighted ask farmernot mr hammond another friendif would field admire every year 
say would tell 
end year say find useful food animal red white clover sow againat least soon 
see pretty thing always useful 
let u see difference find three clover gather 
look first blossom 
red clover say like little round ball knob 
flower white clover much shape less fine 
flower crimson clover altogether different shape 
indeed many small crimson stem form round ball 
arrange form little circular cone pyramid large bottom point top 
difference 
immediately flower red clover pair leave blossom say sessile seat leaf 
leaf also blossom grow stem 
look white clover 
blossom grow stalk without leaf blossom itonly single blossom top stalk 
blossom crimson clover leaf 
today easily distinguish one clover others flower 
suppose however look day flower 
difference leaf 
three leaf form three leafletsthey trefoilsbut leave otherwise different 
red clover grow stem branch flower stem sometimes flower stem 
leaf stem hairy leaf generally white mark something shape horseshoe 
leaf white clover grow like flower top stema single leaf stem 
side leave smooth glossy 
leaf crimson clover grow flower stem like red clover leaflet broad rounder red clover leaflet 
crimson clover annual others perennial 
clover good food farmer animal stock 
red clover perhaps useful 
bee however prefer white clover easily get nectar 
sheep exceedingly fond clover mr hammond always careful turn field clover hungry let stray accident 
got would eat ravenously many would likely die 
hearty meal clover effect great quantity new bread would 
spend much time morning look clover minute two stand gate field bean 
blossom prettywhite dark spotsand fragrant 
field bean flower give u one delightful country scent 
chapter vi ashmead many flower besides clover ashmead today afternoon look grow among grass 
one may perhaps call weed yet one beautiful wild flower england 
mean golden dandelion 
lawn garden bed would certainly weed troublesome one 
among grass need think lovely flower 
see rich golden yellow little floret blossom 
plant like dandelion blossom compose number floret call composite plant 
examine plant closely shall find stalk bear blossom long deeply indented leaf grows like flowerstem leaf primrose short underground stem 
indent leaf dandelion get name 
leaf something appearance teeth lion 
french name lion tooth dent de lion english corrupt dandelion flowerstem round pull one see hollow tube 
bite piece stalk clover blossom 
difference 
clover quite sweet dandelion bitter 
may like taste perhaps white milkylooking juice quite wholesome 
dandelion tea dandelion beer often make country people leave give pleasant flavour salad

afraid unless care go back house fork trowel 
dandelion long strong roottaprootwhich go deep ground tall main stem take holdthe leaf flower stalk break hand 
stalk flower fall leave seed 
remind 
traveller joy autumn 
yes dandelion call pappus attach seed rather similar feathery tail traveller joy 
make dandelion troublesome weed seed easily carry wind patch dandelion allow go seed produce fresh plant quite far away 
seed scatter head like round white fluffy ball 
daisy dainty white floret often ting pink 
centre blossom yellow spot 
every night white floret fold yellow centre open morning 
fact explain u daisys name day eye open dawn shuts night 
daisy little flower everyone know love yet wrong place weed 
perennial spread fast 
course perennial annual spread mean seed perennial also spread way well 
see daisy 
pocket knife easily dug plant 
root small compact long like dandelion 
try lift daisy plant grass find still hold stout tough thread branch root 
thread connect another daisy plant one another thread connect third plant 
last get plant clear away ground three hang thread 
daisy spread throw threadlike shoot root grow another root plant 
knew well find far many daisy lawn home find long ago way spread fast 
daisy allow increase way form large clump smother kill grass 
notice flowerstem leaf daisy spring short underground stem dandelion 
daisy dandelion plentiful ashmead yellow buttercup 
however quite many buttercup might think first 
real name call buttercup bulbous crowfoot also meadow crowfoot field 
third crowfoot corn crowfoot 
today notice one two difference two plant see 
blossom plant five smooth shin yellow petal 
see however bulbous crowfoot buttercup form real cup petal meadow crowfoot spread almost flat 
meadow crowfoot grow two three foot high buttercup shorter plant 
flower pretty afraid say either plant 
bitter unwholesome horse cattle avoid eating 
people even say carry bunch stem make hand sore think look admire flower grow 
cowslip different plant indeed call weed 
even mr hammond sorry see fond glass sweet cowslip wine mr hammond make busy take home large basketful droop blossom 
set work however let u examine plant 
look stalk cowslip blossom see something peculiar oncesomething unlike flower see 
six seven droop blossom grow stalk pick grow top stalk 
point top stalk blossom grow call umbel 
blossom five yellow petal join together form corolla

yes primrose five pale yellow petal rather large cowslip join together form corolla grow long green calyx 
also petal spot darker yellow centre blossom 
leaf primrose cowslip much wrinkle grow short underground stem 
say primrose blossom grow alone top long stem 
yes dug primrose plant find several flower stem grow pointthe top short stem hardly appear ground 
grow umbel primrose closely related cowslip

cowslip grow short stem longstemmed umbel 
chapter vii hayfield hayfield end june 
really hayfield yet soon grass cut hay 
do day must lose time wish look flower cut 
must stroll field ashmead long grass trample difficult machine cut 
quite near gate however plenty flower shall find others step carefully along side hedge 
look first flower important farmer flower grass 
saw remember grass flower rise wallflower 
thought flower grass would alike see quite mistaken many different grass flower 
flower different stem also leave blade 
mr hammond could come field early spring autumn grass flower could tell kind grass blade belong 
today shall easily distinguish different kind grass flower though also notice difference stem leaf 
let u pick stem culm grass 
see great part hollow interval joint stem solid 
joint grows leafsheath wrap round stem little distance joint 
sheath grows leaf 
grass leave long narrow compare plant grass leave long narrow others 
flower 
stem pick stem perennial rye grass 
blossom see consist several small spikelet eighteen stem 
grow alternately two opposite side stem first one one side one 
stalk sessile seat stem 
spikelet flat grow two side stem stem look press book perhaps sometimes pressed flower 
leaf dark green glossy shining 
side leaf prominent rib extends whole length 
rib one sign mr hammond tell blade rye grass without see flower 
one farmer useful grass 
form close thick carpet sward trodden animal graze well seem thrive 
another excellent grass flower quite different appearance last 
call timothy grass 
first cultivate america man name timothy hanson always know christian name 
mr hammond know know good many farmer plenty timothy grass field know reason name 
spikelet timothy small grow dense cluster end stem blossom form kind tail 
indeed timothy sometimes call meadow catstail name give good idea appearance 
cluster tail spikelet green also rather rough touch 
notice two point shall see reason presently 
green leave greyish tint broad many grass leaf 
cut make hay leaf rather stiff hard 
timothy grows good thick clump make spread sward 
moist weather suit best though stand dry summer fairly well 
late grass 
grass field full flower today ears timothy see floweringtime july 
one way valuable grass hay heavy hay always sell weight 
hand timothy hay rather hard 
grass something like timothy yet different several way 
meadow foxtail 
ear form cluster spikelet shape ear timothy like round tail slightly point 
ear timothy green beautiful silvery grey 
timothy rough ear meadow foxtail soft silky touch 
silkiness silvery grey colour give ear soft hair call awn grows spikelet 
leaf broad juicy many 
meadow foxtail unlike timothy early grass may find flower april 
early grass always valuable farmer want herbage sheep cattle long winter 
foxtail moreover spread grass 
stem prostrate stand upright creep along ground 
prostrate stem fresh root grow produce fresh plant 
thus meadow foxtail make good sward 
another useful grass cocksfoot 
culm four five thick cluster spikelets grow small stalk 
cluster grow culm way remind u claw fowl reason name 
cocksfoot tall quick growing plant stem flower feel rough hard 
bluegreen leave juicy 
root go deep soil grass resists drought well 
must notice sweet vernal grass though much field grass dry give much sweet scent smell near hayfield 
chew stalk notice scent animal like pleasant flavour give hay 
though early grass also last till late autumn 
spikelet make cluster tail end stalk grow closely together timothy meadow foxtail 
look tufted hair grass 
pretty perhaps one prettiest grass see farmer look upon weed 
large spread head flower spikelet grow stem become gradually small towards top stalk 
flower purple shin silvery light upon 
grows thick clump tussock cattle care leaf
