three decades ago in a world as dangerous as todays americans of all stripes came together to advance the cause of freedom 
they had witnessed the wreckage of inexperienced good intentions at the highest levels of government the folly of an amateur foreign policy 
and so in defiance of a worldwide marxist advance 
they announced a goal as enduring as the vision of isaiah to proclaim liberty to the captives and summed up americas strategy for achieving that end in a timeless slogan peace through strength — an enduring peace based on freedom and the will to defend it 
that goal still requires the unity of americans beyond differences of party and conflicts of personality 
the rancor of past years must now give way to a common goal of security for our country and safety for our people 
for that we are prayerfully grateful and salute all who have played a role in defending our homeland 
we pledge to continue their vigilance and to assure they have the authority and resources they need to protect the nation 
all americans should affirm that our first obligation is the security of our country 
to all those who defend it we owe our full support and gratitude 
the waging of war — and the achieving of peace — should never be micromanaged in a party platform or on the floor of the senate and house of representatives for that matter 
in dealing with present conflicts and future crises our next president must preserve all options 
it would be presumptuous to specify them in advance and foolhardy to rule out any action deemed necessary for our security 
we acknowledge and appreciate the significant contributions of all of americas first responders who keep us safe and secure and who are ever ready to come to our aid 
the security of our country is now everyones responsibility from the department of homeland security to state and local first responders private businesses and individual families 
the fact that eighty percent of our critical infrastructure is in private hands highlights the need for publicprivate partnerships to safeguard it especially in the energy industry 
along with unrelenting vigilance to prevent bioterrorism and other wmdrelated attacks we must regularly exercise our ability to quickly respond if one were to occur 
we must continue to remove barriers to cooperation and information sharing 
modernized services must be made universally available and be adequately funded 
we must be able to thwart cyber attacks that could cripple our economy monitor terrorist activities while respecting americans civil liberties and protect against military and industrial espionage and sabotage 
all this requires experienced leadership 
they highlighted the failure of national policy to recognize and respond to the growth of a global terror network 
they should have put an end to the democrats naive thinking that international terrorists could be dealt with within the normal criminal justice system but that misconception persists 
the gravest threat we face — nuclear terrorism — demands a comprehensive strategy for reducing the worlds nuclear stockpiles and preventing proliferation 
the us should lead that effort by reducing the size of our nuclear arsenal to the lowest number consistent with our security requirements and 
working with other nuclear powers to do the same 
in cooperation with other nations 
we should end the production of weaponsgrade fissile material improve our collective ability to interdict the spread of weapons of mass destruction and related materials and ensure the highest possible security standards for existing nuclear materials wherever they may be located 
we must develop and deploy both national and theater missile defenses to protect the american homeland our people our armed forces abroad and our allies 
effective layered missile defenses are critical to guard against the unpredictable actions of rogue regimes and outlaw states reduce the possibility of strategic blackmail and avoid the disastrous consequences of an accidental or unauthorized launch by a foreign power 
intelligence is americas first line of defense 
we must increase the ranks and resources of our human intelligence capabilities integrate technical and human sources and get that information more quickly to the warfighter and the policy maker 
the multijurisdictional arrangements that now prevail on capitol hill should be replaced by a single joint committee on intelligence 
bioterrorism and cyber terrorism once the stuff of science fiction films are immediate threats to our nations health and safety 
our food and water distribution systems require special vigilance 
by the same token a wellplaced cyberattack could cripple our economy 
shut down our energy and transportation systems wreck our health care delivery systems 
and put millions of lives at risk 
although our country has thwarted new terrorist attacks since those threats do persist 
that is why our reform of the foreign intelligence surveillance act was so vital and why the democrats opposition to it was so wrong 
immigration policy is a national security issue for which we have one test does it serve the national interest 
by that standard republicans know america can have a strong immigration system without sacrificing the rule of law 
border security is essential to national security 
in an age of terrorism drug cartels and criminal gangs allowing millions of unidentified persons to enter and remain in this country poses grave risks to the sovereignty of the united states and the security of its people 
we simply must be able to track who is entering and leaving our country 
our determination to uphold the rule of law begins with more effective enforcement 
giving our agents the tools and resources they need to protect our sovereignty completing the border fence quickly and securing the borders and employing complementary strategies to secure our ports of entry 
experience shows that enforcement of existing laws is effective in reducing and reversing illegal immigration 
our commitment to the rule of law means smarter enforcement at the workplace against illegal workers and lawbreaking employers alike along with those who practice identity theft and traffic in fraudulent documents 
as long as jobs are available in the united states economic incentives to enter illegally will persist 
but we must empower employers so they can know with confidence that those they hire are permitted to work 
that means that the everify system—which is an internetbased system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees—must be reauthorized 
a phasedin requirement that employers use the everify system must be enacted 
the rule of law means guaranteeing to law enforcement the tools and coordination to deport criminal aliens without delay — and correcting court decisions that have made deportation so difficult 
it means enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas rather than letting millions flout the generosity that gave them temporary entry 
it means imposing maximum penalties on those who smuggle illegal aliens into the us both for their lawbreaking and for their cruel exploitation 
it means requiring cooperation among federal state and local law enforcement and real consequences including the denial of federal funds for selfdescribed sanctuary cities which stand in open defiance of the federal and state statutes that expressly prohibit such sanctuary policies and which endanger the lives of us citizens 
it does not mean drivers licenses for illegal aliens nor does it mean that states should be allowed to flout the federal law barring them from giving instate tuition rates to illegal aliens nor does it mean that illegal aliens should receive social security benefits or other public benefits except as provided by federal law 
we oppose amnesty 
the rule of law suffers if government policies encourage or reward illegal activity 
the american peoples rejection of en masse legalizations is especially appropriate given the federal government ’ s past failures to enforce the law 
todays immigrants are walking in the steps of most other americans ancestors seeking the american dream and contributing culturally and economically to our nation 
we celebrate the industry and love of liberty of these fellow americans 
both government and the private sector must do more to foster legally present immigrants integration into american life to advance respect for the rule of law and a common american identity 
it is a national disgrace that the first experience most new americans have is with a dysfunctional immigration bureaucracy defined by delay and confusion we will no longer tolerate those failures 
in our multiethnic nation everyone — immigrants and nativeborn alike — must embrace our core values of liberty equality meritocracy and respect for human dignity and the rights of women 
one sign of our unity is our english language 
for newcomers it has always been the fastest route to prosperity in america 
we support english as the official language in our nation while welcoming the ethnic diversity in the united states and the territories including language 
immigrants should be encouraged to learn english 
english is the accepted language of business commerce and legal proceedings and it is essential as a unifying cultural force 
it is also important as part of cultural integration that our schools provide better education in us history and civics for all children thereby fostering a commitment to our national motto e pluribus unum 
we are grateful to the thousands of new immigrants many of them not yet citizens who are serving in the armed forces 
their patriotism is inspiring it should remind the institutions of civil society of the need to embrace newcomers assist their journey to full citizenship and help their communities avoid patterns of isolation 
our country continues to accept refugees from troubled lands all over the world 
in some cases these are people who stood with america in dangerous times and they have first call on our hospitality 
we oppose however the granting of refugee status on the basis of lifestyle or other nonpolitical factors 
republican leadership from the presidency to the congress has given america the bestmanned besttrained bestequipped and bestled military in the world 
that is a radical change from the late s when national defense was neglected and underfunded by the clinton administration 
our armed forces today are modern agile and adaptable to the unpredictable range of challenges in the years ahead 
we pledge to keep them that way 
the men and women who wear our countrys uniform — whether on active duty or in the reserves or national guard — are the most important assets in our military arsenal 
they and their families must have the pay health care housing education and overall support they need 
we must significantly increase the size of our armed forces 
crucial to that goal will be retention of combat veterans 
injured military personnel deserve the best medical care our country has to offer 
the special circumstances of the conflict in iraq have resulted in an unprecedented incidence of traumatic brain injury which calls for a new commitment of resources and personnel for its care and treatment 
we must make military medicine the gold standard for advances in prosthetics and the treatment of trauma and eye injuries 
we must always remember those who have given the ultimate sacrifice their families must be assured meaningful financial assistance 
it is the solemn duty we owe and honor we give to those who bravely don the uniform of freedom 
we pledge to maintain the strength of the national guard and reserves and to ensure they receive pay benefits and resources befitting their service 
their historic role as citizensoldiers is a proud tradition linking every community with the cause of national security 
we affirm service members legal right to return to their civilian jobs whether in government or in the private sector when their active duty is completed and we call for greater transition assistance from employers across the nation to smooth their return to the work force 
the allvolunteer force has been a success 
we oppose reinstituting the draft whether directly or through compulsory national service 
we support the advancement of women in the military and their exemption from ground combat units 
military priorities and mission must determine personnel policies 
esprit and cohesion are necessary for military effectiveness and success on the battlefield 
to protect our servicemen and women and ensure that americas armed forces remain the best in the world we affirm the timelessness of those values the benefits of traditional military culture and the incompatibility of homosexuality with military service 
to military personnel who have served honorably and then retire or leave active duty we owe a smooth transition to civilian life 
funding for the programs that assist them should be sufficient timely and predictable and never be subject to political gamesmanship 
returning veterans must have access to education benefits job training and a wide variety of employment options 
we want to build on the bipartisan expansion of the gi bill by encouraging private colleges to bridge the gap between gi bill education benefits and tuition costs 
we will strongly enforce the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act so that returning veterans can promptly return to their former jobs 
our existing veteran preference regulations must lead to real action not hollow promises 
we encourage private businesses to expand their outreach to the veterans community especially disabled veterans 
we will hold the va accountable for tangible results and steady improvement of its services 
the va must become more responsive and more efficient by eliminating its disability backlog and reducing waiting times for treatment 
to ensure that the va provides veterans with world class medical care both at its own facilities and through partnerships with community providers we must recruit the next generation of highly qualified medical professionals 
where distance or crowding is an obstacle to traditional va facilitybased care our veterans should be provided access to qualified outofnetwork providers 
we call for greater attention by the va to the special health care needs of women veterans who will comprise an even larger percentage of va patients in the future 
the vas current disability compensation formulas need to be restructured and modernized 
those who have borne the burden of war must have access to training rehabilitation and education 
their families and caregivers deserve our concern and support 
we pledge special attention to combat stress injuries 
there must be adequate counseling when veterans return home — for them and their families 
they should have ongoing professional care whether in a va facility or closer to home so that the natural and usually temporary responses to the horrors of war do not become permanent conditions 
we recognize the need for more mental health professionals who can give the highest quality treatment to our veterans 
we applaud the nonprofit organizations which assist veterans and their families materially and in other ways 
they represent the best of the american spirit and merit our support 
the militarys partners are the men and women who work in the defense industry and civilian sector supplying the armed forces with weapons and equipment vital to the success of their mission 
to ensure that our troops receive the best material at the best value we must reform the defense budgeting and acquisition process to control costs and ensure vigorous and fair competition 
we will not allow congressional pork to take the place of sound sustained investment in the nations security 
the republican vision of peace through strength requires a sustained international effort which complements our military activities to develop and maintain alliances and relationships that will lead to greater peace and stability 
the international promotion of human rights reflects our heritage our values and our national interest 
societies that enjoy political and economic freedom and the rule of law are not given to aggression or fanaticism 
they become our natural allies 
republican leadership has made religious liberty a central element of us foreign policy 
asserting religious freedom should be a priority in all americas international dealings 
we salute the work of the us commission on international religious freedom and urge special training in religious liberty issues for all us diplomatic personnel 
to be successful international leaders we must uphold international law including the laws of war and update them when necessary 
our moral standing requires that we respect what are essentially american principles of justice 
in any war of ideas our values will triumph 
advancing americas values should be the core mission of every part of the federal government including the department of state 
americas diplomatic establishment must energetically represent our countrys agenda to the world 
we propose a thorough reform of its structure to ensure that promotions and appointments are based on performance in supporting the nations agenda 
our diplomats must be the best our country has to offer and america ’ s diplomatic abilities must be an integral part of americas national security system 
throughout the cold war our international broadcasting of free and impartial information promoted american values to combat tyranny 
it still does through radio free europeradio liberty and radiotv marti and it remains an important instrument in promoting a modernizing alternative to the culture of radical terror 
getting americas message out to the world is a critical element in the struggle against extremism and our government must wage a much more effective battle in the war of ideas 
generations after the end of slavery in america new forms of bondage have emerged to exploit men women and children 
we salute those across the political spectrum who have come together to end the commerce in our fellow human beings 
we advocate the establishment of an interagency task force on human trafficking reporting directly to the president 
and call for increased diplomatic efforts with foreign governments that have been negligent toward this evil 
the principle underlying our megans law — publicizing the identities of known offenders — should be extended to international travel in order to protect innocent children everywhere 
the united states participates in various inter national organizations which can at times serve the cause of peace and prosperity but those organizations must never serve as a substitute for principled american leadership 
nor should our participation in them prevent our joining with other democracies to protect our vital national interests 
at the united nations our country will pay a fair but not disproportionate share of dues but we will never support a unimposed tax 
the un must reform its scandalridden and corrupt management and become more accountable and transparent in its operations and expenses 
as a matter of us sovereignty american forces must remain under american command 
discrimination against israel at the un is unacceptable 
we welcome israels membership in the western european and others group at the un headquarters and demand its full acceptance and participation at all un venues 
we likewise oppose the ideological campaign against vatican participation in un conferences and other activities 
because the un has no mandate to promote radical social engineering any effort to address global social problems must respect the fundamental institutions of marriage and family 
we assert the rights of families in all international programs and will not fund organizations involved in abortion 
we strongly support the longheld policy of the republican party known as the mexico city policy which prohibits federal monies from being given to nongovernmental organizations that provide abortions or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries 
we reject any treaty or agreement that would violate those values 
that includes the un convention on womens rights signed in the last months of the carter administration and the un convention on the rights of the child 
for several reasons particularly our concern for us sovereignty 
and americas longterm energy needs 
we have deep reservations about the regulatory legal and tax regimes inherent in the law of the sea treaty 
to shield the members of our armed forces and others in service to america from ideological prosecutions the republican party does not accept the jurisdiction of the international criminal court over americans 
we support the american servicemembers protection act to shield us personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet global security requirements 
americans are the most generous people in the world 
no nation spends more in combined public and private efforts to combat disease and poverty around the world and no nation works harder to ensure the continued vitality of the global economy 
our reasons for doing so are both moral and practical for a world where half of the human race lives on a few dollars a day is neither just nor stable 
including the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development is part and parcel of the republican approach to world trade through open markets and fair competition 
it must also be a top priority of our foreign policy 
decades of massive aid have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries where it has often propped up failed policies and corrupt rulers 
we will target foreign assistance to highimpact goals 
fostering the rule of law through democratic government 
emphasizing literacy and learning and concentrating on the foundations for economic development — clean water agricultural improvement and microcredit funding for small enterprises 
maternal and child health especially safer childbirthing and nutrition must be priorities especially in countries affected by epidemics of hivaids malaria and tuberculosis 
further we call for the development of a strategy for foreign assistance that serves our national interest 
specifically we call for a review and improvement of the foreign assistance act of oriented toward alignment of foreign assistance policies operations budgets and statutory authorities development of a consensus on what needs to be done to strengthen the nonmilitary tools to further our national security goals greater attention to core development programs — education child survival and agricultural development and greater accountability by recipient countries so as to ensure against malfeasance selfdealing and corruption and to ensure continued assistance is conditioned on performance 
faith and family culture and commerce are enduring bonds among all the peoples of the americas 
republicans envision a western hemisphere of sovereign nations with secure borders working together to advance liberty and mutuallybeneficial trade based on sound and proven free enterprise principles 
our relations with our immediate neighbors canada and mexico are grounded on our shared values and common purpose as well as our steadily increasing trade 
we pledge to continue this close association and to advance mutually beneficial trade agreements throughout latin america promoting economic development and social stability there while opening markets to our goods and services 
our strong ties with canada and mexico should not lead to a north american union or a unified currency 
two factors distort this hemispheric progress 
one is narcoterrorism with its ability to destabilize societies and corrupt the political process 
in an era of porous borders the war on drugs and the war on terror have become a single enterprise 
we salute our allies in the fight against this evil especially the people of mexico and colombia who have set an example for their neighbors 
we support approval of the free trade agreement with colombia currently blocked by capitol hill democrats and their union boss supporters as an overdue gesture of solidarity for this courageous ally of the united states 
the other malignant element in hemispheric affairs is the anachronistic regime in havana a mummified relic from the age of totalitarianism and its buffoonish imitators 
we call on the nations of latin america and the caribbean to join us in laying the groundwork for a democratic cuba 
looking to the inevitable day of liberation we support restrictions on trade with and travel to cuba as a measure of solidarity with the political prisoners and all the oppressed cuban people 
we call for a dedicated platform for transmission of radio and television marti into cuba and to prepare for the day when cuba is free we support the work of the commission for assistance to a free cuba 
we affirm the principles of the cuban adjustment act of recognizing the rights of cubans fleeing communist tyranny and support efforts to admit more of them through a safe legal orderly process 
republicans have faced up to each of those challenges because in addition to humanitarian concerns the us has important security interests in the stability and progress of african nations 
the devastating toll of hivaids threatens to destabilize entire societies through large numbers of orphaned youths 
in response the us has become the unrivaled leader in fighting the diseases that are the scourge of much of the continent 
republicansponsored legislation has brought jobs and investment to subsaharan africa 
to continue that progress we advocate continued expansion of trade with african nations 
genocide must end 
the horrendous suffering of the people in the darfur region of sudan as well as less publicized human tragedies elsewhere calls for a far more energetic and determined response from africas elected leaders 
the united states stands ready to assist them with materiel transportation and humanitarian supplies 
we will continue america ’ s diplomatic efforts to secure a comprehensive and humane settlement for the people of the southern and western sudan 
the promise of democracy and freedom in africa is diminished by the government of zimbabwe which has seized lands without compensation debased the currency murdered and tortured its people and so intimidated voters that free and fair elections are impossible 
we support sanctions against this government free elections and the restoration of civil government in zimbabwe 
the us is a pacific nation and our historic ties to asia will grow stronger in the years ahead 
australia has stood shoulder to shoulder with us in every major conflict 
the ties between our peoples our economies and our governments are extraordinary 
we cherish our bonds with our freely associated states in the pacific islands 
our longstanding alliance with japan has been the foundation for peace and prosperity in asia and we look for japan to forge a leadership role in regional and global affairs 
another valued ally the republic of korea remains vigilant with us against the tyranny and international ambitions of the maniacal state on its border 
the us will not waver in its demand for the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of north korea ’ s nuclear weapons programs with a full accounting of its proliferation activities 
we look toward the restoration of human rights to the suffering people of north korea and the fulfilment of the wish of the korean people to be one in peace and freedom 
we welcome america ’ s new relationship with india including the usindia civil nuclear accord 
our common security concerns and shared commitment to political freedom and representative government can be the foundation for an enduring partnership 
we must expand our ties with the government and the people of pakistan 
we support their efforts to improve democratic governance and strengthen civil society and we appreciate the difficult but essential role pakistan plays in the fight against terror 
our policy toward taiwan a sound democracy and economic model for mainland china must continue to be based upon the provisions of the taiwan relations act 
we oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the taiwan straits on the principle that all issues regarding the islands future must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and be agreeable to the people of taiwan 
if china were to violate these principles the us in accord with the taiwan relations act will help taiwan defend itself 
as a loyal friend of america the democracy of taiwan has merited our strong support including the timely sale of defensive arms and full participation in the world health organization and other multilateral institutions 
we will welcome the emergence of a peaceful and prosperous china and we will welcome even more the development of a democratic china 
its rulers have already discovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth the next lesson is that political and religious freedom leads to national greatness 
that is not likely to be learned while the government in beijing pursues advanced military capabilities without any apparent need imposes a onechild policy on its people suppresses basic human rights in tibet and elsewhere and erodes democracy in hong kong 
china must honor its obligations regarding free speech and a free press as announced prior to the olympics 
our bilateral trade with china has created export opportunities for american farmers and workers while both the requirements of the world trade organization and the realities of the marketplace have increased openness and the rule of law in china 
we must yet ensure that china fulfils its wto obligations especially those related to protecting intellectual property rights elimination of subsidies and repeal of import restrictions chinas full integration into the global economy requires that it adopt a flexible monetary exchange rate and allow free movement of capital 
chinas economic growth brings with it the responsibility for environmental improvement both for its own people and for the world community 
our relations with vietnam have improved but two grave matters remain 
the first is the need for unceasing efforts to obtain an accounting for and repatriation of the remains of americans who gave their lives in the cause of freedom 
the second is continued repression of human rights and religious freedom and the retribution by the government of vietnam against its ethnic minorities and others who assisted us forces there 
we owe them a debt of honor and will do all we can to relieve their suffering 
we urge all the nations of east asia to join the worldwide effort to restore the suffering people of burma to the democratic family of nations 
the military dictatorship in burma is among the worst on the planet 
its savagery demands a strong response from the world community including economic and financial sanctions and isolation of the illegitimate regime 
our countrys ties to the peoples of europe are based on shared culture and values common interests and goals 
we particularly appreciate our close friendship with the united kingdom a relationship that has led the forces of freedom for generations 
the enduring truth — that americas security is inseparable from europes — was reaffirmed by our european allies after september 
nato the most successful military alliance in history has been greatly strengthened by the addition of new members in central and eastern europe 
we believe the door to nato membership should remain open to all democratic nations who share our values and meet the requirements for nato membership 
we strongly support natoendorsed efforts to deploy missile defenses to protect our european allies from the threat of iranian missiles and we appreciate the willingness of the governments of poland and the czech republic to host these needed defensive systems 
we condemn the russian federations attempts to intimidate states formerly under soviet domination in order to prevent their deploying missile defenses 
the decision on this question is for each sovereign nation to decide 
we support the ongoing reconciliation efforts in cyprus and northern ireland including the appointment of a us special envoy for northern ireland 
we condemn the escalation of antisemitic violence arson and desecration in europe and other areas of the world 
americans and the russian people have common imperatives ending terrorism combating nuclear proliferation promoting bilateral trade and more 
but matters of serious concern remain particularly the russian governments treatment of the press opposition parties and institutions of civil society 
it continues its aggressive confrontations with its neighbors from economic intimidation to outright warfare and has aligned with dangerous antidemocratic forces in the middle east 
as a condition for its continued acceptance in world organizations russia must respect the independence and territorial integrity of all the nations of the former soviet union beginning with the republic of georgia and move toward a free and democratic society 
the momentum of change in the middle east has been in the right direction 
from morocco to the gulf states the overall trend has been toward cooperation and social and economic development especially with regard to the rights of women 
we acknowledge the substantial assistance the us has received from most governments in the region in the war on terror 
those countries that have made peace with israel whether officially or in fact deserve our appreciation and assistance 
we urge the continued isolation of groups like hamas and hezbollah because they do not meet the standards of the international community 
we call for the restoration of lebanons independence and sovereignty and the full implementation of all un resolutions concerning that country 
the struggle in which we are engaged is ideological not ethnic or religious 
the extremists we face are abusers of faith not its champions 
we appreciate the loyalty of all americans whose family roots lie in the middle east and we gratefully acknowledge the contributions of american arabs and muslims especially those in the armed forces and the intelligence community 
israel is a vigorous democracy unique in the middle east 
we reaffirm americas commitment to israels security and will ensure that israel maintains a qualitative edge in military technology over any potential adversaries israel must have secure defensible borders and we support its right to exist as a jewish state able to defend itself against homicide bombings rocket and mortar fire and other attacks against its people 
we support the vision of two democratic states living in peace and security israel with jerusalem as its capital and palestine 
for that to become a reality the palestinian people must support leaders who reject terror embrace the institutions and ethos of democracy and respect the rule of law 
we call on arab governments throughout the region to help advance that goal 
we support jerusalem as the undivided capital of israel and moving the american embassy to that undivided capital of israel 
the us seeks a comprehensive and lasting peace in the middle east negotiated between the parties themselves without the imposition of an artificial timetable and without the demand that israel deal with entities which continue to pledge her destruction 
at the heart of any peace process must be a mutual commitment to resolve all issues through negotiation 
part of that process must be a just fair and realistic framework for dealing with the palestinian refugee issue 
like all other elements in a meaningful agreement this matter can be settled only on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect todays realities as well as tomorrows hopes 
a stable unified and democratic iraqi nation is within reach 
our success in iraq will deny al qaeda a safe haven limit iranian influence in the middle east strengthen moderate forces there and give us a strategic ally in the struggle against extremism 
to those who have sacrificed so much we owe the commitment that american forces will leave that country in victory and with honor 
that outcome is too critical to our own national security to be jeopardized by artificial or politically inspired timetables that neither reflect conditions on the ground nor respect the essential advice of our military commanders 
as the people of iraq assume their rightful place in the ranks of free and open societies we offer them a continuing partnership 
in the seven years since us troops helped topple the taliban there has been great progress — but much remains to be done 
we must prevail in afghanistan to prevent the reemergence of the taliban or an al qaeda sanctuary in that country 
a nationwide counterinsurgency strategy led by a unified commander is an essential prerequisite to success 
additional forces are also necessary both from nato countries and through a doubling in size of the afghan army 
the international community must work with the afghan government to better address the problems of illegal drugs governance and corruption 
we flatly reject the democratic party ’ s idea that america can succeed in afghanistan only by failure in iraq 
we express our respect for the people of iran who seek peace and aspire to freedom 
their current regime aggressive and repressive is unworthy of them 
the iranian people many of whom risk persecution to speak out for democracy have a right to choose their own government 
as a rogue state iran ’ s leadership supports terror threatens its neighbors and provides weapons that are killing our troops in iraq 
we affirm in the plainest words we can use that the us government in solidarity with the international community will not allow the current regime in tehran to develop nuclear weapons 
we call for a significant increase in political economic and diplomatic pressure to persuade irans rulers to halt their drive for a nuclear weapons capability and we support tighter sanctions against iran and the companies with business operations in or with iran 
we oppose entering into a presidentiallevel unconditional dialogue with the regime in iran until it takes steps to improve its behavior particularly with respect to support of terrorism and suspension of its efforts to enrich uranium 
at the same time the us must retain all options in dealing with a situation that gravely threatens our security our interests and the safety of our friends 
the american people believe washington is broken and for good reason 
shortterm politics overshadow the longterm interests of the nation 
our national legislature uses a budget process devised long before the internet and seems unable to deal in realistic ways with the most pressing problems of families businesses and communities 
members of congress have been indicted for violating the public trust 
public disgust with washington is entirely warranted 
republicans will uphold and defend our partys core principles 
constrain the federal government to its legitimate constitutional functions 
let it empower people while limiting its reach into their lives 
spend only what is necessary and tax only to raise revenue for essential government functions 
unleash the power of enterprise innovation civic energy and the american spirit — and never pretend that government is a substitute for family or community 
the other party wants more government control over peoples lives and earnings republicans do not 
the other party wants to continue pork barrel politics we are disgusted by it no matter who practices it 
the other party wants to ignore fiscal problems while squandering billions on ineffective programs we are determined to end that waste 
the entrenched culture of official washington — an intrusive taxandspend liberalism — remains a formidable foe but we will confront and ultimately defeat it 
the federal government collects trillion a year from american families and businesses 
thats billion a day 
even worse it spends over trillion a year billion a day 
why largely because those who created this bloated government will not admit a single mistake or abolish a single program 
here are some staggering examples of the overall problem recent audits show that of all federal programs are ineffective or incapable of demonstrating results separate programs administered by different agencies provide education or care to children under the age of nine separate agencies administer different programs for job training • separate programs each with its own overhead provide housing assistance to the elderly 
with so many redundant inefficient and ineffective federal programs it is no wonder that the american people have so little confidence in washington to act effectively when federal action is really needed 
for more than three decades — since enactment of the budget act of by a democratcontrolled congress — the federal government has operated within a rigged system notable for its lack of transparency 
the earlier approach — annual passage of the appropriation bills amended and voted up or down with the numbers there for all to see — had its flaws and generated much red ink 
but its replacement the current budget process only worsened the money flow and came to rely on monstrous omnibus spending bills 
the results are adverse to all seeking to limit governments growth 
for example the budget process assumes every spending project will be on the books forever even if the law says the spending will expire — but it assumes tax relief will be temporary it treats welldeserved tax cuts as a kind of spending so that letting americans keep more of their earnings is considered the same as more spending on pork projects it fails to recognize the positive impact that lowering tax rates has on economic growth in its deceptive and irresponsible accounting an increase in a programs funding is actually a decrease if it is less than the rate of inflation once a budget is produced under that sys tem the budget law itself limits the time congress can consider it before voting 
moreover the budgets review process is a sham 
of the trillion spent annually only onethird is reviewed each year during the budget and appropriations process the remaining trillion automatically goes to interest on the national debt or entitlements 
and because the budget process assumes an automatic increase in spending the debate on the remaining onethird is only over how much more spending to approve 
finally while government requires corporations to budget for future pension and health care costs our government ignores those requirements 
no family or private sector business could keep its books the way washington keeps ours 
republicans will attack wasteful washington spending immediately 
current procedures should be replaced with simplicity and transparency 
for example we favor adoption of the balanced budget amendment to require a balanced federal budget except in time of war 
earmarking must stop 
to eliminate wasteful projects and payoffs to special interests we will impose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system and reform the appropriations process through full transparency 
tax dollars must be distributed on the basis of clear national priorities not a politicians seniority or party position 
government waste must be taken off autopilot 
we call for a oneyear pause in nondefense nonveterans discretionary spend ing to force a critical costbenefit review of all current programs 
we call for a constitutionally sound presidential lineitem veto 
if billions are worth spending they should be spent in the light of day 
we will insist that before either the house or senate considers a spending bill every item in it should be presented in advance to the taxpayers on the internet 
because the problem is too much spending not too few taxes we support a supermajority requirement in both the house and senate to guard against tax hikes 
new authorizations should be offset by reducing another program and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization 
congressional ethics rules governing special interests should apply across the board without the special exemptions now granted to favored institutions 
we support the government shutdown protection act to ensure the continuance of essential federal functions when advocates of pork threaten to shut down the government unless their wasteful spending is accepted 
we will insist that the budget reasonably plan for the longterm costs of pension and health care programs and urge the conversion of such programs to defined contribution programs 
the long term solution for many of washingtons problems is structural 
congress must respect the limits imposed upon it by the tenth amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people 
we look to the model of republican welfare reform which since its enactment in has accomplished a major transfer of resources and responsibility from the federal government back to the states — with an accompanying improvement in the program itself 
applying that approach to other programs will steer congress back into line with the constitution reversing both its intrusion into state matters and its neglect of its central duties 
to aid in the fulfillment of those duties we propose a national sunset commission to review all federal programs and recommend which of them should be terminated due to redundancy waste or intrusion into the american family 
the congress would then be required by law to schedule one yea or nay vote on the entire sunset list with no amendments 
additionally as important as returning power to the states is returning power to the people 
as the declaration of independence states our rights are endowed to us by our creator and are inalienable rights to life liberty and property 
government does not confer these rights but is instituted by men to protect the rights that man already possesses 
the republican party strongly affirms these rights and demands that government respect them 
congress has a fundamental duty to conduct meaningful oversight on the effectiveness of government programs not use every hearing as an opportunity for political grandstanding 
to that end • we urge every congressional committee to reserve at least one week every month to conduct oversight of the nearly separate grant and loan programs of the federal government 
to prevent conflicts of interest a truth in testimony mandate should require all committee witnesses to detail the amount of federal funding they and their employer currently receive and in the case of associations how much federal money their members would receive from the proposed legislation 
because official washington does not even know how much land it owns we call for a national audit of all federallyowned properties as a first step toward returning unnecessary properties to the american people or to state and local government for public use 
modern management of the federal government is long overdue 
the expected retirement over the next ten years of more than percent of the federal workforce and percent of its managers presents a rare opportunity a chance to gradually shrink the size of government while using technology to increase its effectiveness and reshape the way agencies do business 
each agency must be able to pass a financial audit and set annual targets for improving efficiency with fewer resources 
civil service managers should be given incentives for more effective leadership including protection against the current guiltyuntilproveninnocent grievance procedures which disgruntled employees use against them to thwart reform 
due process can not excuse bad behavior 
we will provide internet transparency in all federal contracting as a necessary step in combating cost overruns 
we will draw on the expertise of todays successful managers and entrepreneurs in the private sector like the dollarayear businesspeople who answered their countrys call during the second world war to build realworld competence and accountability into government procurement and operations 
americans hit by disaster must never again feel abandoned by their government 
the katrina disaster taught a painful lesson the federal governments system for responding to a natural calamity needs a radical overhaul 
we recognize the need for a natural disaster insurance policy 
state and local cooperation is crucial as are private relief efforts but washington must take the lead in forging a partnership with americas best run businesses to ensure that femas emergency operations centers run as well as any fortune company 
we must make it easier for both businesses and nonprofits to act as forcemultipliers in relief situations 
we believe it is critical to support those impacted by natural disasters and to complete the rebuilding of devastated areas including the gulf coast 
the american people can have safer roads and bridges better airports and more efficient harbors as long as we straighten out the governments spending priorities 
the politics of pork distorts the allocation of resources for modernizing the nations infrastructure 
that can leave entire communities vulnerable to natural disasters and deprive others of the improvements necessary for economic growth and job creation 
we pledge a businesslike costeffective approach for infrastructure spending always mindful of the special needs of both rural and urban communities 
we support a level of investment in the nations transportation system that will promote a healthy economy sustain jobs and keep america globally competitive 
we need to improve the systems performance and capacity to deal with congestion move a massive amount of freight reduce traffic fatalities and ensure mobility across both rural and urban areas 
we urgently need to preserve the highway transit and air facilities built over the last century so they can serve generations to come 
at the same time we are committed to minimizing transportations impact on climate change our local environments and the nations energy use 
careful reforms of environmental reviews and the permitting process should speed projects to completion 
safeguarding our transportation infrastructure is critical to our homeland security 
an integrated flexible system — developed and sustained in partnership between state and local governments and the federal government — must also share responsibilities with the private sector 
we call for more prudent stewardship of the nations highway trust fund to restore the programs purchasing power and ensure that it will meet the changing needs of a mobile nation 
the job of modernizing social security medicare and medicaid calls for bipartisanship not political posturing 
through the last four presidential terms we have sought that cooperation but it has not been forthcoming 
the public demands constructive action and we will provide it 
we are committed to putting social security on a sound fiscal basis 
our society faces a profound demographic shift over the next twentyfive years from todays ratio of workers for every retiree to only workers by 
under the current system younger workers will not be able to depend on social security as part of their retirement plan 
we believe the solution should give workers control over and a fair return on their contributions 
no changes in the system should adversely affect any current or nearretiree 
comprehensive reform should include the opportunity to freely choose to create your own personal investment accounts which are distinct from and supplemental to the overall social security system 
as discussed in the health care section of this document we commit to revive medicare by rewarding quality care promoting competition eliminating waste fraud and abuse and giving patients and providers control over treatment options 
we envision a new medicaid partnership with the states improving public health through flexibility and innovation 
judicial activism is a grave threat to the rule of law because unaccountable federal judges are usurping democracy ignoring the constitution and its separation of powers and imposing their personal opinions upon the public 
this must stop 
we condemn the supreme courts disregard of homeowners property rights in its kelo decision and deplore the courts arbitrary extension of americans habeas corpus rights to enemy combatants held abroad 
we object to the courts unwarranted interference in the administration of the death penalty in this country for the benefit of savage criminals whose guilt is not at issue 
we lament that judges have denied the people their right to set abortion policies in the states and are undermining traditional marriage laws from coast to coast 
we are astounded that four justices of the supreme court believe that individual americans have no individual right to bear arms to protect themselves and their families 
republicans will insist on the appointment of constitutionalist judges men and women who will not distort our founding documents to deny the peoples right to selfgovernment sanction federal powers that violate our liberties or inject foreign law into american jurisprudence 
we oppose stealth nominations to the federal bench and especially to the supreme court whose lack of a clear and distinguished record leaves doubt about their respect for the constitution or their intellectual fortitude 
nominees must have a record of fidelity to the us constitution and the rule of law 
we reject the democrats view that judicial nominees should guarantee particular results even before the case is filed 
judges should not be politicians 
jurists nominated by a republican president will be thoughtful and openminded always prepared to view past error in light of stare decisis including judicial fiats that disenfranchised the american people 
no qualified person should be denied the opportunity to serve on the federal bench due to race ethnicity religion or sex 
in affirming article vi of the constitution — that no religious test shall ever be required for any office — we insist that the senate should never inquire into a nominees religious convictions and we condemn the opposition by some members of the democratic party to recent judicial nominees because of their ethnicity or religion 
many members of the armed services will find it difficult to participate in this years elections because of the governments reliance on outdated and inadequate voting notification and ballot delivery systems 
the mishandling and delaying of registration forms and absentee ballots disenfranchises thousands of our servicemen and servicewomen 
the commanderinchief the department of defense and state and local election officials must do more to protect the voting rights of those on the front lines of freedom 
that means using expedited mail delivery to bring ballots to and from our troops abroad including those serving in areas of conflict while completing work on an electronic ballot delivery system that will enable our military personnel to receive and cast their ballots in a secure and convenient manner 
we oppose attempts to distort the electoral process by wholesale restoration of the franchise to convicted felons by makeshift or hurried naturalization procedures or by discretionary ballotreading by election boards 
preventing voting fraud is a civil rights issue 
we support the right of states to require an official governmentissued photo identification for voting and call upon the department of justice to deploy its resources to prevent ballot tampering in the november elections 
we support efforts by state and local election officials to ensure integrity in the voting process and to prevent voter fraud and abuse particularly as it relates to voter registration and absentee ballots 
the rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box 
they include the freespeech right to devote one ’ s resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports 
we oppose any restrictions or conditions upon those activities that would discourage americans from exercising their constitutional right to enter the political fray or limit their commitment to their ideals 
the integrity of the census proportioning congressional representation among the states must be preserved 
the census should count every person legally abiding in the united states in an actual enumeration 
we urge all who are legally eligible to participate in the census count to do so at the same time we urge congress to specify — and to constitutionally justify — which census questions require a response 
we appreciate the extraordinary sacrifices the men and women of the territories are making to protect our freedom through their service in the us armed forces 
we welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by americans residing in guam the virgin islands american samoa the northern marianas and puerto rico 
we affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution with all the political rights and responsibilities it entails we recognize the valuable contributions made by the people of the united states virgin islands to the common welfare of the nation including national defense and their contributions to the federal treasury in the form of federal excise taxes paid on products produced in the territory 
we support the native american samoans efforts to protect their right to selfgovernment and to preserve their culture and landtenure system which fosters selfreliance and strong extendedfamily values 
we support increased local selfgovernment for the united states citizens of the virgin islands and closer cooperation between the local and federal governments to promote private sectorled development and selfsufficiency 
we recognize that guam is a strategically vital us territory an american fortress in the western pacific 
we affirm our support for the patriotic us citizens of guam and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands to achieve greater selfgovernment an improved federal territorial relationship new economic development strategies a strong health care system that meets their needs and continued political selfdetermination 
we support a review to determine the appropriate eligibility of territories as well as states for supplemental security income and other federal programs 
we support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine 
we recognize that congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for puerto rico to achieve a permanent nonterritorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement 
as long as puerto rico is not a state however the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the us government 
the nations capital is a special responsibility of the federal government 
yet some of the worst performing schools in the country are mere blocks from the department of education and some of the most crimeridden neighborhoods in the country are blocks from the department of justice 
washington should be made a model city 
two major republican initiatives — a firsttime dc homebuyers credit and a landmark school choice initiative — have pointed the way toward a civic resurgence and a third piece of gop legislation now guarantees young dc residents significant assistance in affording higher education 
because washingtons buildings and monuments may be top targets of terrorist groups the federal government must work closely with local officials to improve security without burdening local residents 
we call on the district of columbia city council to pass laws consistent with the supreme courts decision in the heller case 
we honor the contributions of the residents of the district of columbia especially those who are serving honorably or have served in our armed forces 
americas free economy has given our country the worlds highest standard of living and allows us to share our prosperity with the rest of humanity 
it is an engine of charity empowering everything from sabbath collection plate to great endowments 
it creates opportunity rewards selfreliance and hard work and unleashes productive energies that other societies can only imagine 
today our economy faces challenges due to high energy costs 
our task is to strengthen our economy and build a greater degree of security — in availability of jobs in accessibility of health care in portability of pensions and in affordability of energy 
that is an urgent task because economic freedom — and the prosperity it makes possible — are not ends in themselves 
they are means by which families and individuals can maintain their independence from government raise their children by their own values and build communities of selfreliant neighbors 
economic freedom expands the prosperity pie government can only divide it up 
that is why republicans advocate lower taxes reasonable regulation and smaller smarter government 
that agenda translates to more opportunity for more people 
it represents the economics of inclusion the path by which hopes become achievements 
it is the way we will reach our goal of enabling everyone to have a chance to own invest and build 
the most important distinction between republicans and the leadership of todays democratic party concerning taxes is not just that we believe you should keep more of what you earn 
thats true but there is a more fundamental distinction 
it concerns the purpose of taxation 
we believe government should tax only to raise money for its essential functions 
todays democratic party views the tax code as a tool for social engineering 
they use it to control our behavior steer our choices and change the way we live our lives 
the republican party will put a stop to both social engineering and corporate handouts by simplifying tax policy eliminating special deals and putting those saved dollars back into the taxpayers pockets 
sound tax policy alone may not ensure economic success but terrible tax policy does guarantee economic failure 
along with making the and tax cuts permanent so american families will not face a large tax hike republicans will advance tax policies to support american families promote savings and innovation and put us on a path to fundamental tax reform 
american families with children are the hardest hit during any economic downturn 
republicans will lower their tax burden by doubling the exemption for dependents 
new technology should not occasion more taxation 
we will permanently ban internet access taxes and stop all new cell phone taxes 
for the sake of family farms and small businesses we will continue our fight against the federal death tax 
the alternative minimum tax a stealth levy on the middleclass that unduly targets large families must be repealed 
republicans support tax credits for health care and medical expenses 
america ’ s producers can compete successfully in the international arena — as long as they have a level playing field 
todays tax code is tilted against them with one of the highest corporate tax rates of all developed countries 
that not only hurts american investors managers and the us balance of trade it also sends american jobs overseas 
we support a major reduction in the corporate tax rate so that american companies stay competitive with their foreign counterparts and american jobs can remain in this country 
we support a tax code that encourages personal savings 
high tax rates discourage thrift by penalizing the return on savings and should be replaced with incentives to save 
we support a plan to encourage employers to offer automatic enrollment in taxdeferred savings programs 
the current limits on taxfree savings accounts should be removed 
over the long run the mammoth irs tax code must be replaced with a system that is simple transparent and fair while maximizing economic growth and job creation 
as a transition we support giving all taxpayers the option of filing under current rules or under a tworate flat tax with generous deductions for families 
this gradual approach is the taxpayers best hope of overcoming the lobbyist legions that have thwarted past simplification efforts 
as a matter of principle we oppose retroactive taxation and we condemn attempts by judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse by ordering higher taxes 
because of the vital role of religious organizations charities and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering charity and patriotism they should not be subject to taxation 
in any fundamental restructuring of federal taxation to guard against the possibility of hypertaxation of the american people any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to simultaneous repeal of the sixteenth amendment which established the federal income tax 
the last thing americans need right now is tax hikes 
on the federal level republicans lowered taxes in and in order to encourage economic growth put more money in the pockets of every taxpayer and make the system fairer 
it worked 
if congress had then controlled its spending we could have done even more 
ever since those tax cuts were enacted the democratic party has been clear about its goals it wants to raise taxes by eliminating those republican tax reductions 
the impact on american families would be disastrous 
marginal tax rates would rise 
this is in addition to their proposal to target millions of taxpayers with even higher rates 
the marriage penalty would return for twoearner couples 
the child tax credit would fall to half its current value 
small businesses would lose their tax relief 
the federal death tax would be enormously increased 
investment income — the seed money for new jobs — would be eaten away by higher rates for dividend and capital gain income 
all that and more would amount to an annual tax hike upwards of billion — almost per taxpayer every year for a total of trillion in additional taxes over the next decade 
that is what todays democratic party calls tax fairness 
we call it an unconscionable assault on the paychecks and pocketbooks of every hardworking american household 
their promises to aim their tax hikes at families with high incomes is a smokescreen history shows that when democrats want more money they raise taxes on everyone 
we proudly call ourselves the party of small business because small businesses are where national prosperity begins 
small businesses such as main street retailers entrepreneurs independent contractors and direct sellers create most of the countrys new jobs and have been the primary means of economic advancement by women and minorities 
eight years ago when democrats controlled the executive branch small business faced a hostile regulatory agenda from oshas ergonomics standards and attempts to intrude into the homes of telecommuting employees to irs discrimination against independent contractors 
republicans turned back those threats along with much of the onerous taxation that limited the growth of small businesses 
we reduced their marginal tax rates quadrupled the limit on their expensing of investments and phased out the death tax on family owned small businesses and family farms 
we enacted health savings accounts to help small business owners secure health insurance for themselves and their employees 
all those gains are jeopardized if democrats gain unfettered power once again 
republicans will advance a multipronged plan to support small business and grow goodpaying jobs 
through the energy agenda laid out elsewhere in this platform we will attack the rise in energy costs that is making it so difficult for entrepreneurs to compete 
our tax reduction and tax simplification agenda will allow businesses to focus on producing and selling their products and services — not on paying taxes 
our plan to return control of health care to patients and providers will benefit small business employers and employees alike 
our determination to vigorously open foreign markets to american products is an opportunity for many small businesses to grow larger in the global economy 
our approach to regulation — basing it on sound science to achieve goals that are technically feasible — will protect against jobkilling intrusions into small businesses 
our commitment to legal reform means protecting small businesses from the effects of frivolous lawsuits 
using history as our guide we look to innovative entrepreneurs for the ingenuity and daring that can give us the next generation of technological progress 
the advances our country needs in everything from health care to energy to environmental protection are most likely to come from the men and women of small business 
american innovation has twin engines technology and small business employing over half the privatesector work force 
the synergy of our technology and small business drove a worldwide economic transformation of the last quartercentury 
to maintain our global leadership we need to encourage innovators by reforming and making permanent the research and development tax credit as part of the overall agenda outlined in this platform 
innovation is our future — in our approach to energy to education to health care and especially to government 
as a symbol of that commitment we share the vision of returning americans to the moon as a step toward a mission to mars 
in advancing our countrys space and aeronautics program nasa will remain one of the worlds most important pioneers in technology and from its explorations can come tremendous benefits for mankind 
to master the global economy our work force must be creative independent and able to adapt to rapid change 
that challenge calls for better education and training and new approaches to employeremployee relations 
it means investing in people not institutions 
the democrats approach to employment policy is a retreat to failed models of the past new regulatory burdens on employers that make it more difficult for businesses big and small to hire and keep employees 
that failed model empowers union bosses at the expense of their members trial lawyers at the expense of small businesses and government bureaucrats at the expense of employeremployee partnerships 
its goal is not to create jobs but to control the workplace and the work force 
republicans believe that the employeremployee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment and workplace flexibility 
the industrial revolution treated people like machines todays economy must treat them as individuals 
we recognize that work schedules should be more flexible when employers and employees are not negatively affected such as removing outdated distinctions between full time and part time clockpunching and overtime 
the federal government should set an example in that regard 
• the workplace must catch up with the way americans live now 
for increasing numbers of workers especially those with children the choice of working from home will be good for families profitable for business and energy efficient 
all workers should have portability in their pension plans and their health insurance giving them greater job mobility financial independence and security 
global competitiveness will increasingly require an entrepreneurial culture of cooperation and team work 
making the best talent part of our team is the rationale for the h b visa program which needs updating to reflect our need for more leaders in science and technology while we take the necessary steps to create more of them in our own school systems 
by complementing the us work force with needed specialists from abroad we can make sure american companies and their jobs remain here at home 
businesses and employees working together are best suited to addressing the challenges ahead 
empowering official washington and the trial bar as democrats prefer will only lead to more antagonistic relations 
government can play an important role in addressing economic dislocations by modernizing its retraining and unemployment assistance programs 
we must make these programs actually anticipate dislocations so that affected workers can get new skills quickly and return to the workforce 
we advocate a seamless approach to helping employees stay on the job and advance through education 
workers should be able to direct a portion of their unemployment insurance into a tax free lost earnings buffer account that could be used for retraining or relocation 
with financial incentives to return to work as soon as possible this approach will also require strengthening community colleges and making them more accessible through flexible training accounts 
we affirm both the right of individuals to voluntarily participate in labor organizations and bargain collectively and the right of states to enact rightto work laws 
but the nations labor laws to a large extent formed out of conflicts several generations ago should be modernized to make it easier for employers and employees to plan execute and profit together 
to protect workers from misuse of their funds we will conscientiously enforce federal law requiring financial reporting and transparency by labor unions 
we advocate paycheck protection laws to guard the integrity of the political process and the security of workers earnings 
the recent attempt by congressional democrats to deny workers a secret ballot in union referenda is an assault not only against a fundamental principle of labor law but even more against the dignity and honor of the american work force 
we oppose card check legislation which deprives workers of their privacy and their right to vote because it exposes workers to intimidation by union organizers 
homeownership remains key to creating an opportunity society 
we support timely and carefully targeted aid to those hurt by the housing crisis so that affected individuals can have a chance to trade a burdensome mortgage for a manageable loan that reflects their homes market value 
at the same time government action must not implicitly encourage anyone to borrow more than they can afford to repay 
we support energetic federal investigation and where appropriate prosecution of criminal wrongdoing in the mortgage industry and investment sector 
we do not support government bailouts of private institutions 
government interference in the markets exacerbates problems in the marketplace and causes the free market to take longer to correct itself 
we believe in the free market as the best tool to sustained prosperity and opportunity for all 
we encourage potential buyers to work in concert with the lending community to educate themselves about the responsibilities of purchasing a home condo or land 
republican policy aims to make owning a home more accessible through enforcement of open housing laws voucher programs urban homesteading and — what is most important — a strong economy with low interest rates 
because affordable housing is in the national interest any simplified tax system should continue to encourage homeownership recognizing the tremendous social value that the home mortgage interest deduction has had for decades 
in addition sound housing policy should recognize the needs of renters so that apartments and multifamily homes remain important components of the housing stock 
the rule of law demands that injured parties have access to the forums to vindicate their rights but the rule of law does not mean the rule of lawyers — especially trial lawyers who manipulate the system to enrich themselves rather than protecting consumers workers or taxpayers 
while no one should be denied access to the courts the rule of lawyers threatens our global competitiveness denies americans access to the quality of justice they deserve and puts every small business one lawsuit away from bankruptcy 
the republican approach to eliminate frivolous lawsuits has advanced in congress through efforts like the class action fairness act and in many states through the adoption of medical liability reforms which we will continue to pursue on the federal and state level 
but because their democratic donees currently control congress the trial lawyers are on the offensive 
they are trying to undermine federal health and safety regulations by allowing trial lawyers at the state level to preempt the reasoned judgments of independent experts 
they seek to weaken lowercost dispute resolution alternatives such as mediation and arbitration in order to put more cases into court 
in bill after bill their congressional allies insert new private causes of action — trial lawyer earmarks — designed to drag more americans into court 
our repeated warnings about the corruption at the heart of the trial bar have been vindicated by highprofile criminal convictions and prison terms for some of the nations leading class action and personal injury trial lawyers 
all plaintiffs especially those who must hire personal injury lawyers on a contingency basis should be protected against abuse by their attorneys and the attorneyclient privilege should be defended as a bulwark in the defense of liberty 
greater international trade aggressively advanced on a truly level playing field will mean more american jobs higher wages and a better standard of living 
it is also a matter of national security and an instrument to promote democracy and civil society in developing nations 
with percent of the worlds customers outside our borders we need to be at the table when trade rules are written to make sure that free trade is indeed a twoway street 
we encourage multilateral regional and bilateral agreements to reduce trade barriers that limit market access for us products commodities and services 
to achieve that goal congress should reinstate the trade promotion authority every president should have in dealing with foreign governments 
trade agreements that have already been signed and are pending before congress should be debated and voted on immediately 
an aggressive trade strategy is especially important with regard to agriculture 
our farm economy produces for the world its prosperity depends more than ever before on open markets 
us agricultural exports will top billion this year 
we will contest any restrictions upon our farm products within the world trade organization and will work to make the wtos decisionmaking process more receptive to the arguments of american producers 
we pledge stronger action to protect intellectual property rights against pirating and will aggressively oppose the direct and indirect subsidies by which some governments tilt the world playing field against american producers 
to protect american consumers we call for greater vigilance and more resources to guard against the importation of tainted food poisonous products and dangerous toys 
additionally we recognize the need to support our growth in trade through appropriate development and support of our ports in order to ensure safe efficient and timely handling of all goods 
farming communities have been hard hit this year by flood and violent weather as well as the escalation of fuel costs 
especially under those circumstances federal agricultural aid should go to those who need it most as part of a sensible economic safetynet for farmers 
we advocate the creation of farm savings accounts to help growers manage risks brought on by turbulence in global markets and nature itself 
mindful that percent of the million farms in this country are owned by individuals or family farming partnerships we affirm our fight against the death tax 
those who live on and work the land are our finest environmental stewards 
they understand better than most the need for safe water clean air and conservation of open space 
we oppose attempts to hamper agricultural production with heavyhand ed mandates including any expansion of the clean water act to regulate ditches culverts converted cropland and farm and stock ponds 
we reaffirm traditional state supremacy over water allocations and will continue to make available renewable rangeland under sound environmental conditions 
we support greater investment in conservation incentive programs to help rural communities improve and sustain environmental quality 
agricultural policy should be formulated by giving careful consideration to the expert opinions of those most knowledgeable on the topic — the farmers and ranchers 
to meet surging global demand for food and biofuel farmers must have the technology to grow higher yields using fewer inputs 
the usda must remain the international leader in agricultural research to ensure that america and the world will never have to choose between food and fuel 
the us government should end mandates for ethanol and let the free market work 
all americans are acutely aware of the energy crisis our nation faces 
energy costs are spiraling upward food prices continue to rise and as a result our entire economy suffers 
this winter families will spend for heat what they could have saved for college and small businesses will spend for fuel what could have covered employee health insurance 
our current dependence on foreign fossil fuels threatens both our national security and our economy and could also force drastic changes in the way we live 
the ongoing transfer of americans wealth to opec — roughly billion a year — helps underwrite terrorists operations and creates little incentive for repressive regimes to accept democracy whether in the middle east or latin america 
it didnt have to be this way and it must not stay this way 
our nation must have a robust energy supply because energy drives prosperity and increases opportunity for every american 
we reject the idea that america can not overcome its energy challenges — or that high gasoline prices are okay as long as they are phased in gradually 
we reject halfmeasures and believe no we cant is not a viable energy policy 
together we can build a future around domestic energy sources that are diverse reliable and cleaner 
we can strengthen our national security create a pathway to growing prosperity and preserve our environment 
the american people will rise to this challenge 
we must aggressively increase our nations energy supply in an environmentally responsible way and do so through a comprehensive strategy that meets both short and long term needs 
no amount of wishing or hoping can suspend the laws of supply and demand 
leading economists agree that any actions that will increase future energy supplies will lead to lower energy prices today 
increasing our production of american made energy and reducing our excessive reliance on foreign oil will bring down the high cost of gasoline and diesel fuel 
create more jobs for american workers 
enhance our national security 
in the long run american production should move to zeroemission sources and our nations fossil fuel resources are the bridge to that emissionsfree future 
if we are to have the resources we need to achieve energy independence we simply must draw more american oil from american soil 
we support accelerated exploration drilling and development in america from new oilfields off the nation ’ s coasts to onshore fields such as those in montana north dakota and alaska 
the green river basin in colorado utah and wyoming offers recoverable shale oil that is ready for development and most of it is on federal lands 
to deliver that energy to american consumers we will expand our refining capacity 
because of environmental extremism and regulatory blockades in washington not a single new refinery has been built in this country in years 
we will encourage refinery construction and modernization and with sensitivity to environmental concerns an expedited permitting process 
any legislation to increase domestic exploration drilling and production must minimize any protracted legal challenges that could unreasonably delay or even preclude actual production 
we oppose any efforts that would permanently block access to the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge 
nuclear energy is the most reliable zerocarbon emissions source of energy that we have 
unwarranted fear mongering with no relationship to current technologies and safeguards has prevented us from starting construction of a single nuclear power plant in years 
meanwhile the us navy has for decades relied upon nuclearpowered vessels and other nations have harnessed nuclear power to pro vide a major portion of their energy consumption 
there is no reason why the united states can not catch up and do the same 
confident in the promise offered by science and technology republicans will pursue dramatic increases in the use of all forms of safe affordable reliable — and clean — nuclear power 
as new plants are constructed using the highest safety and operation standards the nation ’ s industrial and manufacturing base will be rejuvenated 
the labor force will expand with nearly high quality jobs created for every new nuclear plant built — and those workers will lead the nation away from its dependence on foreign oil 
alternate power sources must enter the mainstream 
the technology behind solar energy has improved significantly in recent years and the commercial development of wind power promises major benefits both in costs and in environmental protection 
republicans support these and other alternative energy sources including geothermal and hydropower and anticipate technological developments that will increase their economic viability 
we therefore advocate a longterm energy tax credit equally applicable to all renewable power sources 
republicans support measures to modernize the nation ’ s electricity grid to provide american consumers and businesses with more affordable reliable power 
we will work to unleash innovation so entrepreneurs can develop technologies for a more advanced and robust united states transmission system that meets our growing energy demands 
although alternate fuels will shape our energy future coal — americas most affordable and abundant energy resource and the source of most of our electricity — remains a strategic national resource that must play a major role in energy independence 
we look to innovative technology to transform america ’ s coal supplies into clean fuels capable of powering motor vehicles and aircraft 
we support coaltoliquid and gasification initiatives just as we support investment in the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies which can reduce emissions 
we firmly oppose efforts by democrats to block the construction of new coalfired power plants 
no strategy for reducing energy costs will be viable without a commitment to continued coal production and utilization 
natural gas is plentiful in north america but we can extract more and do a better job of distributing it nationwide to cook our food heat our homes and serve as a growing option as a transportation fuel 
both independently and in cooperation with alternative fuels natural gas will be an essential part of any longterm energy solution 
we must ensure it gets to consumers safely and quickly 
we embrace the open energy cooperation and trading relationship with our neighbors canada and mexico including proven oil reserves and vast untapped canadian hydroelectric generation 
while we grow our supplies we must also reduce our demand — not by changing our lifestyles but by putting the free market to work and taking advantage of technological breakthroughs 
conservation does not mean deprivation it means efficiency and achieving more with less 
most americans today endeavor to conserve fossil fuels whether in their cars or in their home heating but we can do better 
we can construct better and smarter buildings use smarter thermostats and transmission grids increase recycling and make energyefficient consumer purchases wireless communications for example can increase telecommuting options and cut back on business travel 
the republican goal is to ensure that americans have more conservation options that will enable them to make the best choices for their families 
we must continue to develop alternative fuels such as biofuels especially cellulosic ethanol and hasten their technological advances to nextgeneration production 
as america develops energy technology for the st century policy makers must consider the burden that rising food prices and energy costs create for the poor and developing nations around the world 
because alternative fuels are useless if vehicles can not use them we must move quickly to flexible fuel vehicles we can not expect necessary investments in alternative fuels if this flexibility does not become standard 
we must also produce more vehicles that operate on electricity and natural gas both to reduce demand for oil and to cut co emissions 
given that fully percent of our current transportation vehicles rely on oil we will aggressively support technological advances to reduce our petroleum dependence 
for example lightweight composites could halve the weight and double the gas mileage of cars and trucks and together with flexfuel and electric vehicles could usher in a renaissance in the american auto industry 
by increasing our american energy supply and decreasing the long term demand for oil we will be well positioned to address the challenge of climate change and continue our longstanding responsibility for stewardship over the environment 
the same human economic activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere 
while the scope and longterm consequences of this are the subject of ongoing scientific research common sense dictates that the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today to reduce any impact on the environment 
those steps if consistent with our global competitiveness will also be good for our national security our energy independence and our economy 
any policies should be global in nature based on sound science and technology and should not harm the economy 
as part of a global climate change strategy republicans support technologydriven marketbased solutions that will decrease emissions reduce excess greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere increase energy efficiency mitigate the impact of climate change where it occurs and maximize any ancillary benefits climate change might offer for the economy 
to reduce emissions in the short run we will rely upon the power of new technologies as dis cussed above especially zeroemission energy sources such as nuclear and other alternate power sources 
but innovation must not be hamstrung by washington bickering regulatory briar patches or obstructionist law suits 
empowering washington will only lead to unintended consequences and unimagined economic and environmental pain instead we must unleash the power of scientific know how and competitive markets 
because the issue of climate change is global it must become a truly global concern as well 
all developed and developing economies particularly india and china can make significant contributions in dealing with the matter 
it would be unrealistic and counterproductive to expect the us to carry burdens which are more appropriately shared by all 
because republicans believe that solutions to the risk of global climate change will be found in the ingenuity of the american people we propose a climate prize for scientists who solve the challenges of climate change 
honoraria of many millions of dollars would be a small price for technological developments that eliminate our need for gaspowered cars or abate atmospheric carbon 
republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by the aficionados of centralized commandandcontrol government 
we can — and should — address the risk of climate change based on sound science without succumbing to the nogrowth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly 
a robust economy will be essential to dealing with the risk of climate change and we will insist on reasonable policies that do not force americans to sacrifice their way of life or trim their hopes and dreams for their children 
this perspective serves not only the people of the united states but also the worlds poorest peoples who would suffer terribly if climate change is severe — just as they would if the world economy itself were to be crippled 
we must not allow either outcome 
the republican perspective on the environment is in keeping with our longstanding appreciation for nature and gratitude for the bounty the almighty has bestowed upon the american people 
it was republican president theodore roosevelt who said the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem 
unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others 
we agree 
whether through family vacations hunting or fishing trips backpacking excursions or weekend hikes americans of all backgrounds share a commitment to protecting the environment and the opportunities it offers 
in addition the public should have access to public lands for recreational activities such as hunting hiking and fishing 
in caring for the land and water private ownership has been the best guarantee of conscientious stewardship while the worlds worst instances of environmental degradation have occurred under governmental control 
by the same token it is no accident that the most economically advanced countries also have the strongest environmental protections 
our national progress toward cleaner air and water has been a major accomplishment of the american people 
by balancing environmental goals with economic growth and job creation our diverse economy has made possible the investment needed to safeguard natural resources protect endangered species and create healthier living conditions 
state and local initiatives to clean up contaminated sites — brownfields — have exceeded efforts directed by washington 
that progress can continue if grounded in sound science longterm planning and a multiuse approach to resources 
government at all levels should protect private property rights by cooperating with landowners efforts and providing incentives to protect fragile environments endangered species and maintain the natural beauty of america 
republican leadership has led to the rejuvenation and renewal of our national park system 
future expansion of that system as well as designation of national wilderness areas or historic districts should be undertaken only with the active participation and consent of relevant state and local governments and private property owners 
americans have the best doctors the best hospitals the most innovative medical technology and the best scientists in the world 
our challenge and opportunity is to build around them the best health care system 
republicans believe the key to real reform is to give control of the health care system to patients and their health care providers not bureaucrats in government or business 
there are reasons why american families and businesses are dissatisfied with the current state of health care most americans work longer and harder to pay for health care 
dedicated health care providers are changing careers to avoid litigation 
the need to hold onto health insurance is driving family decisions about where to live and work 
many new parents worry about the loss of coverage if they choose to stay at home with their children 
the need — and the bills — for longterm care are challenging families and government alike 
american businesses are becoming less competitive in the global marketplace because of insurance costs 
some federal programs with no benefit to patients have grown exponentially adding layers of bureaucracy between patients and their care 
it is not enough to offer only increased access to a system that costs too much and does not work for millions of americans 
the republican goal is more ambitious better health care for lower cost 
how do we ensure that all americans have the peace of mind that comes from owning highquality comprehensive health coverage 
the first rule of public policy is the same as with medicine do no harm 
the american people rejected democrats attempted government takeover of health care in and they remain skeptical of politicians who would send us down that road 
republicans support the private practice of medicine and oppose socialized medicine in the form of a governmentrun universal health care system 
republicans pledge that as we reform our health care system we will protect citizens against any and all risky restructuring efforts that would complicate or ration health care 
we will encourage health promotion and disease prevention 
we will facilitate cooperation not confrontation among patients providers payers and all stakeholders in the health care system 
we will not put government between patients and their health care providers 
we will not put the system on a path that empowers washington bureaucrats at the expense of patients 
we will not raise taxes instead of reducing health care costs 
we will not replace the current system with the staggering inefficiency maddening irrationality and uncontrollable costs of a government monopoly 
radical restructuring of health care would be unwise 
we want all americans to be able to choose the best health care provider hospital and health coverage for their needs 
we believe that real reform is about improving your access to a health care provider your control over care and your ability to afford that care 
we will continue to advocate for simplification of the system and the empowerment of patients 
this is in stark contrast to the other partys insistence on putting washington in charge of patient care which has blocked any progress on meeting these goals 
we offer a detailed program that will improve the quality cost and coverage of health care throughout the nation and we will turn that plan into reality 
republicans believe all americans should be able to obtain an affordable health care plan including a health savings account which meets their needs and the needs of their families 
families and health care providers are the key to real reform not lawyers and bureaucrats 
to empower families we must make insurance more affordable and more secure and give employees the option of owning coverage that is not tied to their job 
patients should not have to worry about losing their insurance 
insurance companies should have to worry about losing patients ’ business 
the current tax system discriminates against individuals who do not receive health care from their employers gives more generous health tax benefits to upper income employees and fails to provide every american with the ability to purchase an affordable health care plan 
republicans propose to correct inequities in the current tax code that drive up the number of uninsured and to level the playing field so that individuals who choose a health insurance plan in the individual market face no tax penalty 
all americans should receive the same tax benefit as those who are insured through work whether through a tax credit or other means 
individuals with preexisting conditions must be protected we will help these individuals by building on the experiences of innovative states rather than by creating a new unmanageable federal entitlement 
we strongly urge that managed care organizations use the practice patterns and medical treatment guidelines from the state in which the patient lives when making medical coverage decisions 
because the family is our basic unit of society we fully support parental rights to consent to medical treatment for their children including mental health treatment drug treatment alcohol treatment and treatment involving pregnancy contraceptives and abortion 
while delivering control of health coverage to families and individuals republicans will also advance a variety of targeted reforms to improve the quality of care lower costs and help americans — men women and children — live longer and healthier lives 
chronic diseases — in many cases preventable conditions — are driving health care costs consuming three of every four health care dollars 
we can reduce demand for medical care by fostering personal responsibility within a culture of wellness while increasing access to preventive services including improved nutrition and breakthrough medications that keep people healthy and out of the hospital 
to reduce the incidence of diabetes cancer heart disease and stroke we call for a national grassroots campaign against obesity especially among children 
we call for continuation of efforts to decrease use of tobacco especially among the young 
a culture of wellness needs to include the treatment of mental health conditions 
we believe all americans should have access to affordable quality health care including individuals struggling with mental illness 
for this reason we believe it is important that mental health care be treated equally with physical health care 
clear information about health care empowers patients 
it lets consumers make better decisions about where to spend their health care dollars thereby fostering competition and lowering costs 
patients must have information to make sound decisions about their health care providers hospitals and insurance companies 
advances in medical technology are revolutionizing medicine 
information technology is key to early detection and treatment of chronic disease as well as fetal care and health care in rural areas — especially where our growing wireless communications network is available 
the simple step of modernizing recordkeeping will mean faster more accurate treatment fewer medical errors and lower costs 
closing the health care information gap can reduce both underutilization the diabetic who forgets to refill an insulin prescription and overutilization the patient who endures repetitive tests because providers have not shared test results 
every patient must have access to legal remedies for malpractice but meritless lawsuits drive up insurance rates to outrageous levels and ultimately drive up the number of uninsured 
frivolous lawsuits also drive up the cost of health care as health care providers are forced to practice defensive medicine such as ordering unnecessary tests 
many leave their practices rather than deal with the current system 
this emergency demands medical liability reform 
patients deserve access to health care providers they trust who will personalize and coordinate their care to ensure they receive the right treatment with the right health care provider at the right time 
providers should be paid for keeping people well not for the number of tests they run or procedures they perform 
the current cookiecutter system of reimbursement needs restructuring from the view of the patient not the accountant or washington bureaucrat 
a stateregulated national market for health insurance means more competition more choice and lower costs 
families — as well as fraternal societies churches and community groups and small employers — should be able to purchase policies across state lines 
the best practices and lowest prices should be available in every state 
we call upon state legislators to carefully consider the cost of medical mandates and we salute those republican governors who are leading the way in demonstrating ways to provide affordable health care options 
the financial burdens and emotional challenges of ensuring adequate care for elderly family members affect every american especially with todays aging population 
we must develop new ways to support individuals not just institutions so that older americans can have a real choice whether to stay in their homes 
this is true not only with regard to medicaid where we spend billion annually on longterm care but also for those who do not qualify for that assistance 
we believe in the importance of primary care specialties and supporting the physicians role in the evaluation and management of disease 
we also encourage practice in rural and underserved areas of america 
we support federal investment in basic and applied biomedical research 
this commitment will maintain americas global competitiveness advance innovative science that can lead to medical breakthroughs and turn the tide against diseases affecting millions of americans — diseases that account for the majority of our health care costs 
the united states leads in this research as evidenced by our growing biotechnology industry but foreign competition is increasing 
one way government can help preserve the promise of american innovation is to ensure that our intellectual property laws remain robust 
federal research dollars should be spent as though lives are at stake — because in fact they are 
research protocols must consider the special needs of formerly neglected groups if we are to make significant progress against breast and prostate cancer diabetes and other killers 
taxpayerfunded medical research must be based on sound science with a focus on both prevention and treatment and in accordance with the humane ethics of the hippocratic oath 
in that regard we call for a major expansion of support for the stemcell research that now shows amazing promise and offers the greatest hope for scores of diseases — with adult stem cells umbilical cord blood and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life 
we call for a ban on human cloning and a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes 
we believe medicines and treatments should be designed to prolong and enhance life not destroy it 
therefore federal funds should not be used for drugs that cause the destruction of human life 
furthermore the drug enforcement administration ban on use of controlled substances for physicianassisted suicide should be restored 
the health care profession can be both a profession and a calling 
no health care professional — doctor nurse or pharmacist — or organization should ever be required to perform provide for or refer for a health care service against their conscience for any reason 
this is especially true of the religious organizations which deliver a major portion of america ’ s health care a service rooted in the charity of faith communities 
we support the provision of quality and accessible health care options for our nation ’ s seniors and disabled individuals and recognize that in order to meet this goal we must confront the special challenges posed by the growth of medicare costs 
its projected growth is out of control and threatens to squeeze out other programs while funding constraints lead to restricted access to treatment for many seniors 
there are solutions 
medicare can be a leader for the rest of our health care system by encouraging treatment of the whole patient 
specifically we should compensate doctors who coordinate care especially for those with multiple chronic conditions and eliminate waste and inefficiency 
medicare patients must have more control of their care and choice regarding their doctors and the benefits of competition must be delivered to the patients themselves if medicare is to provide quality health care 
and medicare patients must be free to add their own funds if they choose to any government benefits to be assured of unrationed care 
finally because it is isolated from the free market forces that encourage innovation competition affordability and expansion of options medicare is especially susceptible to fraud and abuse 
the program loses tens of billions of dollars annually in erroneous and fraudulent payments 
we are determined to root out the fraud and eliminate this assault on the taxpayer 
our medicaid obligations will consume trillion over the next ten years 
medicaid now accounts for percent of state budgets and threatens to overwhelm state governments for the indefinite future 
we can do better while spending less 
a first step is to give medicaid recipients more health care options 
several states have allowed beneficiaries to buy regular health insurance with their medicaid dollars 
this removes the medicaid stamp from people ’ s foreheads provides beneficiaries with better access to doctors and saves taxpayers money 
we must ensure that taxpayer money is focused on caring for us citizens and other individuals in our country legally 
to protect the american people from the threats we face in the century ahead we must develop and stockpile medicines and vaccines so we can deliver them where urgently needed 
our health care infrastructure must have the surge capacity to handle large numbers of patients in times of crisis whether it is a repeat of hurricane katrina a flu pandemic or a bioterror attack on multiple cities 
republicans will ensure that this infrastructure including the needed communications capacity is closely integrated into our homeland security needs 
education is a parental right a state and local responsibility and a national strategic interest 
maintaining americas preeminence requires a worldclass system of education with high standards in which all students can reach their potential 
that requires considerable improvement over our current percent high school graduation rate and sixyear graduation rate of only percent for colleges 
education is essential to competitiveness but it is more than just training for the work force of the future 
it is through education that we ensure the transmission of a culture a set of values we hold in common 
it has prepared generations for responsible citizenship in a free society and it must continue to do so 
our party is committed to restoring the civic mission of schools envisioned by the founders of the american public school system 
civic education both in the classroom and through service learning should be a cornerstone of american public education and should be central to future school reform efforts 
all children should have access to an excellent education that empowers them to secure their own freedom and contribute to the betterment of our society 
we reaffirm the principles that have been the foundation of the nation ’ s educational progress toward that goal accountability for student academic achievement periodic testing on the fundamentals of learning especially math and reading history and geography transparency so parents and the general public know which schools best serve their students and flexibility and freedom to innovate so schools and districts can best meet the needs of their students 
we advocate policies and methods that are proven and effective building on the basics especially phonics ending social promotion merit pay for good teachers classroom discipline parental involvement and strong leadership by principals 
we reject a onesizefitsall approach and support parental options including home schooling and local innovations such as schools or classes for boys only or for girls only and alternative and innovative school schedules 
we recognize and appreciate the importance of innovative education environments particularly homeschooling for stimulating academic achievement 
we oppose overreaching judicial decisions which deny children access to such environments 
we support state efforts to build coordination between elementary and secondary education and higher education such as k councils and dual credit programs 
to ensure that all students will have access to the mainstream of american life we support the english first approach and oppose divisive programs that limit students future potential 
all students must be literate in english our common language to participate in the promise of america 
the family is the most powerful influence on a childs ability to succeed 
as such parents are our childrens first and foremost teachers 
we support family literacy which improves the literacy language and life skills of both parents and children along with the continued improvement of early childhood programs such as head start from lowincome families 
we reaffirm our support for the child care tax credit that helps parents choose the care best for their family 
for students to meet world class standards they must have access to world class teachers whether in person or through virtual public schools that can bring highquality instruction into the classroom 
school districts must have the authority to recruit reward and retain the best and brightest teachers and principals must have the authority to select and assign teachers without regard to collective bargaining agreements 
because qualified teachers are often not available through traditional routes we support local efforts to create an adjunct teacher corps of experts from higher education business and the military to fill in when needed 
teachers must be protected against frivolous litigation and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom 
we encourage the privatepublic partnerships and mentoring that can make classroom time more meaningful to students by integrating it with learning beyond school walls 
these efforts are crucial to lowering the dropout rate and helping atrisk students realize their potential 
we encourage state efforts to ensure that personnel who interact with children pass thorough background checks and are held to the highest standards of conduct 
partnerships between schools and businesses can be especially important in stem subjects science technology engineering and math 
the need to improve secondary education in those fields can be measured by the number of remedial courses now offered at the college level 
our countrys reliance upon foreign talent in those areas begins with insufficient emphasis upon them in the high school years 
we applaud those who are changing that situation by giving young people realworld experience in the private sector and by providing students with rigorous technical and academic courses that give students the skills and knowledge necessary to be productive members in a competitive american workforce 
parents should be able to decide the learning environment that is best for their child 
we support choice in education for all families especially those with children trapped in dangerous and failing schools whether through charter schools vouchers or tax credits for attending faithbased or other nonpublic schools or the option of home schooling 
we call for the vigilant enforcement of laws designed to protect family rights and privacy in education 
we will energetically assert the right of students to engage in voluntary prayer in schools and to have equal access to school facilities for religious purposes 
we renew our call for replacing family planning programs for teens with increased funding for abstinence education which teaches abstinence until marriage as the responsible and expected standard of behavior 
abstinence from sexual activity is the only protection that is percent effective against outof wedlock pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids when transmitted sexually 
we oppose schoolbased clinics that provide referrals counseling and related services for abortion and contraception 
schools should not ask children to answer offensive or intrusive personal nonacademic questionnaires without parental consent it is not the role of the teacher or school administration to recommend or require the use of psychotropic medications that must be prescribed by a physician 
although the constitution assigns the federal government no role in local education washingtons authority over the nations schools has increased dramatically 
in less than a decade annual federal funding has shot up percent to almost billion while the regulatory burden on state and local governments has risen by about million hours — and added million in costs — during that time 
we call for a review of department of education programs and administration to identify and eliminate ineffective programs to respect the role of states and to better meet state needs 
to get our schools back to the basics of learning we support initiatives to blockgrant more department of education funding to the states with requirements for statelevel standards assessments and public reporting to ensure transparency 
local educators must be free to end ineffective programs and reallocate resources where they are most needed 
because a federal mandate on the states must include the promised federal funding we will fulfill the promise of the individuals with disabilities education act to cover percent of the costs incurred because of that legislation 
we urge preventive efforts in early childhood especially assistance in gaining prereading skills to help many youngsters move beyond the need for idea ’ s protections 
our countrys system of higher education — public and private secular and religious large and small institutions — is unique for its excellence its diversity and its accessibility 
learning is a safeguard of liberty 
postsecondary education not only increases the earnings of individuals but advances economic development 
our colleges and universities drive much of the research that keeps america competitive 
we must ensure that our higher education system meet the needs of the st century student and economy and remain innovative and accessible 
students and their parents face formidable challenges in planning for college as costs continue to outpace inflation 
higher education seems immune from market controls and the law of supply and demand 
we commend those institutions which are directing a greater proportion of their endowment revenues toward tuition relief 
the republican vision for expanding access to higher education has led to two major advances education savings accounts and section accounts by which millions of families now save for college 
while federal student loans and grants have opened doors to learning for untold numbers of lowand middleincome students the overall financial aid system with its daunting forms and confused rationales is nothing less than byzantine 
it must be simplified 
we call for a presidential commission to undertake that task and to review the role of government regulations and policies in the tuition spiral 
we affirm our support for the publicprivate partnership that now offers students and their families a vibrant marketplace in selecting their student loan provider 
the challenge to american higher education is to make sure students can access education in whatever forms they want 
as mobility increases in all aspects of american life student mobility from school to school and from campus to campus will require new approaches to admissions evaluations and credentialing 
distance learning propelled by an expanding telecommunications sector and especially broadband is certain to grow in importance — whether through public or private institutions — and federal law should not discriminate against the latter 
lifelong learning will continue to transform the demographics of higher education bringing older students and realworld experience to campus 
community colleges are central to the future of higher education especially as they build bridges between the world of work and the classroom 
many of our returning veterans find community colleges to be welcoming environments where they can develop specific skills for use in the civilian workforce 
as the first responders to economic development and retraining of workers these schools fulfill our national commitment of an affordable and readily accessible education for all 
free speech on college campuses is to be celebrated but there should be no place in academia for antisemitism or racism of any kind 
we oppose the hiring firing tenure and promotion practices at universities that discriminate on the basis of political or ideological belief 
when federal taxes are used to support such practices it is inexcusable 
we affirm the right of students and faculty to express their views in the face of the leftist dogmatism that dominates many institutions 
to preserve the integrity and independence of the nation s colleges we will continue to ensure alternatives to ideological accrediting systems 
because some of the nation ’ s leading universities create or tolerate a hostile atmosphere toward the rotc we will rigorously enforce the provision of law unanimously upheld by the supreme court which denies those institutions federal research grants unless their military students have the full rights and privileges of other students 
that must include the right to engage in rotc activities on their own campus rather than being segregated elsewhere 
republicans remain the party of vigorous action against crime and the party that empowers the lawabiding by protecting their right to keep and bear arms for selfprotection 
our national experience over the past twenty years has shown that vigilance tough yet fair prosecutors meaningful sentences protection of victims rights and limits on judicial discretion protect the innocent by keeping criminals off the streets 
the internet must be made safe for children 
thats why republicans have led efforts to increase the funding necessary to track down and jail online predators through the adam walsh act 
we commit to do whatever it takes using all the tools of innovative technology to thwart those who would prey upon our children 
we call on service providers to exercise due care to ensure that the internet can not become a safe haven for criminals 
child pornography is a hideous form of child abuse 
those who produce it — and those who traffic in it — must be punished to the maximum extent of the law 
because it is an international problem the executive branch must carry the fight overseas to where the molesters perpetrate their evil 
congress should expand the range of companies required to report the existence of child pornography and we congratulate the social networking sites that agree to bar known sex offenders from participation 
millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families 
we support the law prohibiting gambling over the internet 
gang violence is a growing problem not only in urban areas but in many suburbs and rural communities 
it has escalated with the rise of gangs composed largely of illegal aliens most of whose victims are lawabiding members of immigrant communities 
we call for stronger enforcement and deter mined prosecution of gang conspiracies 
illegal allien gang members must be removed from the united states immediately upon arrest or after the completion of any sentence imposed 
aliens convicted of crimes that render them removable from the united states must be removed as soon as possible after the completion of their sentences through the immediate transfer of their custody to immigration and customs enforcement 
criminals behind bars can not harm the general public to that end we support mandatory sentencing provisions for gang conspiracy crimes violent or sexual offenses against children rape and assaults resulting in serious bodily injury 
gang rape child rape and rape committed in the course of another felony deserve at the least mandatory life imprisonment 
we oppose the granting of parole to dangerous or repeat felons 
courts must have the option of imposing the death penalty in capital murder cases and other instances of heinous crime while federal review of those sentences should be streamlined to focus on claims of innocence and to prevent delaying tactics by defense attorneys 
we encourage the use of advanced technology to monitor nonviolent criminals 
public authorities at all levels must cooperate to regain control of the nation ’ s correctional institutions 
it is unacceptable that prison officers should live in fear of the inmates they guard 
similarly persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates 
we can not allow correctional facilities to become ethnic or racial battlegrounds 
breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are incarcerated 
deprived of a parent through no fault of their own these youngsters should be a special concern of our schools social services and religious institutions 
government at all levels should work with faithbased institutions that have proven track records in diverting young and first offenders from criminal careers through second chance and similar programs 
individuals including juveniles who are repeat offenders or who commit serious crimes need to be prosecuted and punished 
in solidarity with those who protect us we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving bodily injury to law enforcement officers 
reviews of death sentences imposed for murdering a police officer should be expedited and a retrial of the penalty phase of the killers trial should be allowed in the absence of a unanimous verdict 
we support the right of offduty and retired officers to carry firearms 
criminals should be barred from seeking monetary damages for injuries they incur while committing a crime 
in recent years many federal resources for law enforcement have been shifted to the fight against terror 
to compensate for that loss of manpower — and with the significant increase in cybercrime identity theft and human trafficking — several thousand new fbi agents us marshals immigration officers and border patrol agents are needed 
the human toll of drug addiction and abuse hits all segments of american society 
it is an international problem as well with most of the narcotics in this country coming from beyond our borders 
we will continue the fight against producers traffickers and distributors of illegal substances through the collaboration of state federal and local law enforcement 
we support the work of those who help individuals struggling with addiction and we support strengthening drug education and prevention programs to avoid addiction 
we endorse state and local initiatives such as drug courts that are trying new approaches to curbing drug abuse and diverting firsttime offenders to rehabilitation 
twentysix years ago president reagan s task force on victims of crime calling the neglect of crime victims a national disgrace proposed a constitutional amendment to secure their formal rights 
today that disgrace persists in courtrooms across the nation 
innocent victims — battered women abused children the loved ones of the murdered — still may not be told when their case is being heard 
they can be excluded from the courtroom even when the defendant and his friends may be present 
they have no right to a speedy trial and a judge or parole board has no obligation to consider their personal safety in making release decisions 
in short the innocent have far fewer rights than the accused 
we call on congress to correct this imbalance by sending to the states for ratification a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims 
in addition crime victims should be assured of access to legal and social services and the crime victims fund established under president reagan should be used solely for that purpose 
because our constitution is based on the principles of individual liberty and limited government we must always ensure that law enforcement respects the civil and constitutional rights of the people 
while we wage war on terrorism in foreign lands it is sometimes necessary for intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials to pursue terrorist threats at home 
however no expansion of governmental powers should occur at the expense of our constitutional liberties 
the two most effective forces in reducing crime and other social ills are strong families and caring communities 
both reinforce constructive conduct and ethical standards by setting examples and providing safe havens from dangerous and destructive behaviors 
given the weight of social science evidence concerning the crucial role played by the traditional family in setting a childs future course we urge a thoughtful review of governmental policies and programs to ensure that they do not undermine that institution 
decentralized decisionmaking in the place of official controls empowers individuals and groups to tackle social problems in partnership with government 
bureaucracy is no longer a credible approach to helping those in need 
this is especially true in light of alternatives such as faithbased organizations which tend to have a greater degree of success than others in dealing with problems such as substance abuse and domestic violence 
to accomplish their missions those groups must be able to rely upon people who share their faith their hiring must not be subjected to government regulation and mandates 
from its founding america has been an idea as much as a political or geographic entity 
it has meant for untold millions around the world a set of ideals that speak to the highest aspirations of humanity 
from its own beginning the republican party has boldly asserted those ideals as we now do again to affirm the rights of the people under the rule of law 
we uphold the right of individual americans to own firearms a right which antedated the constitution and was solemnly confirmed by the second amendment 
we applaud the supreme courts decision in heller affirming that right and we assert the individual responsibility to safely use and store firearms 
we call on the next president to appoint judges who will similarly respect the constitution 
gun ownership is responsible citizenship enabling americans to defend themselves their property and communities 
we call for education in constitutional rights in schools and we support the option of firearms training in federal programs serving senior citizens and women 
we urge immediate action to review the automatic denial of gun ownership to returning members of the armed forces who have suffered trauma during service to their country 
we condemn frivolous lawsuits against firearms manufacturers which are transparent attempts to deprive citizens of their rights 
we oppose federal licensing of lawabiding gun owners and national gun registration as violations of the second amendment 
we recognize that gun control only affects and penalizes lawabiding citizens and that such proposals are ineffective at reducing violent crime 
individual rights — and the responsibilities that go with them — are the foundation of a free society 
from the time of lincoln equality of individuals has been a corner stone of the republican party 
our commitment to equal opportunity extends from landmark schoolchoice legislation for the students of washington dc to historic appointments at the highest levels of government 
we consider discrimination based on sex race age religion creed disability or national origin to be immoral and we will strongly enforce antidiscrimination statutes 
we ask all to join us in rejecting the forces of hatred and bigotry and in denouncing all who practice or promote racism antisemitism ethnic prejudice or religious intolerance 
as a matter of principle republicans oppose any attempts to create racebased governments within the united states as well as any domestic governments not bound by the constitution or the bill of rights 
precisely because we oppose discrimination we reject preferences quotas and setasides whether in education or in corporate boardrooms 
the government should not make contracts on this basis and neither should corporations 
we support efforts to help lowincome individuals get a fair shot based on their potential and merit and we affirm the commonsense approach of the chief justice of the united states that the way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating 
the symbol of our unity to which we all pledge allegiance is the flag 
by whatever legislative method is most feasible old glory should be given legal protection against desecration 
we condemn decisions by activist judges to deny children the opportunity to say the pledge of allegiance in public school 
we support freedom of speech and freedom of the press and oppose attempts to violate or weaken those rights such as reinstatement of the socalled fairness doctrine 
faithful to the first guarantee of the declaration of independence we assert the inherent dignity and sanctity of all human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed 
we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children 
we oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it 
we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity and dignity of innocent human life 
we have made progress 
the supreme court has upheld prohibitions against the barbaric practice of partialbirth abortion 
states are now permitted to extend healthcare coverage to children before birth 
and the born alive infants protection act has become law this law ensures that infants who are born alive during an abortion receive all treatment and care that is provided to all newborn infants and are not neglected and left to die 
we must protect girls from exploitation and statutory rape through a parental notification requirement 
we all have a moral obligation to assist not to penalize women struggling with the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy 
at its core abortion is a fundamental assault on the sanctity of innocent human life 
women deserve better than abortion 
every effort should be made to work with women considering abortion to enable and empower them to choose life 
we salute those who provide them alternatives including pregnancy care centers and we take pride in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed republican legislative initiatives 
respect for life requires efforts to include persons with disabilities in education employment the justice system and civic participation 
in keeping with that commitment we oppose the nonconsensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities as well as the elderly and infirm just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide which endanger especially those on the margins of society 
because government should set a positive standard in hiring and contracting for the services of persons with disabilities we need to update the statutory authority for the ability one program the main avenue by which those productive members of our society can offer high quality services at the best possible value 
because our childrens future is best preserved within the traditional understanding of marriage we call for a constitutional amendment that fully protects marriage as a union of a man and a woman so that judges can not make other arrangements equivalent to it 
in the absence of a national amendment we support the right of the people of the various states to affirm traditional marriage through state initiatives 
republicans recognize the importance of having in the home a father and a mother who are married 
the twoparent family still provides the best environment of stability discipline responsibility and character 
children in homes without fathers are more likely to commit a crime drop out of school become violent become teen parents use illegal drugs become mired in poverty or have emotional or behavioral problems 
we support the courageous efforts of singleparent families to provide a stable home for their children 
children are our nation ’ s most precious resource 
we also salute and support the efforts of foster and adoptive families 
republicans have been at the forefront of protecting traditional marriage laws both in the states and in congress 
a republican congress enacted the defense of marriage act affirming the right of states not to recognize samesex marriages licensed in other states 
unbelievably the democratic party has now pledged to repeal the defense of marriage act which would subject every state to the redefinition of marriage by a judge without ever allowing the people to vote on the matter 
we also urge congress to use its article iii section power to prevent activist federal judges from imposing upon the rest of the nation the judicial activism in massachusetts and california 
we also encourage states to review their marriage and divorce laws in order to strengthen marriage 
as the family is our basic unit of society we oppose initiatives to erode parental rights 
our constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids any religious test for public office and it likewise prohibits the establishment of a statesponsored creed 
the balance between those two ideals has been distorted by judicial rulings which attempt to drive faith out of the public arena 
the public display of the ten commandments does not violate the usconstitution and accurately reflects the judeochristian heritage of our country 
we support the right of students to engage in studentinitiated studentled prayer in public schools athletic events and graduation ceremonies when done in conformity with constitutional standards 
we affirm every citizens right to apply religious values to public policy and the right of faithbased organizations to participate fully in public programs without renouncing their beliefs removing religious objects or symbols or becoming subject to governmentimposed hiring practices 
forcing religious groups to abandon their beliefs as applied to their hiring practices is religious discrimination 
we support the first amendment right of freedom of association of the boy scouts of america and other service organizations whose values are under assault and we call upon the commonwealth of massachusetts to reverse its policy of blacklisting religious groups which decline to arrange adoptions by samesex couples 
respectful of our nations diversity in faith we urge reasonable accommodation of religious beliefs in the private workplace 
we deplore the increasing incidence of attacks against religious symbols as well as incidents of antisemitism on college campuses 
at the center of a free economy is the right of citizens to be secure in their property 
every person has the right to acquire own use possess enjoy and dispose of private property 
that right was undermined by the supreme courts kelo decision allowing local governments to seize a persons home or land not for vital public use but for transfer to private developers 
that to decision highlights what is at stake in the election of the next president who may make new appointments to the court 
we call on state legislatures to moot the kelo decision by appropriate legislation and we pledge on the federal level to pass legislation to protect against unjust federal takings 
we will enforce the takings clause of the fifth amendment to ensure just compensation whenever private property is needed to achieve a compelling public use 
we urge caution in the designation of national historic areas which can set the stage for widespread governmental control of citizens lands 
the federal government has a special responsibility to the people in indian country and a unique trust relationship with them which has been insufficiently honored 
the social and economic problems that plague indian country have grown worse over the last several decades and we must reverse that trend 
ineffective government programs deprive indians of the services they need and longterm failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself 
republicans believe that economic selfsufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges in indian country and that tribal communities not washington bureaucracies are better situated to craft local solutions 
federal — and state — regulations that thwart job creation must be reconsidered so that tribal governments acting on native americans behalf are not disadvantaged 
the democratic partys repeated undermining of tribal sovereignty to advantage union bosses is especially egregious 
republicans reject a onesizefitsall approach to federalstatetribal partnerships and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it 
better partnerships will help us to expand opportunity deliver topflight education to future generations modernize and improve the indian health service to make it more responsive to local needs and build essential infrastructure 
native americans must be empowered to develop the rich natural resources on their lands without undue federal interference 
crime in indian country especially against women is a special problem demanding immediate attention 
inadequate resources and neglect have made native americans less safe and allowed safe havens to develop in indian country for criminal narcotics enterprises 
the government must increase funding for tribal officers and investigators fbi agents prosecutors and tribal jails 
the legal system must provide stability and protect property rights 
everyones civil rights must be safeguarded including the right to due process and freedom of the press with accountability for all government officials 
we support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by native americans including alaska natives and native hawaiians and to preserve their culture and languages 
we honor the sacrifices of all native americans serving in the military today and in years past and will ensure that all veterans receive the care and respect they have earned through their service to america
