yttrium compounds erbium terbium ytterbium webelementscom ndash yttrium los alamos national laboratory ndash yttrium ytterbium chemical element symbol yb atomic number soft silvery metallic element ytterbium rare earth lanthanide series found minerals gadolinite monazite xenotime element sometimes associated yttrium related elements used certain steels natural ytterbium mix seven stable isotopes 
ytterbium soft malleable rather ductile element exhibits bright silvery luster rare earth element easily attacked dissolved mineral acids slowly reacts water oxidizes air 
ytterbium three allotropes called alpha beta gamma whose transformation points minus c c beta form exists room temperature facecentered crystal structure hightemperature gamma form bodycentered crystal structure 
normally beta form metallic like electrical conductivity becomes semiconductor exposed around atm gpa electrical resistivity tenfold larger atm gpa drops dramatically around room temperature resistivity value atm gpa 
ytterbium one lanthanides able become divalent like potentially divalent lanthanides samarium europium capable extracted mercury use sodium amalgam made one easier lanthanides purify using classical techniques however divalency discovered th century 
usually small anount yb used either small sample radioactive isotope source xrays small concentration dopant 
yb isotope used radiation source substitute portable xray machine electricity available like xrays gamma rays pass soft tissues body blocked bones dense materials thus small yb samples emit gamma rays act like tiny xray machines useful radiography small objects 
ytterbium could also used help improve grain refinement strength mechanical properties stainless steel ytterbium alloys used dentistry 
yb used dopant optics materials usially form ions active laser media several powerful doubleclad fiber lasers disk lasers use yb ions dopant concentration several atomic percent glasses optical fibers crystals ceramics yb used 
ytterbium often used doping material yb high power wavelengthtunable solid state lasers yb lasers commonly radiate µm band optically pumped wavelength nm µm dependently ghost application small quantum defect makes yb prospective dopant efficient lasers power scaling 
kinetic excitations ybdoped materials simple described within concept effective crosssections ybdoped laser materials mccumber relation holds although application ybdoped composite materials discussion 
usually low concentrtations yb used high concentration excitaitons ybdoped materials show photodarkening glass fibers ever switch broadband emission crystals ceramics instead efficient laser action 
ytterbium single absorption band nanometers used convert infrared energy electricity solar cells 
ytterbium discovered swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac marignac found new component earth known erbia named ytterbia ytterby swedish town found new erbia component suspected ytterbia compound new element called ytterbium 
french chemist georges urbain separated marignacs ytterbia two components neoytterbia lutecia neoytterbia would later become known element ytterbium lutecia would later known element lutetium auer von welsbach independently isolated elements ytterbia time called aldebaranium cassiopeium 
chemical physical properties ytterbium could determined first nearly pure ytterbium produced 
ytterbium found rare earth elements several rare minerals often recovered commercially monazite sand ytterbium element also found euxenite xenotime ytterbium normally difficult separate rare earths ionexchange solvent extraction techniques developed late th century simplified separation known compounds ytterbium raremdashthey havent well characterized yet
