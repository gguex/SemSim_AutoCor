little known nobelium small quantities ever produced known uses whatsoever outside laboratory stable isotope halflife minutes decays fm alpha decay md electron capture 
nobelium named alfred nobel first synthesized albert ghiorso glenn seaborg john r walton torbj√∏rn sikkeland april university california berkeley team used new heavy ion linear accelerator hilac bombard curium target cm cm c ions make halflife seconds work confirmed soviet researchers dubna 
year earlier however physicists nobel institute sweden announced synthesized isotope element team reported created isotope halflife minutes mev bombarding cm c nuclei based report commission atomic weights international union pure applied chemistry assigned accepted name nobelium symbol new element subsequent russian american efforts repeat experiment failed 
researchers uc berkeley confirmed experiments went show existence halflife halflife halflife next year ghiorsos group decided retain name nobelium element 
nobelium recent element news come harvard tom lehrer wrote elements song therefore element highest atomic number included 
radioisotopes nobelium characterized stable halflife minutes halflife minutes halflife minutes remaining radioactive isotopes halflives less seconds element also meta state mno seconds 
known isotopes nobelium range atomic weight u u primary decay mode stable isotope alpha emission primary mode spontaneous fission primary decay products element fermium isotopes primary products energy subatomic particles
