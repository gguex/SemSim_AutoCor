terbium discovered swedish chemist carl gustaf mosander detected impurity yttrium oxide named village ytterby sweden isolated pure form recent advent ion exchange techniques mosander first partitioned yttria three fractions terbia fraction contained pink color due known erbium erbia fraction essentially colorless solution gave browntinged oxide later workers difficulty observing latter pink fraction impossible miss arguments went back forth whether erbia even existed confusion original names got reversed exchange names stuck thought workers used double sodium potassium sulfates remove ceria yttria inadvertently lost terbium content system ceriacontaining precipitate case known terbium original yttria sufficient impart yellowish color oxide thus terbium minor component original terbium fraction dominated immediate neighbors gadolinium dysprosium thereafter whenever rare earths teased apart mixture whichever fraction gave brown oxide retained terbium name last pure th century investigators benefit fluorescence technology wherewith observe brilliant fluorescence would made element much easier track mixtures
terbium classified rare earth element term rare misleading terbium common metals silver mercury name rare earth meant something else early chemists used rare earth elements difficult separate rare earth rarely used anything also initially believed rare actually later discovered wasnt case
