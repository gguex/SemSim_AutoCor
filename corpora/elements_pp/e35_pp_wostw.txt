unlike semiconductors germanium small band gap allowing efficiently respond infrared light therefore used infrared spectroscopes optical equipment require extremely sensitive infrared detectors oxides index refraction dispersion properties make germanium useful wideangle camera lenses microscope objective lenses
germanium transistors still used stompboxes musicians wish reproduce distinctive tonal character fuzztone early rock roll era notably dallas arbiter fuzz face vintage stompboxes known contain germanium transistors shown marked increases collector value reason alone
germanium highly important infrared optical material readily cut polished lenses windows used particularly front optic thermal imaging cameras working micron wavelength range passive thermal imaging hotspot detection military fire fighting applications material high refractive index needs antireflection coated particularly hard special antireflection coating diamondlike carbon dlc refractive index good match produces diamondhard surface withstand much environmental rough treatment
alloy silicon germanide commonly referred silicongermanium sige rapidly becoming important semiconductor material use high speed integrated circuits circuits utilising properties sisige junctions much faster using silicon alone uses alloying agent see phosphor fluorescent lamps catalyst high purity germanium single crystal detectors precisely identify radiation sources eg airport security germanium substrate wafers highefficiency multijunction solar cells space applications
certain compounds germanium low toxicity mammals toxic effects certain bacteria property makes compounds useful chemotherapeutic agents
germanium useful single crystal neutron synchrotron xray monochromator beamlines reflectivity advantages silicon neutron high energy xray applications
