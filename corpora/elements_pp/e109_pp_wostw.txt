ununoctium temporary iupac name transactinide element atomic number also referred eka radon currently synthetic member noble gases group highest atomic number assigned reputedly discovered element temporary iupac element symbol uuo three atoms element detected name ununoctium systematic element name used placeholder confirmed research groups iupac decides name moskowium mk proposed russian discoverers permanent name element
late polish theoreticist robert smolanczuk published calculations fusion atomic nuclei towards synthesis superheavy atoms including element calculations suggested might possible make element fusing lead krypton carefully controlled conditions
researchers lawrence berkeley national laboratory made use predictions announced discovery elements paper published physical review letters soon results reported science researchers claimed performed reaction
following year published retraction researchers unable duplicate results june director lab announced original claim discovery two elements based data fabricated principal author victor ninov american group intended name ghiorsium albert ghiorso member research team retract claim
october researchers joint institute nuclear research jinr lawrence livermore national laboratory california usa working jinr dubna russia announced physical review c indirectly detected total three nuclei ununoctium one two produced via collisions californium atoms calcium ions
small fusion reaction probability fusion cross section pb experiment took months involved beam calcium ions shot californium target produce single recorded event believed synthesis element
experiment decay products three atoms ununoctium rather atoms observed halflife ms observed uuo decays uuh alpha decay since three nuclei halflife derived observed lifetimes large uncertainty ms
identification uuo nuclei verified separately creating putative daughter nucleus uuh means bombardment cm ca ions
checking uuh decay matched decay chain uuo nuclei
although halflife seems less millisecond still longer predicted thus giving support idea island stability concept proposed late uc berkeley professor glenn seaborg explains superheavy elements element last longer predicted
ununoctium electrons closed shell makes member noble gas group therefore likely similar properties members group resembling chemical properties noble gas periodic table radon known compounds ununoctium likely high ionization energy common oxidation state likely believed gas normal conditions
since three atoms ununoctium ever produced currently uses outside basic scientific research also occur biosphere never presents risk would constitute radiation hazard enough ever assembled one place
