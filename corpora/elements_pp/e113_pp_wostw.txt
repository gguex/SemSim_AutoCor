according island stability theory nuclides around area protons neutrons ie isotope uuq expected relatively stable comparison surrounding nuclides ununquadium occur naturally entirely synthesized laboratories isotopes ununquadium synthesized far neutronpoor means contain significantly fewer neutrons one magic number neutrons believed make isotope stable neutronpoor also indicates isotopes decay either spontaneous fission producing variety radionuclides positron emission electron capture yield element ununtrium far three made undergone spontaneous fission first milliseconds therefore never able studied
manufacturing ununquadium would difficult nuclei summing protons neutrons available weighable quantities
however may possible generate ununquadium nuclear transfer reactions achieved one reactions may
