curium synthetic chemical element symbol cm atomic number radioactive metallic transuranic element actinide series curium produced bombarding plutonium alpha particles helium ions named marie curie husband pierre
isotope curium synthesized milligram quantities curium curium made multigram amounts allows determination elements properties curium made quantity subjecting plutonium neutron bombardment curium occur nature commercial applications curium may one day useful radioisotope thermoelectric generators curium bioaccumulates bone tissue radiation destroys bone marrow thus stops red blood cell creation
rare earth element homolog curium somewhat chemically similar gadolinium complex crystal structure chemically reactive metal silverywhite color element electropositive aluminium trivalent curium compounds slightly yellow
curium studied greatly potential fuel radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtg curium generate watts thermal energy per gram wg however short halflife makes undesirable power source longterm use curium decay alpha emission plutonium common fuel rtgs curium also studied energy source rtgs maximum energy density wg produces large amount neutron radiation spontaneous fission curium year halflife good energy density wg would seem make ideal fuel produces significant amounts gamma beta radiation radioactive decay products

mox fuel irradiated fast reactor average samples burnup gwdt contained curium isotopic content
proportions three common curium isotopes mwdkg leu spent fuel years discharge reported page
neutron cross sections mostly ms neutrons
pattern oddmass number isotopes fissile evenmass number isotopes neutron capture slowly therefore evenmass isotopes accumulate thermal reactor burnup increases
mox used power reactors contain little curium neutron activation cm create californium strong neutron emitter californium would pollute back end fuel cycle increase dose workers hence minor actinides used fuel thermal neutron reactor curium excluded fuel placed special fuel rods actinide present
