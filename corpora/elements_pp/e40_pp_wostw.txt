hafnium shiny silvery ductile metal corrosion resistant chemically similar zirconium physical properties hafnium markedly affected zirconium impurities two elements among difficult ones separate notable physical difference density zirconium half dense hafnium chemically elements extremely similar
notable physical property hafnium high neutroncapture crosssection several isotopes hafnium nuclei absorb multiple neutrons makes hafnium good material use control rods nuclear reactors neutroncapture crosssection times zirconium elements good neutronabsorbers control rods cadmium boron
separation hafnium zirconium becomes important nuclear power industry since zirconium good fuelrod cladding metal desirable properties low neutron capture crosssection good chemical stability high temperatures however hafniums neutronabsorbing properties hafnium impurities zirconium would cause far less useful nuclear reactor materials applications thus nearlycomplete separation zirconium hafnium necessary use nuclear power
