trivalent metallic rare earth element holmium highest magnetic moment µb naturallyoccurring element possesses unusual magnetic properties combined yttrium forms highly magnetic compounds 
holmium relatively soft malleable element fairly corrosion resistant stable dry air standard temperature pressure moist air higher temperatures however quickly oxidizes forming yellowish oxide pure form holmium possesses metallic bright silvery luster holmium oxide fairly dramatic color changes depending lighting conditions daylight tannish yellow color trichromatic light fiery orange red almost indistinguishable way erbium oxide looks lighting sharp emission bands phosphors absorption bands oxides 
magnetic properties holmium used create strongest artificiallygenerated magnetic fields placed within highstrength magnets magnetic pole piece also called magnetic flux concentrator since absorb nuclear fission bred neutrons element also used nuclear control rods commercial applications element include 
high magnetic moment suitable use yttrium iron garnet yig yttrium lanthanum fluoride ylf solid state lasers found microwave equipment turn found variety medical dental settings 
holmium oxide used yellow red glass coloring holmium containing glass used calibration standard uvvisible spectrophotometers holmium one colorants used cubic zirconia use jewelry providing dichromic color peach yellow depending lighting source holmium used laser break kidney stones minimally invasive

holmium holmia latin name stockholm discovered marc delafontaine jacqueslouis soret noticed aberrant spectrographic absorption bands thenunknown element called element x later per teodor cleve independently discovered element working erbia earth erbium oxide 
using method developed carl gustaf mosander cleve first removed known contaminants erbia result effort two new materials one brown one green named brown substance holmia latin name cleves home town stockholm green one thulia holmia later found holmium oxide thulia thulium oxide 
like rare earths holmium naturally found free element occur combined elements minerals gadolinite monazite rareearth minerals commercially extracted via ionexchange monazite sand holmium still difficult separate rare earths element isolated reduction anhydrous chloride fluoride metallic calcium estimated abundance earth crust milligrams per kilogram holmium obeys oddoharkins rule oddnumbered element less abundant immediate even numbered neighbors dysprosium erbium however abundant oddnumbered heavy lanthanides principal current source ionadsorption clays southern china rare earth composition similar found xenotime gadolinite yttrium makes twothirds total weight holmium around original ores lean maybe total lanthanide easily extracted 
natural holmium contains one stable isotope holmium synthetic radioactive isotopes known stable one holmium half life years radioisotopes half lives greater days half lives hours 
element rare earths appears low acute toxic rating holmium plays biological role humans may able stimulate metabolism
