several different reasons argon used particular applications inert gas needed particular argon cheapest alternative diatomic nitrogen sufficiently inert low thermal conductivity required electronic properties ionization andor emission spectrum necessary
noble gases would probably work well applications argon far cheapest argon inexpensive since byproduct production liquid oxygen liquid nitrogen used large industrial scale noble gases except helium produced way well argon plentiful since highest concentration atmosphere bulk argon applications arise simply inert relatively cheap argon used fill gas incandescent lighting argon react filament light bulbs even high temperatures inert gas shield many forms welding including metal inert gas welding tungsten inert gas welding extinguishing fires damage equipment avoided see photo gas choice plasma used icp spectroscopy nonreactive blanket processing titanium reactive elements protective atmosphere growing silicon germanium crystals partial pressure heat treat furnaces museum conservators protect old materials documents prone gradual oxidation presence air keep open bottles wine oxidizing number dispensing units keeper cap systems winemaking top barrels displacing oxygen thus preventing wine turning vinegar aging process pharmaceutical industry top bottles intravenous drug preparations example intravenous paracetamol displacing oxygen therefore prolonging drugs shelflife used cool seeker head us air force version aim sidewinder missile gas stored high pressure expansion gas cools seeker
next common reason using argon low thermal conductivity used thermal insulation energy efficient windows argon also used technical scuba diving inflate dry suit inert low thermal conductivity
argon also used specific way ionizes emits light used plasma globes calorimetry experimental particle physics blue argon lasers used surgery weld arteries destroy tumors correct eye defects microelectronics argon ions used sputtering
finally number miscellaneous uses argon half life years used number applications primarily ice core ground water dating argon potassium ratio used dating igneous rocks
cryosurgery procedures cryoablation use liquified argon destroy cancer cells surgery used procedure called argon enhanced coagulation form argon plasma beam electrosurgery procedure carries risk producing gas embolism patient resulted death one person via type accident
argon constitutes volume mass earths atmosphere air primary raw material used industry produce purified argon products argon isolated air fractionation commonly cryogenic fractional distillation process also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton xenon
