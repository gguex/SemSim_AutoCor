discoveries chemical elements transuranic element isotopes ununoctium ununhexium ununpentium temporary name synthetic superheavy element periodic table temporary symbol uup atomic number multiple isotopes made fusion calcium americium uup neutrons referred eka bismuth 
element also falls center theoretical island stability although stable isotopes yet found conventional models predict stable isotopes element produced likely need magic number neutrons would uup currently fabricated isotopes neutrons uup 
february synthesis ununpentium ununtrium reported physical review c team composed russian scientists dubna universitys joint institute nuclear research american scientists lawrence livermore national laboratory 
team reported bombarded americium element calcium element produce four atoms ununpentium element atoms report alpha decayed ununtrium element approximately milliseconds ununtrium produced existed seconds decaying natural elements 
synthesizing element also reported scientists japan 
may joint institute nuclear research synthesis element confirmed another method chemical identifying final products decay element 
ununpentium temporary iupac systematic element name element also sometimes called ekabismuth 
element manufactured amount atoms chemistry element yet researched chemistry physics tell us lot expect although element group bismuth chemistry probably strongly altered relativistic effects one important predicted difference bismuth presence stable oxidation state uup ion chemistry similar tl experimental data superheavy elements element seems confirm relativistic effects superheavy elements 
ununpentium theorized inside island stability probably explains mentioned regularly popular culture especially ufo conspiracy theories popular account element bob lazar would require changes great many existing theories
