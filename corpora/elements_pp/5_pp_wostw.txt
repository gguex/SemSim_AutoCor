pure americium silvery white lustre room temperatures slowly tarnishes dry air silvery plutonium neptunium apparently malleable neptunium uranium alpha emission approximately three times radium gram quantities emit intense gamma rays creates serious exposure problem anyone handling element 
americium also fissile critical mass unreflected sphere approximately kilograms unlikely americium would used weapons material minimum critical mass considerably larger readily obtained plutonium uranium isotopes 
element produced kilogram amounts uses mostly since easier produce relatively pure samples isotope americium found way household one type smoke detector contains tiny amount microgram source ionizing radiation used portable gamma ray source use radiography element also employed gauge glass thickness help create flat glass neutron emitter found uses neutron radiography also cited use advanced nuclear rocket propulsion fuel isotope however extremely expensive produce usable quantities
