Dorothy lived|live%2:42:08:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: prairies, with Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: 
Henry, who was|be%2:42:03:: a farmer, and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, who was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer's wife. 
Their house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: small, for the lumber|lumber%1:27:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: it had|have%2:40:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:38:10:: 
by wagon|wagon%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles. There were|be%2:42:04:: four walls, a floor|floor%1:06:00:: and a roof, 
which made|make%2:42:05:: one room; and this room|room%1:06:00:: contained|contain%2:42:00:: a rusty|rusty%3:00:00:rusted:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
stove, a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, 
and the beds. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in one corner, 
and Dorothy a little|little%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in another corner. There was|be%2:42:00:: no garret|garret%1:06:00:: at 
all, and no cellar--except a small|small%3:00:00:: hole, dug|dig%2:35:01:: in the ground, called|call%2:32:02:: a 
cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: cellar, where the family|family%1:14:02:: could go|go%2:38:00:: in case|case%1:26:00:: one of those great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
whirlwinds|whirlwind%1:19:00:: arose, mighty|mighty%4:02:00:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 to crush|crush%2:30:00:: any building|building%1:06:00:: in its path. It 
was|be%2:42:03:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: by a trap-door in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the floor, from which a 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into the small, dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. 
 
When Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the doorway|doorway%1:06:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: around, she could see|see%2:39:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairie|prairie%1:15:00:: on every side. Not|not%4:02:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: nor a 
house|house%1:14:03:: broke|break%2:38:01:: the broad|broad%3:00:04:: sweep|sweep%1:07:00:: of flat|flat%3:00:00:even:01 country|country%1:15:01:: that reached|reach%2:38:00:: the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: in all directions. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: baked|baked%3:00:00:dry:01 the plowed|plow%2:36:00:: land|land%1:17:01:: into a 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 mass, with little|little%3:00:01:: cracks|crack%1:17:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through it. Even|even%4:02:00:: the grass|grass%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: green, for the sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: burned|burn%2:30:02:: the tops|top%1:15:01:: of the long|long%3:00:01:: blades|blade%1:20:00:: until 
they were|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:02:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. Once the house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: painted, but the sun|sun%1:17:00:: blistered|blister%2:30:01:: the paint|paint%1:06:00:: and the rains|rain%1:19:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: it 
away, and now|now%4:02:05:: the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: as dull|dull%3:00:00:unsaturated:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as everything else. 
 
 
When Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: came|come%2:38:04:: there|there%4:02:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: she was|be%2:42:03:: a young, pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 wife. The 
sun|sun%1:19:00:: and wind|wind%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: changed|change%2:30:01:: her, too. They had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the sparkle|sparkle%1:07:01:: from 
her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and left|leave%2:42:02:: them a sober|sober%3:00:00:serious:00 gray; they had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: the red|red%1:07:00:: from her 
cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: and lips, and they were|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 also. She was|be%2:42:03:: thin|thin%3:00:03:: and gaunt, 
and never|never%4:02:00:: smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: an orphan, first|first%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:04:: 
to her, Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: by the child's laughter|laughter%1:10:00:: that 
she would scream|scream%2:32:01:: and press|press%2:35:00:: her hand|hand%1:08:00:: upon her heart|heart%1:09:00:: whenever Dorothy's 
merry|merry%3:00:02:joyous:00 voice|voice%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: her ears; and she still|still%4:02:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: that she could find|find%2:40:02:: anything to laugh|laugh%1:10:00:: at. 
 
Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: laughed. He worked|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: from morning|morning%1:28:00:: till night|night%1:28:00:: and 
did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: what joy|joy%1:12:00:: was. He was|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:old:02 also, from his long|long%3:00:01:: beard|beard%1:08:00:: to 
his rough|rough%3:00:00:: boots, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: stern|stern%3:00:00:implacable:00 and solemn, and rarely|rarely%4:02:00:: spoke. 
 
It was|be%2:42:06:: Toto that made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy laugh, and saved|save%2:41:01:: her from growing|grow%2:30:00:: as 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as her other|other%3:00:00:: surroundings. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: gray; he was|be%2:42:03:: a little|little%3:00:01:: 
black|black%3:00:01:: dog, with long, silky|silky%3:00:00:bright:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and small|small%3:00:00:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that twinkled|twinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on either side|side%1:15:02:: of his funny, wee nose. Toto played|play%2:41:03:: all day|day%1:28:00:: 
long, and Dorothy played|play%2:41:03:: with him, and loved|love%2:37:00:: him dearly. 
 
 
 
To-day, however, they were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: playing. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: upon the 
door-step and looked|look%2:39:00:: anxiously|anxiously%4:02:00:: at the sky, which was|be%2:42:03:: even|even%4:02:00:: grayer|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 than 
usual. Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the door|door%1:06:01:: with Toto in her arms, and looked|look%2:39:00:: at 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: too. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: washing|wash%2:35:00:: the dishes. 
 
From the far|far%3:00:00:: north|north%1:24:00:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 wail|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, and Uncle|uncle%1:18:01:: 
Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: where the long|long%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: in waves|wave%1:11:01:: 
before the coming|come%2:30:01:: storm. There now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:30:01:: a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 whistling|whistling%1:11:00:: in the 
air|air%1:27:00:: from the south, and as they turned|turn%2:38:00:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that way|way%1:15:00:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: 
ripples|ripple%1:11:00:: in the grass|grass%1:20:00:: coming|come%2:38:00:: from that direction|direction%1:15:00:: also. 
 
Suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up. 
 
"There's a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: coming, Em," he called|call%2:32:09:: to his wife; "I'll go|go%2:38:00:: look|look%1:04:00:: 
after the stock." Then|then%4:02:00:: he ran|run%2:38:00:: toward the sheds|shed%1:06:00:: where the cows|cow%1:05:01:: and 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: kept. 
 
Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: dropped|drop%2:30:01:: her work|work%1:04:00:: and came|come%2:38:00:: to the door. One glance|glance%1:04:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: her of 
the danger|danger%1:26:00:: close|close%1:28:00:: at hand. 
 
"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed; "run for the cellar!" 
 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: out of Dorothy's arms|arm%1:08:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: under the bed, and the 
girl|girl%1:18:02:: started|start%2:30:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, badly|badly%4:02:02:: frightened, threw|throw%2:35:00:: open|open%3:00:01:: the 
trap-door in the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: into the small, 
dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. Dorothy caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto at last, and started|start%2:30:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: her 
aunt. When she was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%3:00:00:incomplete:00 way|way%1:15:00:: across the room|room%1:06:00:: there came|come%2:30:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 shriek|shriek%1:10:00:: 
from the wind, and the house|house%1:06:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:00:strong:00 that she lost|lose%2:40:02:: her footing|footing%1:26:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: upon the floor. 
 
A strange|strange%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: happened. 
 
The house|house%1:06:00:: whirled|whirl%2:38:01:: around two or three times|time%1:11:00:: and rose|rise%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: through 
the air. Dorothy felt|feel%2:29:00:: as if she were|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. 
 
The north|north%1:24:00:: and south|south%1:24:00:: winds|wind%1:19:00:: met|meet%2:42:02:: where the house|house%1:06:00:: stood, and made|make%2:36:00:: it the 
exact|exact%3:00:00:: center|center%1:15:01:: of the cyclone. In the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:26:00:: the air|air%1:27:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
generally|generally%4:02:02:: still, but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pressure|pressure%1:07:00:: of the wind|wind%1:19:00:: on every side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the house|house%1:06:00:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: it up|up%4:02:00:: higher|high%3:00:01:: and higher, until it was|be%2:42:03:: at the very|very%4:02:00:: 
top|top%1:15:00:: of the cyclone; and there it remained|remain%2:42:01:: and was|be%2:42:05:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: and 
miles|mile%1:23:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as you could carry|carry%2:35:02:: a feather. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: dark, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: howled|howl%2:32:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: around her, but 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:10:: she was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. After the first|first%3:00:00:: few|few%3:00:00:: whirls|whirl%1:25:00:: 
around, and one other|other%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: tipped|tip%2:40:00:: badly, she felt|feel%2:37:00:: as 
if she were|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: rocked|rock%2:38:00:: gently, like a baby|baby%1:18:00:: in a cradle. 
 
Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it. He ran|run%2:38:00:: about the room, now|now%4:02:05:: here, now|now%4:02:05:: there, 
barking|bark%2:32:00:: loudly; but Dorothy sat|sit%2:35:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: still|still%4:02:02:: on the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: 
to see|see%2:31:08:: what would happen. 
 
Once Toto got|get%2:30:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: near the open|open%3:00:01:: trap-door, and fell|fall%2:38:03:: in; and at first|first%3:00:00:: 
the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she had|have%2:39:06:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: him. But soon|soon%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: one of his 
ears|ear%1:08:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: through the hole, for the strong|strong%3:00:00:: pressure|pressure%1:19:00:: of the air|air%1:27:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: keeping|keep%2:42:00:: him up|up%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:06:: that he could not|not%4:02:00:: fall. She crept|creep%2:38:00:: to the hole, 
caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto by the ear, and dragged|drag%2:35:00:: him into the room|room%1:06:00:: again; afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: 
closing|close%2:35:00:: the trap-door so that no more|more%3:00:02:: accidents|accident%1:11:01:: could happen. 
 
Hour|hour%1:28:00:: after hour|hour%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: away, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: Dorothy got|get%2:30:00:: over her fright; 
but she felt|feel%2:37:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: lonely, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: shrieked|shriek%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: all about 
her that she nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: deaf. At first|first%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: if she 
would be|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:38:00:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:40:05:: again; but as the hours|hour%1:28:01:: 
passed|pass%2:38:03:: and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 happened, she stopped|stop%2:42:00:: worrying|worry%2:37:00:: and 
resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: calmly|calmly%4:02:00:: and see|see%2:31:08:: what the future|future%1:28:00:: would bring. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 
she crawled|crawl%2:38:00:: over the swaying|sway%2:38:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: to her bed, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon it; 
and Toto followed|follow%2:38:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside her. 
 
In spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the swaying of the house|house%1:06:00:: and the wailing|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, 
Dorothy soon|soon%4:02:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: asleep. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: II. 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by a shock, so|so%4:02:02:: sudden|sudden%3:00:00:: and severe|severe%3:00:00:strong:00 that if Dorothy 
had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: she might have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: hurt. As it 
was, the jar|jar%1:06:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: her catch|catch%2:40:00:: her breath|breath%1:27:00:: and wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: what had|have%2:40:00:: happened; 
and Toto put|put%2:35:00:: his cold|cold%3:00:02:: little|little%3:00:01:: nose|nose%1:08:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: and whined|whine%2:32:01:: dismally. 
Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: that the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: moving; nor was|be%2:42:03:: it 
dark, for the bright|bright%3:00:00:light:06 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: at the window, flooding|flood%2:35:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: room. She sprang|spring%2:38:01:: from her bed|bed%1:06:00:: and with Toto at her heels|heel%1:08:00:: ran|run%2:38:08:: 
and opened|open%2:35:00:: the door. 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a cry|cry%1:10:00:: of amazement|amazement%1:12:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: about her, her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: and bigger|big%3:00:01:: at the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sights|sight%1:10:00:: she saw. 
 
The cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: down, very|very%4:02:00:: gently--for a cyclone--in 
the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a country|country%1:15:00:: of marvelous|marvelous%3:00:00:incredible:00 beauty. There were|be%2:42:04:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 patches|patch%1:06:00:: 
of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sward|sward%1:17:00:: all about, with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 trees|tree%1:20:00:: bearing|bear%2:36:00:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and 
luscious|luscious%3:00:00:sexy:00 fruits. Banks|bank%1:17:00:: of gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: on every hand, and 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: with rare|rare%3:00:00:scarce:00 and brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 plumage|plumage%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: and fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: in the trees|tree%1:20:00:: 
and bushes. A|a%1:08:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: was|be%2:42:04:: a small|small%3:00:00:: brook, rushing|rush%2:30:00:: and sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 
along between green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 banks, and murmuring|murmur%2:32:00:: in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to 
a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: on the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairies. 
 
While she stood|stand%2:35:00:: looking|look%2:39:00:: eagerly|eagerly%4:02:00:: at the strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: sights, 
she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: coming|come%2:38:00:: toward her a group|group%1:03:00:: of the queerest|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 people|people%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: seen. They were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as the grown|grown%3:00:00:mature:01 folk|folk%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
used|use%2:34:02:: to; but neither were|be%2:42:03:: they very|very%4:02:00:: small. In fact, they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: about 
as|as%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: as Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: a well-grown child|child%1:18:00:: for her age, although 
they were, so|so%4:02:07:: far|far%4:02:00:: as looks|look%1:07:00:: go, many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: older. 
 
 
 
Three were|be%2:42:03:: men|man%1:18:00:: and one a woman, and all were|be%2:42:03:: oddly|oddly%4:02:00:: dressed. They wore|wear%2:29:00:: 
round|round%1:04:03:: hats|hat%1:06:00:: that rose|rise%2:38:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: point|point%1:25:00:: a foot|foot%1:23:00:: above their heads, with 
little|little%3:00:01:: bells|bell%1:06:00:: around the brims|brim%1:06:00:: that tinkled|tinkle%2:39:00:: sweetly|sweetly%4:02:00:: as they moved. The 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: of the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: blue; the little|little%3:00:01:: woman's hat|hat%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: white, and she 
wore|wear%2:29:00:: a white|white%3:00:01:: gown|gown%1:06:00:: that hung|hang%2:35:00:: in plaits|plait%1:08:00:: from her shoulders; over it were|be%2:42:03:: 
sprinkled|sprinkle%2:35:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: stars|star%1:17:01:: that glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: like diamonds. The men|man%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in blue, of the same|same%3:00:02:: shade|shade%1:07:00:: as their hats, and wore|wear%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: 
polished|polished%3:00:00:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with a deep|deep%3:00:00:colorful:00 roll|roll%1:25:00:: of blue|blue%1:07:00:: at the tops. The men, Dorothy 
thought, were|be%2:42:03:: about as|as%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: as Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry, for two of them had|have%2:40:00:: beards. 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: doubtless much|much%3:00:00:: older: her face|face%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: 
with wrinkles, her hair|hair%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: white, and she walked|walk%2:38:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: stiffly. 
 
When these people|people%1:14:00:: drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the house|house%1:06:00:: where Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: in 
the doorway, they paused|pause%2:32:01:: and whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: among themselves, as if afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: farther. But the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to Dorothy, made|make%2:32:00:: 
a low|low%3:00:01:: bow|bow%1:10:01:: and said, in a sweet|sweet%3:00:00:melodious:00 voice, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: welcome, most|most%4:02:00:: noble|noble%3:00:01:: Sorceress, to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins. 
We are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for having|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and for setting|set%2:30:01:: our people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage." 
 
 
 
Dorothy listened|listen%2:39:00:: to this speech|speech%1:10:01:: with wonder. What could the little|little%3:00:01:: 
woman|woman%1:18:00:: possibly|possibly%4:02:00:: mean|mean%2:32:01:: by calling|call%2:32:02:: her a sorceress, and saying|say%2:32:00:: she 
had|have%2:41:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East? Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: an innocent, 
harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: by a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
from home; and she had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything in all her life. 
 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: expected|expect%2:32:00:: her to answer; so Dorothy 
said, with hesitation, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind; but there must be|be%2:42:00:: some mistake. I have|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:42:00:: 
anything." 
 
"Your house|house%1:06:00:: did, anyway," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, with a laugh; 
"and that is|be%2:42:06:: the same|same%3:00:02:: thing. See!" she continued, pointing|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:15:02:: of the house; "there are|be%2:42:04:: her two toes, still|still%4:02:01:: sticking|stick%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: from 
under a block|block%1:06:00:: of wood." 
 
Dorothy looked, and gave|give%2:41:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fright. There, indeed, just|just%4:02:01:: 
under the corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beam|beam%1:06:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: rested|rest%2:35:00:: on, two feet|foot%1:23:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out, shod in silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: with pointed|pointed%3:00:00:: toes. 
 
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clasping|clasp%2:35:00:: her hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: in 
dismay; "the house|house%1:06:00:: must have|have%2:29:02:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on her. What ever|ever%4:02:04:: shall we do?" 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to be|be%2:42:00:: done," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman, calmly. 
 
 
 
"But who was|be%2:42:06:: she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East, as I said," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "She has|have%2:40:00:: held|hold%2:42:00:: all the Munchkins in bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: for many|many%3:00:00:: 
years, making|make%2:36:00:: them slave|slave%1:18:00:: for her night|night%1:28:00:: and day. Now|now%1:28:00:: they are|be%2:42:03:: all set|set%1:14:00:: 
free, and are|be%2:42:03:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for the favour." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Munchkins?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in this land|land%1:15:02:: of the East, where the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:intense:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: ruled." 
 
"Are you a Munchkin?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but I am|be%2:42:06:: their friend, although I live|live%2:42:08:: in the land|land%1:15:01:: of the North. 
When they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: the Munchkins sent|send%2:38:01:: a swift|swift%1:05:00:: 
messenger|messenger%1:18:00:: to me, and I came|come%2:38:00:: at once. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North." 
 
"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy; "are you a real|real%3:00:00:: witch?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "But I am|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: witch, and 
the people|people%1:14:01:: love|love%2:37:01:: me. I am|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: who 
ruled|rule%2:41:00:: here, or I should have|have%2:41:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: myself." 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:01:: all witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: wicked," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%1:23:00:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at facing|face%2:32:00:: a real|real%3:00:00:: witch. 
 
"Oh, no; that is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake. There were|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: four witches|witch%1:18:03:: in all 
the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz, and two of them, those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:00:: and the 
South, are|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: witches. I know|know%2:31:02:: this is|be%2:42:03:: true, for I am|be%2:42:06:: one of them 
myself, and cannot be|be%2:42:03:: mistaken. Those who dwelt|dwell%2:42:00:: in the East|east%1:15:00:: and the 
West|west%1:15:01:: were, indeed, wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witches; but now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: one 
of them, there is|be%2:42:00:: but one wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz--the one|one%1:23:00:: 
who lives|live%2:42:06:: in the West." 
 
"But," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em|em%1:23:01:: has|have%2:40:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: me 
that the witches|witch%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all dead--years and years|year%1:28:01:: ago." 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em?" inquired|inquire%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman. 
 
"She is|be%2:42:06:: my aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: who lives|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, where I came|come%2:42:09:: from." 
 
The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: for a time, with her head|head%1:08:00:: 
bowed|bow%2:38:00:: and her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: upon the ground. Then|then%4:02:00:: she looked|look%2:39:00:: up and said, 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: where Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: is, for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: that country|country%1:15:00:: 
mentioned|mention%2:32:00:: before. But tell|tell%2:32:00:: me, is|be%2:42:03:: it a civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: country?" 
 
"Oh, yes;" replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then that accounts|account%2:42:01:: for it. In|in%1:15:00:: the civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: countries|country%1:14:00:: I believe|believe%2:31:04:: 
there are|be%2:42:00:: no witches|witch%1:18:00:: left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor 
magicians. But, you see, the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz has|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: civilized, for 
we are|be%2:42:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: from all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the world. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: we still|still%4:02:01:: 
have|have%2:32:00:: witches|witch%1:18:00:: and wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: amongst us." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Wizards?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oz himself is|be%2:42:06:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Witch, sinking|sink%2:38:02:: her 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: to a whisper. "He is|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: than all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of us 
together. He lives|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:02:: another question, but just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: the Munchkins, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: by, gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: shout|shout%1:10:00:: and pointed|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:06:00:: of the house|house%1:06:00:: where the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying. 
 
 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman; and looked, and began|begin%2:30:01:: 
to laugh. The feet|foot%1:08:01:: of the dead|dead%3:00:01:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: disappeared|disappear%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: and 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:42:03:: but the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: old," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North, "that she dried|dry%2:30:01:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: quickly|quickly%4:02:00:: in the sun. That is|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of her. But the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: yours, and you shall have|have%2:40:00:: them to wear." She reached|reach%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and 
picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the shoes, and after shaking|shake%2:38:00:: the dust|dust%1:27:00:: out of them handed|hand%2:40:00:: 
them to Dorothy. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of those silver|silver%3:00:00:metallic:00 shoes," said|say%2:32:00:: one of 
the Munchkins; "and there is|be%2:42:03:: some charm|charm%1:07:00:: connected|connect%2:31:00:: with them; but what 
it is|be%2:42:06:: we never|never%4:02:00:: knew." 
 
Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: into the house|house%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: them on the 
table. Then|then%4:02:00:: she came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: to the Munchkins and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: and Uncle, for I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they 
will worry|worry%2:37:00:: about me. Can you help|help%2:41:00:: me find|find%2:40:00:: my way?" 
 
The Munchkins and the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: first|first%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at one another, and then|then%4:02:00:: at 
Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads. 
 
"At the East, not|not%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from here," said|say%2:32:00:: one, "there is|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert, 
and none|none%1:28:00:: could live|live%2:42:04:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the South," said|say%2:32:00:: another, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there 
and seen|see%2:39:02:: it. The South|south%1:15:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings." 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: told," said|say%2:32:00:: the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 man, "that it is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the West. And 
that country, where the Winkies live, is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the West, who would make|make%2:30:00:: you her slave|slave%1:18:00:: if you passed|pass%2:38:05:: her way." 
 
"The North|north%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my home," said|say%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: lady, "and at its edge|edge%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: the 
same|same%3:00:02:: great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert|desert%1:15:00:: that surrounds|surround%2:35:00:: this land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: I'm afraid, my 
dear, you will have|have%2:39:06:: to live|live%2:42:08:: with us." 
 
Dorothy began|begin%2:30:00:: to sob, at this, for she felt|feel%2:37:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 among all 
these strange|strange%3:00:00:: people. Her tears|tear%1:08:01:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to grieve|grieve%2:37:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 
Munchkins, for they immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: their handkerchiefs|handkerchief%1:06:00:: and 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep also. As for the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her 
cap|cap%1:06:00:: and balanced|balance%2:35:00:: the point|point%1:25:00:: on the end|end%1:15:00:: of her nose, while she counted|count%2:32:00:: 
"one, two, three" in a solemn|solemn%3:00:00:serious:00 voice. At once|once%4:02:02:: the cap|cap%1:06:00:: changed|change%2:30:00:: to a 
slate, on which was|be%2:42:05:: written|write%2:36:01:: in big, white|white%3:00:01:: chalk|chalk%1:06:00:: marks: 
 
"LET DOROTHY GO|go%1:06:00:: TO THE CITY|city%1:15:00:: OF EMERALDS." 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: the slate|slate%1:06:00:: from her nose, and, having|have%2:40:00:: read|read%2:31:00:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: on it, asked, 
 
"Is your name|name%1:10:00:: Dorothy, my dear?" 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child, looking|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:01:: her tears. 
 
"Then you must go|go%2:38:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: this City?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:05:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the center|center%1:15:01:: of the country, and is|be%2:42:05:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by Oz, the 
Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: I told|tell%2:32:01:: you of." 
 
"Is he a good|good%3:00:01:: man?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"He is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Wizard. Whether he is|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: or not|not%4:02:00:: I cannot tell, for I 
have|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: there?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"You must walk. It is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, through a country|country%1:15:02:: that is|be%2:42:03:: 
sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: dark|dark%3:00:00:evil:00 and terrible. However, I will 
use|use%2:34:01:: all the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: I know|know%2:31:03:: of to keep|keep%2:41:01:: you from harm." 
 
"Won't you go|go%2:38:00:: with me?" pleaded|plead%2:32:00:: the girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon 
the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: as her only|only%3:00:00:single:05 friend. 
 
"No, I cannot do|do%2:36:01:: that," she replied; "but I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my kiss, 
and no one will|will%1:09:01:: dare injure|injure%2:29:00:: a person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: by the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
of the North." 
 
She came|come%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy and kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:01:: on the forehead. 
Where her lips|lip%1:08:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:02:: they left|leave%2:42:00:: a round, shining|shin%2:38:00:: mark, as 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:02:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds|emerald%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Witch; "so you cannot miss|miss%2:39:00:: it. When you get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of 
him, but tell|tell%2:32:01:: your story|story%1:10:03:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to help|help%2:41:00:: you. Good-bye, my dear." 
 
 
 
The three Munchkins bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to her and wished|wish%2:32:00:: her a pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: 
journey, after which they walked|walk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: through the trees. The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
gave|give%2:40:07:: Dorothy a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: nod, whirled|whirl%2:38:04:: around|around%4:02:09:: on her left|leave%2:38:01:: heel|heel%1:06:02:: 
three times, and straightway disappeared, much|much%3:00:00:: to the surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: of 
little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, who barked|bark%2:32:01:: after her loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: gone, 
because he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: to growl|growl%2:32:00:: while she stood|stand%2:35:00:: by. 
 
But Dorothy, knowing|know%2:31:01:: her to be|be%2:42:06:: a witch, had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: her to disappear|disappear%2:30:00:: 
in just|just%4:02:05:: that way, and was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: in the least. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: III. 
 
 
When Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:30:02:: alone|alone%4:02:01:: she began|begin%2:30:00:: to feel|feel%2:29:00:: hungry. So she went|go%2:38:00:: 
to the cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: herself some bread, which she spread|spread%2:42:00:: with 
butter. She gave|give%2:40:00:: some to Toto, and taking|take%2:35:00:: a pail|pail%1:06:00:: from the shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: 
she carried|carry%2:35:02:: it down|down%4:02:00:: to the little|little%3:00:01:: brook|brook%1:17:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with clear, 
sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:: water. Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark|bark%2:32:00:: at the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: there. Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him, and saw|saw%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 
fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: hanging|hanging%1:04:01:: from the branches|branch%1:20:00:: that she gathered|gather%2:35:00:: some of it, finding|finding%1:04:00:: 
it just|just%4:02:00:: what she wanted|want%2:37:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: her breakfast. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the house, and having|have%2:41:00:: helped|help%2:34:00:: herself and Toto 
to a good|good%3:00:01:: drink|drink%1:04:01:: of the cool, clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, she set|set%2:30:01:: about making|make%2:30:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: 
for the journey|journey%1:04:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. 
 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one other|other%3:00:00:: dress, but that happened|happen%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: and 
was|be%2:42:03:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: on a peg|peg%2:35:00:: beside her bed. It was|be%2:42:03:: gingham, with checks|check%1:21:00:: 
of white|white%3:00:01:: and blue; and although the blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: somewhat|somewhat%4:02:01:: faded|fade%2:30:01:: with 
many|many%3:00:00:: washings, it was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frock. The girl|girl%1:18:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: herself 
carefully, dressed|dress%2:29:00:: herself in the clean|clean%3:00:01:: gingham, and tied|tie%2:35:00:: her pink|pink%1:07:00:: 
sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: on her head. She took|take%2:40:05:: a little|little%3:00:01:: basket|basket%1:06:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with 
bread|bread%1:13:00:: from the cupboard, laying|lay%2:35:01:: a white|white%3:00:01:: cloth|cloth%1:06:00:: over the top. Then|then%4:02:00:: she 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at her feet|foot%1:08:01:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: how old|old%3:00:02:: and worn|wear%2:30:00:: her shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: were. 
 
"They surely|surely%4:02:00:: will never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, Toto," she said. And 
Toto looked|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: with his little|little%3:00:01:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and wagged|wag%2:38:00:: 
his tail|tail%1:05:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: he knew|know%2:31:03:: what she meant. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: on the table|table%1:06:01:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that 
had|have%2:42:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East. 
 
"I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if they will fit|fit%2:30:01:: me," she said|say%2:32:00:: to Toto. "They would be|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:01:: 
the thing|thing%1:26:00:: to take|take%2:39:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: in, for they could not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:03:: out." 
 
She took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her old|old%3:00:01:: leather|leather%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and tried|try%2:29:00:: on the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 ones, 
which fitted|fit%2:42:05:: her as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as if they had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for her. 
 
Finally|finally%4:02:02:: she picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket. 
 
"Come along, Toto," she said, "we will go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz how to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again." 
 
She closed|close%2:35:00:: the door, locked|lock%2:35:00:: it, and put|put%2:35:00:: the key|key%1:06:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in the 
pocket|pocket%1:06:00:: of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting|trot%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: soberly|soberly%4:02:00:: behind 
her, she started|start%2:30:01:: on her journey. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 roads|road%1:06:00:: near by, but it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:40:06:: her long|long%3:00:02:: to 
find|find%2:40:01:: the one|one%1:23:00:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. Within a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: she was|be%2:42:03:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: briskly|briskly%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald City, her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: tinkling|tinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on the hard, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 roadbed. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: and the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 and Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:37:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: as you might 
think|think%2:31:01:: a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: would who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: whisked|whisk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from her 
own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 country|country%1:15:00:: and set|set%2:36:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: surprised, as she walked|walk%2:38:00:: along, to see|see%2:39:00:: how pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: about her. There were|be%2:42:04:: neat|neat%3:00:00:tidy:00 fences|fence%1:06:00:: at the sides|side%1:15:02:: of the road, 
painted|paint%2:35:00:: a dainty|dainty%3:00:00:delicate:00 blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color, and beyond them were|be%2:42:04:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of grain|grain%1:20:00:: and 
vegetables|vegetable%1:20:00:: in abundance. Evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: the Munchkins were|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: farmers|farmer%1:18:00:: 
and able|able%3:00:00:: to raise|raise%2:36:03:: large|large%3:00:00:: crops. Once|once%4:02:00:: in a while|while%1:28:00:: she would pass|pass%2:30:11:: a 
house, and the people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to look|look%2:39:00:: at her and bow|bow%2:38:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: as she 
went|go%2:38:00:: by; for everyone knew|know%2:31:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: the means|mean%1:09:00:: of destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch|witch%1:18:01:: and setting|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage. The houses|house%1:06:00:: of the 
Munchkins were|be%2:42:06:: odd|odd%3:00:00:strange:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: dwellings, for each was|be%2:42:03:: round, with a big|big%3:00:01:: 
dome|dome%1:06:00:: for a roof. All were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: blue, for in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the 
East|east%3:00:00:: blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:popular:00 color. 
 
Towards evening, when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: with her long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: 
to wonder|wonder%2:32:01:: where she should pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night, she came|come%2:38:04:: to a house|house%1:06:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: 
larger|large%3:00:00:: than the rest. On the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lawn|lawn%1:15:00:: before it many|many%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: and women|woman%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dancing. Five little|little%3:00:01:: fiddlers|fiddler%1:18:00:: played|play%2:36:12:: as|as%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: as possible|possible%3:00:00:: and 
the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: laughing|laughing%3:00:00:happy:00 and singing, while a big|big%3:00:01:: table|table%1:06:01:: near by was|be%2:42:03:: 
loaded|load%2:35:01:: with delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits|fruit%1:20:00:: and nuts, pies|pie%1:13:00:: and cakes, and many|many%3:00:00:: other|other%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat. 
 
The people|people%1:14:00:: greeted|greet%2:32:00:: Dorothy kindly, and invited|invite%2:41:00:: her to supper|supper%1:13:00:: and to 
pass|pass%2:41:11:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with them; for this was|be%2:42:06:: the home|home%1:15:04:: of one of the richest|rich%3:00:00:: 
Munchkins in the land, and his friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gathered|gather%2:41:00:: with him to 
celebrate|celebrate%2:41:00:: their freedom|freedom%1:26:00:: from the bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witch. 
 
Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:00:wholesome:00 supper|supper%1:13:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: waited|wait%2:31:00:: upon by the rich|rich%3:00:00:: Munchkin 
himself, whose name|name%1:10:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: Boq. Then|then%4:02:00:: she sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon a settee|settee%1:06:00:: and 
watched|watch%2:39:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: dance. 
 
When Boq saw|saw%2:35:00:: her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he said, 
 
"You must be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 sorceress." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Because you wear|wear%2:29:00:: silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch. 
Besides, you have|have%2:40:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: in your frock, and only|only%3:00:00:single:05 witches|witch%1:18:03:: and 
sorceresses|sorceress%1:18:00:: wear|wear%2:29:00:: white." 
 
 
 
"My dress|dress%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: checked," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, smoothing|smooth%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the 
wrinkles|wrinkle%1:25:00:: in it. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to wear|wear%2:29:00:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Boq. "Blue is|be%2:42:06:: the color|color%1:07:00:: of 
the Munchkins, and white|white%3:00:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the witch|witch%1:18:01:: color; so we know|know%2:31:02:: you are|be%2:42:06:: a 
friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: witch." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: what to say|say%2:32:00:: to this, for all the people|people%1:14:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
to think|think%2:31:01:: her a witch, and she knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: an ordinary|ordinary%3:00:02:common:01 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: by the chance|chance%1:19:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: into a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
When she had|have%2:39:06:: tired|tire%2:29:00:: watching|watch%2:39:05:: the dancing, Boq led|lead%2:38:01:: her into the house, 
where he gave|give%2:40:00:: her a room|room%1:06:00:: with a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 bed|bed%1:06:00:: in it. The sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
made|make%2:42:05:: of blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cloth, and Dorothy slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: in them till morning, 
with Toto curled|curl%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: on the blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rug|rug%1:06:00:: beside her. 
 
She ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 breakfast, and watched|watch%2:39:05:: a wee Munchkin baby, who 
played|play%2:41:03:: with Toto and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: and crowed|crow%2:32:02:: and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: in a way|way%1:07:01:: 
that greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: amused|amuse%2:41:00:: Dorothy. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 curiosity|curiosity%1:09:00:: to all the 
people, for they had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:38:00:: a dog|dog%1:05:00:: before. 
 
"How far|far%4:02:04:: is|be%2:42:03:: it to the Emerald City?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked. 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Boq, gravely, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there. 
It is|be%2:42:03:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 for people|people%1:14:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Oz, unless they have|have%2:40:00:: 
business|business%1:04:00:: with him. But it is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: way|way%1:06:00:: to the Emerald City, and it 
will take|take%2:40:06:: you many|many%3:00:00:: days. The country|country%1:15:01:: here|here%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and pleasant, but 
you must pass|pass%2:38:00:: through rough|rough%3:00:00:: and dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: places|place%1:15:00:: before you reach|reach%2:38:00:: the 
end|end%1:11:00:: of your journey." 
 
This worried|worried%3:00:00:troubled:00 Dorothy a little, but she knew|know%2:31:02:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz 
could help|help%2:41:00:: her get|get%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again, so she bravely|bravely%4:02:00:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
turn|turn%2:38:00:: back. 
 
She bade|bid%2:32:01:: her friends|friend%1:18:00:: good-bye, and again|again%4:02:00:: started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: of 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. When she had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 miles|mile%1:23:01:: she thought|think%2:31:03:: she would 
stop|stop%2:38:00:: to rest, and so|so%4:02:05:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the fence|fence%1:06:00:: beside the road|road%1:06:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down. There was|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: beyond the fence, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
far|far%4:02:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: a Scarecrow, placed|place%2:35:00:: high|high%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: the birds|bird%1:05:00:: 
from the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: corn. 
 
Dorothy leaned|lean%2:38:00:: her chin|chin%1:08:00:: upon her hand|hand%1:08:00:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow. Its head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a small|small%3:00:00:: sack|sack%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, with eyes, 
nose|nose%1:06:01:: and mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: on it to represent|represent%2:32:02:: a face. An old, pointed|point%2:32:00:: 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hat, that had|have%2:40:00:: belonged|belong%2:42:06:: to some Munchkin, was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: on this 
head, and the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the figure|figure%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 suit|suit%1:06:00:: of clothes, worn|wear%2:30:00:: and 
faded, which had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. On the feet|foot%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:04:: some 
old|old%3:00:01:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tops, such|such%3:00:00:much:00 as every man|man%1:18:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: in this country, and 
the figure|figure%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: above the stalks|stalk%1:20:00:: of corn|corn%1:20:00:: by means|mean%1:09:00:: of the pole|pole%1:06:00:: 
stuck|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: its back. 
 
 
 
While Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: looking|look%2:39:00:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: into the queer, painted|paint%2:35:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: of 
the Scarecrow, she was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: one of the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: wink|wink%2:39:00:: 
at her. She thought|think%2:31:03:: she must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: mistaken, at first, for none|none%1:04:00:: of 
the scarecrows|scarecrow%1:06:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: wink; but presently|presently%4:02:00:: the figure|figure%1:08:00:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: its 
head|head%1:08:00:: to her in a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: way. Then|then%4:02:00:: she climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from the fence|fence%1:06:00:: and 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to it, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around the pole|pole%1:06:00:: and barked. 
 
"Good day," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a rather|rather%4:02:04:: husky|husky%3:00:00:robust:00 voice. 
 
"Did you speak?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, in wonder. 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you do?" 
 
"I'm pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 well, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, politely; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you 
do?" 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: feeling|feel%2:29:00:: well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: tedious|tedious%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 being|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day|day%1:28:02:: to scare|scare%2:37:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: crows." 
 
"Can't you get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No, for this pole|pole%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: up|up%4:02:00:: my back. If you will please|please%2:37:01:: take|take%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: 
the pole|pole%1:06:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to you." 
 
Dorothy reached|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: both arms|arm%1:08:00:: and lifted|lift%2:38:00:: the figure|figure%1:25:00:: off the pole; for, 
being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: light. 
 
"Thank you very|very%4:02:01:: much," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: set|set%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the ground. "I feel|feel%2:29:00:: like a new|new%3:00:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: at this, for it sounded|sound%2:39:06:: queer|queer%1:18:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: 
man|man%1:18:00:: speak, and to see|see%2:39:00:: him bow|bow%2:38:00:: and walk|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside her. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: himself and 
yawned, "and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" 
 
"My name|name%1:10:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: 
City, to ask|ask%2:32:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: the Emerald City?" he enquired; "and who is|be%2:42:06:: Oz?" 
 
"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise. 
 
"No, indeed; I|i%1:27:00:: don't know|know%2:31:01:: anything. You see, I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, so I have|have%2:40:00:: 
no brains|brain%1:09:00:: at all," he answered, sadly. 
 
 
 
"Oh," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "I'm awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: for you." 
 
"Do you think," he asked, "If I go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City|city%1:15:00:: with you, that 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz would give|give%2:40:03:: me some brains?" 
 
"I cannot tell," she returned; "but you may come|come%2:38:00:: with me, if you 
like. If Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you any brains|brain%1:09:00:: you will be|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off 
than you are|be%2:42:06:: now." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued, 
confidentially, "I don't mind|mind%2:32:00:: my legs|leg%1:08:01:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and body|body%1:08:01:: being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, 
because I cannot get|get%2:30:00:: hurt. If anyone treads|tread%2:38:01:: on my toes|toe%1:08:01:: or sticks|stick%2:35:01:: a 
pin|pin%1:06:06:: into me, it doesn't matter, for I|i%1:27:00:: cant|cant%1:10:01:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it. But I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: to call|call%2:32:00:: me a fool, and if my head|head%1:08:00:: stays|stay%1:04:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw|straw%1:27:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:00:: of with brains, as yours is, how am|be%2:42:03:: I ever|ever%4:02:04:: to know|know%2:31:01:: anything?" 
 
"I understand|understand%2:31:00:: how you feel," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: 
sorry for him. "If you will come|come%2:38:00:: with me I'll ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to do|do%2:41:01:: all he can 
for you." 
 
"Thank you," he answered, gratefully. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, Dorothy helped|help%2:41:00:: him over the fence, and 
they started|start%2:38:02:: along the path|path%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
Toto did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: this addition|addition%1:06:00:: to the party, at first. He smelled|smell%2:39:03:: 
around the stuffed|stuff%2:30:02:: man|man%1:18:00:: as if he suspected|suspect%2:32:00:: there might be|be%2:42:00:: a nest|nest%1:17:00:: of 
rats|rat%1:05:00:: in the straw, and he often|often%4:02:00:: growled|growl%2:32:00:: in an unfriendly|unfriendly%3:00:01:: way|way%1:07:01:: at the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"Don't mind|mind%1:09:00:: Toto," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, to her new|new%3:00:00:: friend; "he never|never%4:02:00:: bites." 
 
"Oh, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: afraid," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "he can't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
straw. Do|do%1:10:01:: let|let%2:41:00:: me carry|carry%2:35:02:: that basket|basket%1:06:00:: for you. I shall not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: it, 
for I can't get|get%2:30:00:: tired. I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you a secret," he continued, as he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along; "there is|be%2:42:04:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:06:01:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "the Munchkin farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: who made|make%2:36:01:: you?" 
 
"No," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted|light%2:43:00:: match." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IV. 
 
 
After a few|few%3:00:00:: hours|hour%1:28:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: rough, and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
difficult|difficult%3:00:00:: that the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: often|often%4:02:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: over the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: here|here%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: or 
missing|miss%2:42:00:: altogether, leaving|leave%2:42:00:: holes|hole%1:17:01:: that Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: across and Dorothy 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: around. As for the Scarecrow, having|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%3:00:01:: ahead, and so|so%4:02:05:: stepped|step%2:38:00:: into the holes|hole%1:06:00:: and fell|fall%2:38:03:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length|length%1:07:00:: 
on the hard|hard%3:00:01:: bricks. It never|never%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: him, however, and Dorothy would 
pick|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet|foot%1:08:01:: again, while he joined|join%2:41:00:: her in 
laughing|laugh%2:29:00:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: at his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mishap. 
 
 
 
The farms|farm%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: cared|care%2:41:13:: for here|here%4:02:00:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: farther|far%4:02:00:: 
back. There were|be%2:42:00:: fewer|few%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees, and the farther|far%4:02:00:: 
they went|go%2:38:01:: the more|more%4:02:00:: dismal|dismal%3:00:00:depressing:00 and lonesome|lonesome%3:00:00:dejected:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: became. 
 
At noon|noon%1:28:00:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the roadside, near a little|little%3:00:01:: brook, and 
Dorothy opened|open%2:35:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and got|get%2:35:03:: out|out%4:02:04:: some bread. She offered|offer%2:40:00:: a piece|piece%1:21:00:: 
to the Scarecrow, but he refused. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: hungry," he said; "and it is|be%2:42:03:: a lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: not. For 
my mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: painted, and if I should cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:06:00:: in it so I could 
eat, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with would come|come%2:38:00:: out, and that would spoil|spoil%2:30:01:: 
the shape|shape%1:07:00:: of my head." 
 
Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: that this was|be%2:42:03:: true, so she only|only%4:02:02:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: and went|go%2:38:01:: 
on eating|eat%2:34:00:: her bread. 
 
"Tell me something about yourself, and the country|country%1:15:00:: you came|come%2:42:09:: from," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: her dinner. So she told|tell%2:32:01:: 
him all about Kansas, and how gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 everything was|be%2:42:03:: there, and how 
the cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: her to this queer|queer%1:18:00:: land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
listened|listen%2:39:00:: carefully, and said, 
 
"I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: why you should wish|wish%2:37:02:: to leave|leave%2:31:05:: this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
country|country%1:15:01:: and go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 place|place%1:15:00:: you call|call%2:32:02:: Kansas." 
 
 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: because you have|have%2:40:00:: no brains," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. "No matter|matter%1:09:00:: 
how dreary|dreary%3:00:00:dull:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 our homes|home%1:06:00:: are, we people|people%1:14:00:: of flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: and blood|blood%1:08:00:: 
would rather|rather%4:02:01:: live|live%2:42:08:: there|there%4:02:00:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: country, be|be%2:42:03:: it ever|ever%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
beautiful. There is|be%2:42:00:: no place|place%1:15:00:: like home." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sighed. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: it," he said. "If your heads|head%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: with straw, like mine, you would probably|probably%4:02:00:: all live|live%2:42:08:: in the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: places, and then|then%4:02:00:: Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: would have|have%2:40:00:: no people|people%1:14:00:: at all. It is|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: for Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: brains." 
 
"Won't you tell|tell%2:32:01:: me a story, while we are|be%2:42:03:: resting?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her reproachfully, and answered, 
 
"My life|life%1:26:02:: has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: short|short%3:00:02:: that I really|really%4:02:04:: know|know%2:31:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: whatever. I was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: made|make%2:36:08:: day|day%1:28:00:: before yesterday. What happened|happen%2:30:00:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: before 
that time|time%1:28:05:: is|be%2:42:03:: all|all%4:02:00:: unknown|unknown%3:00:00:: to me. Luckily, when the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: my 
head, one of the first|first%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:04:00:: he did|do%2:41:01:: was|be%2:42:06:: to paint|paint%2:35:00:: my ears, so that I 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: what was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: on. There was|be%2:42:04:: another Munchkin with him, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: I heard|hear%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: saying, 
 
"'How do|do%2:41:01:: you like|like%2:37:05:: those ears?' 
 
"'They aren't straight,' answered|answer%2:32:00:: the other. 
 
"'Never mind,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'they are|be%2:42:06:: ears|ear%1:08:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same,' which 
was|be%2:42:03:: true|true%3:00:00:: enough. 
 
"'Now I'll make|make%2:36:00:: the eyes,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer. So he painted|paint%2:35:00:: my right|right%1:15:00:: 
eye, and as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: I found|find%2:39:02:: myself looking|look%2:39:00:: at him and 
at everything around me with a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of curiosity, for this was|be%2:42:06:: 
my first|first%3:00:00:: glimpse|glimpse%1:04:00:: of the world. 
 
"'That's a rather|rather%4:02:04:: pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 eye,' remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Munchkin who was|be%2:42:06:: watching|watch%2:41:00:: 
the farmer; 'blue paint|paint%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:00:: the color|color%1:07:00:: for eyes.' 
 
"'I think|think%1:09:00:: I'll make|make%2:30:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: bigger,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; and 
when the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 eye|eye%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: done|do%2:41:01:: I could see|see%2:39:00:: much|much%4:02:00:: better|better%3:00:02:: than before. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: my nose|nose%1:08:00:: and my mouth; but I did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: speak, because 
at that time|time%1:28:00:: I didn't know|know%2:31:03:: what a mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: for. I had|have%2:40:00:: the fun|fun%1:04:00:: of 
watching|watch%2:39:00:: them make|make%2:36:11:: my body|body%1:08:00:: and my arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs; and when they 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: on my head, at last, I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud, for I thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: 
just|just%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as anyone. 
 
"'This fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: will scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows|crow%1:05:00:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: enough,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: like a man.' 
 
"'Why, he is|be%2:42:03:: a man,' said|say%2:32:00:: the other, and I quite|quite%4:02:01:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. The 
farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: me under his arm|arm%1:08:00:: to the cornfield, and set|set%2:35:00:: me up|up%4:02:00:: on a 
tall|tall%3:00:00:: stick, where you found|find%2:40:00:: me. He and his friend|friend%1:18:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after|after%4:02:01:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
away|away%4:02:03:: and left|leave%2:30:02:: me alone. 
 
"I did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: deserted|desert%2:31:00:: this way; so I tried|try%2:41:00:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: after 
them, but my feet|foot%1:08:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the ground, and I was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:36:00:: to 
stay|stay%2:30:00:: on that pole. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 life|life%1:26:01:: to lead, for I had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to 
think|think%2:36:00:: of, having|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:00:: made|make%2:36:08:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: while before. Many|many%3:00:00:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the cornfield, but as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they saw|saw%2:35:00:: me they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again, thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: I was|be%2:42:06:: a Munchkin; and this pleased|please%2:37:00:: me and 
made|make%2:30:00:: me feel|feel%2:31:01:: that I was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: an important|important%3:00:00:: person. By and by an old|old%3:00:02:: 
crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: near me, and after looking|look%2:39:00:: at me carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: he perched|perch%2:38:00:: upon 
my shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
 
 
"'I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if that farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: thought|think%2:31:06:: to fool|fool%2:41:00:: me in this clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 manner. 
Any crow|crow%1:05:00:: of sense|sense%1:09:04:: could see|see%2:31:01:: that you are|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw.' 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he hopped|hop%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at my feet|foot%1:08:01:: and ate|eat%2:34:00:: all the corn|corn%1:20:00:: he wanted. The 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds, seeing|see%2:31:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: harmed|harm%2:29:00:: by me, came|come%2:38:04:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: the corn|corn%1:20:00:: 
too, so|so%4:02:05:: in a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of them about me." 
 
"I felt|feel%2:37:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: at this, for it showed|show%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a good|good%3:00:01:: Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
after all; but the old|old%3:00:02:: crow|crow%1:05:00:: comforted|comfort%2:37:01:: me, saying: 'If you only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head|head%1:08:00:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any of them, and a 
better|better%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: than some of them. Brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 things|thing%1:09:00:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 having|have%2:40:00:: 
in this world, no matter|matter%1:09:01:: whether one is|be%2:42:06:: a crow|crow%1:05:00:: or a man.' 
 
"After the crows|crow%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:01:: I thought|think%2:31:00:: this over, and decided|decide%2:31:00:: I would 
try|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: some brains. By good|good%3:00:01:: luck, you came|come%2:38:04:: along|along%4:02:00:: and pulled|pull%2:41:00:: 
me off the stake, and from what you say|say%2:32:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%4:02:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz will 
give|give%2:40:00:: me brains|brain%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as we get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"I hope|hope%1:12:01:: so," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly, "since you seem|seem%2:39:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to have|have%2:40:00:: 
them." 
 
"Oh yes; I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "It is|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an 
uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: feeling|feeling%1:26:00:: to know|know%2:31:02:: one is|be%2:42:03:: a fool." 
 
 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "let us go." And she handed|hand%2:40:00:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: to the 
Scarecrow. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: no fences|fence%1:06:00:: at all by the road|road%1:06:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: now, and the land|land%1:21:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
rough|rough%3:00:00:: and untilled. Towards evening|evening%1:28:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and close|close%3:00:05:: together|together%4:02:02:: that their branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: over the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. It was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: dark|dark%3:00:01:: under the 
trees, for the branches|branch%1:20:00:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the daylight; but the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: stop, and went|go%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: into the forest. 
 
"If this road|road%1:06:00:: goes|go%2:42:00:: in, it must come|come%2:38:00:: out," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and as 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: at the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: of the road, we must go|go%2:38:00:: wherever 
it leads|lead%2:38:01:: us." 
 
"Anyone would know|know%2:31:01:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Certainly; that is|be%2:42:06:: why I know|know%2:31:00:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "If it 
required|require%2:42:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: to figure|figure%2:31:02:: it out, I never|never%4:02:00:: should have|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: it." 
 
After an hour|hour%1:28:00:: or so|so%4:02:05:: the light|light%1:19:00:: faded|fade%2:30:02:: away, and they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
stumbling|stumble%2:38:01:: along|along%4:02:01:: in the darkness. Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: at all, 
but Toto could, for some dogs|dog%1:05:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: in the dark; and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he could see|see%2:39:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as by day. So she took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his arm, and managed|manage%2:41:08:: to get|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: fairly|fairly%4:02:02:: well. 
 
"If you see|see%2:39:00:: any house, or any place|place%1:15:00:: where we can pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night," she 
said, "you must tell|tell%2:32:04:: me; for it is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: walking|walking%1:04:00:: in the 
dark." 
 
Soon|soon%4:02:00:: after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stopped. 
 
"I see|see%2:39:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: at the right|right%1:15:00:: of us," he said, "built of logs|log%1:27:01:: 
and branches. Shall we go|go%2:38:00:: there?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child. "I am|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tired%3:00:00:: out." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: her through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
cottage, and Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in one 
corner. She lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at once, and with Toto beside her soon|soon%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
into a sound|sound%3:00:00:reasonable:00 sleep. The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: tired, stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in 
another corner|corner%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: until morning|morning%1:28:00:: came. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: V. 
 
 
When Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: shining|shin%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and Toto 
had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: out|out%4:02:04:: chasing birds|bird%1:05:00:: and squirrels. She sat|sit%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:01:: 
around her. There was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, still|still%4:02:01:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: in his 
corner, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for her. 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: and search|search%2:35:00:: for water," she said|say%2:32:00:: to him. 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you want|want%2:37:00:: water?" he asked. 
 
"To wash|wash%2:29:00:: my face|face%1:08:00:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: after the dust|dust%1:27:00:: of the road, and to drink, so|so%4:02:09:: 
the dry|dry%3:00:01:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: will not|not%4:02:00:: stick|stick%2:38:00:: in my throat." 
 
"It must be|be%2:42:03:: inconvenient|inconvenient%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, 
thoughtfully; "for you must sleep, and eat|eat%2:34:00:: and drink. However, you 
have|have%2:40:00:: brains, and it is|be%2:42:03:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of bother|bother%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: 
properly." 
 
They left|leave%2:38:01:: the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they found|find%2:40:00:: a 
little|little%3:00:01:: spring|spring%1:17:00:: of clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, where Dorothy drank|drink%2:34:00:: and bathed|bath%2:29:00:: and ate|eat%2:34:01:: 
her breakfast. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: left|leave%2:42:03:: in the basket, 
and the girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: thankful|thankful%3:00:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: anything, 
for there was|be%2:42:00:: scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: for herself and Toto for the day. 
 
When she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:34:00:: her meal, and was|be%2:42:03:: about to go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, she was|be%2:42:03:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 groan|groan%1:10:00:: near by. 
 
"What was|be%2:42:06:: that?" she asked, timidly. 
 
"I cannot imagine," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but we can go|go%2:38:00:: and see." 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: then|then%4:02:00:: another groan|groan%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: their ears, and the sound|sound%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to 
come|come%2:38:00:: from behind them. They turned|turn%2:38:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a 
few|few%3:00:00:: steps, when Dorothy discovered|discover%2:39:03:: something shining|shin%2:38:00:: in a ray|ray%1:19:00:: of 
sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: that fell|fall%2:38:00:: between the trees. She ran|run%2:38:00:: to the place, and then|then%4:02:00:: 
stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, with a cry|cry%1:10:04:: of surprise. 
 
One of the big|big%3:00:01:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: partly|partly%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: through, and standing|standing%1:04:00:: 
beside it, with an uplifted|uplifted%3:00:00:elated:00 axe|axe%1:06:00:: in his hands, was|be%2:42:04:: a man|man%1:18:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: 
of tin. His head|head%1:08:00:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: jointed|joint%2:35:00:: upon his body, but he 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: motionless, as if he could not|not%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: at all. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in amazement, and so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: the Scarecrow, while 
Toto barked|bark%2:32:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: and made|make%2:41:00:: a snap|snap%1:04:00:: at the tin|tin%1:27:00:: legs, which hurt|hurt%2:39:00:: his 
teeth. 
 
"Did you groan?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the tin|tin%1:27:00:: man; "I did. I've been|be%2:42:03:: groaning|groan%2:32:00:: for more|more%3:00:01:: than 
a year, and no one|one%1:23:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: me before or come|come%2:38:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for you?" she enquired, softly, for she was|be%2:42:03:: moved|move%2:37:00:: by 
the sad|sad%3:00:00:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: in which the man|man%1:18:00:: spoke. 
 
 
 
"Get an oil-can and oil|oil%1:27:00:: my joints," he answered. "They are|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
badly|badly%4:02:02:: that I cannot move|move%2:38:01:: them at all; if I am|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: oiled|oil%2:35:00:: I shall soon|soon%4:02:00:: 
be|be%2:42:03:: all right|right%3:00:02:: again. You will find|find%2:40:02:: an oil-can on a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: in my cottage." 
 
Dorothy at once|once%4:02:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: the oil-can, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: she returned|return%2:38:00:: and asked, anxiously, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: your joints?" 
 
"Oil my neck, first," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. So she oiled|oil%2:35:00:: it, and 
as it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of the tin|tin%1:27:00:: head|head%1:06:00:: 
and moved|move%2:38:01:: it gently|gently%4:02:01:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: until it worked|work%2:35:02:: freely, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: could turn|turn%2:38:00:: it himself. 
 
"Now oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled|oil%2:35:00:: them and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: them carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: free|free%3:00:00:: from 
rust|rust%1:27:00:: and as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as new. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: gave|give%2:40:03:: a sigh|sigh%1:10:00:: of satisfaction|satisfaction%1:12:00:: and lowered|lower%2:38:00:: his axe, 
which he leaned|lean%2:35:00:: against the tree. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 comfort," he said. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:00:: that axe in 
the air|air%1:27:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: since I rusted, and I'm glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: it down|down%4:02:00:: 
at last. Now, if you will oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: of my legs, I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all 
right|right%4:02:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: more." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they oiled|oil%2:35:00:: his legs|leg%1:08:01:: until he could move|move%2:38:01:: them freely; and he 
thanked|thank%2:32:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: and again|again%4:02:00:: for his release, for he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
polite|polite%3:00:00:: creature, and very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 grateful. 
 
"I might have|have%2:41:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: there|there%4:02:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: if you had|have%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: along," he said; 
"so you have|have%2:40:00:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How did|do%2:41:01:: you happen|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:05:: here?" 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: on our way|way%1:04:02:: to the Emerald City, to see|see%2:39:02:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz," she 
answered, "and we stopped|stop%2:38:00:: at your cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:41:11:: Oz?" he asked. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: wants|want%2:37:00:: him to 
put|put%2:35:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: into his head," she replied. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: appeared|appear%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: deeply|deeply%4:02:00:: for a moment. Then|then%4:02:00:: he said: 
 
"Do you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart?" 
 
"Why, I guess|guess%1:10:00:: so," Dorothy answered; "it would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: as to give|give%2:40:00:: 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brains." 
 
 
 
"True," the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: returned. "So, if you will allow|allow%2:41:00:: me to join|join%2:41:00:: 
your party, I will also|also%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"Come along," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, heartily; and Dorothy added|add%2:32:01:: 
that she would be|be%2:42:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: his company. So the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
shouldered|shoulder%2:35:02:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to put|put%2:35:00:: the oil-can in her basket. 
"For," he said, "if I should get|get%2:30:00:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the rain, and rust|rust%1:22:00:: again, 
I would need|need%2:34:00:: the oil-can badly." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: their new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: join|join%2:41:00:: the party, 
for soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:01:: their journey|journey%1:04:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a place|place%1:15:00:: 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and branches|branch%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 over the road|road%1:06:00:: that the 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: could not|not%4:02:00:: pass. But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: 
and chopped|chop%2:35:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: that soon|soon%4:02:00:: he cleared|clear%2:30:02:: a passage|passage%1:06:00:: for the entire|entire%3:00:01:whole:00 party. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: as they walked|walk%2:38:00:: along that she did|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: notice|notice%2:39:04:: when the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: into a hole|hole%1:17:01:: and rolled|roll%2:38:01:: over|over%4:02:01:: to 
the side|side%1:15:02:: of the road. Indeed, he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:09:: to her to help|help%2:41:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"Why didn't you walk|walk%2:38:00:: around the hole?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I don't know|know%2:31:01:: enough," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, cheerfully. "My head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: with straw, you know, and that is|be%2:42:06:: why I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
him for some brains." 
 
"Oh, I see;" said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "But, after all, brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
the best|best%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
"Have you any?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"No, my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: empty," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "but once I had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains, and a heart|heart%1:09:00:: also; so, having|have%2:40:00:: tried|try%2:34:00:: them both, I should much|much%4:02:03:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"And why is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will know." 
 
So, while they were|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: 
the following|follow%2:42:05:: story: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: the son|son%1:18:00:: of a woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: who chopped|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: and sold|sell%2:40:00:: the wood|wood%1:27:00:: for a living. When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I too|too%4:02:01:: became|become%2:42:01:: a 
wood-chopper, and after my father|father%1:18:00:: died|die%2:30:00:: I took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:04:02:: of my old|old%3:00:02:: mother|mother%1:18:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she lived. Then|then%4:02:00:: I made|make%2:36:08:: up|up%4:02:00:: my mind|mind%1:09:04:: that instead|instead%4:02:01:: of living|live%2:42:01:: 
alone|alone%4:02:01:: I would marry, so that I might not|not%4:02:00:: become|become%2:30:00:: lonely. 
 
 
 
"There was|be%2:42:04:: one of the Munchkin girls|girl%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: that I 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: to love|love%2:37:00:: her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised|promise%2:32:00:: 
to marry|marry%2:41:00:: me as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as I could earn|earn%2:40:01:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 money|money%1:21:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: a better|better%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: for her; so I set|set%2:30:01:: to work|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever. But the girl|girl%1:18:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: 
with an old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: her to marry|marry%2:41:00:: anyone, for she was|be%2:42:03:: 
so|so%4:02:02:: lazy|lazy%3:00:00:idle:00 she wished|wish%2:37:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: to remain|remain%2:42:03:: with her and do|do%2:41:01:: the cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
and the housework. So the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: to the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and promised|promise%2:32:01:: her two sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: and a cow|cow%1:05:01:: if she would prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: the 
marriage. Thereupon the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: enchanted|enchant%2:37:00:: my axe, and when I was|be%2:42:03:: 
chopping|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:05:: at my best|best%3:00:00:: one day, for I was|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:40:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: and my wife|wife%1:18:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: all at once|once%4:02:02:: 
and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my left|left%3:00:00:: leg. 
 
"This at first|first%4:02:02:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 misfortune, for I knew|know%2:31:00:: a one-legged man|man%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wood-chopper. So I went|go%2:38:00:: to a tin-smith 
and had|have%2:32:00:: him make|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. The leg|leg%1:08:01:: worked|work%2:35:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well, 
once|once%4:02:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to it; but my action|action%1:04:02:: angered|anger%2:37:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the East, for she had|have%2:40:00:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: I should not|not%4:02:00:: marry|marry%2:41:00:: the 
pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: Munchkin girl. When I began|begin%2:30:00:: chopping|chop%2:35:01:: again|again%4:02:00:: my axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: and 
cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my right|right%3:00:00:: leg. Again I went|go%2:38:00:: to the tinner, and again|again%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: 
me a leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. After this the enchanted|enchanted%3:00:00:: axe|axe%1:06:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my arms, 
one after the other; but, nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: daunted, I had|have%2:30:00:: them replaced|replace%2:30:00:: with 
tin|tin%1:27:00:: ones. The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my 
head, and at first|first%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me. But the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: 
happened|happen%2:30:02:: to come|come%2:38:04:: along, and he made|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: head|head%1:08:00:: out of tin. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: beaten|beat%2:33:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then, and I worked|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than 
ever; but I little|little%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:01:: how cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 my enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: could be. She thought|think%2:31:00:: of a 
new|new%3:00:00:: way|way%1:04:01:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: my love|love%1:12:00:: for the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Munchkin maiden, and made|make%2:30:00:: my 
axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: again, so that it cut|cut%2:35:00:: right|right%4:02:09:: through my body, splitting me 
into two halves. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:03:: to my help|help%1:04:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: me a 
body|body%1:08:00:: of tin, fastening|fasten%2:35:00:: my tin|tin%1:27:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: to it, by means|mean%1:09:00:: of 
joints, so that I could move|move%2:38:01:: around|around%4:02:04:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. But, alas! I had|have%2:40:00:: 
now|now%4:02:00:: no heart, so that I lost|lose%2:40:02:: all my love|love%1:12:00:: for the Munchkin girl, and did|do%2:41:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether I married|marry%2:41:00:: her or not. I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: she is|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: living|live%2:42:08:: 
with the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for me to come|come%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
 
 
"My body|body%1:08:00:: shone|shine%2:43:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: in the sun|sun%1:17:00:: that I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of it 
and it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: if my axe slipped, for it could not|not%4:02:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: me. 
There was|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one danger--that my joints|joint%1:08:00:: would rust; but I kept|keep%2:40:01:: an 
oil-can in my cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:09:00:: to oil|oil%1:27:00:: myself whenever I needed|need%2:34:00:: 
it. However, there came|come%2:30:01:: a day|day%1:28:03:: when I forgot|forget%2:31:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: this, and, being|be%2:42:06:: 
caught|catch%2:35:03:: in a rainstorm, before I thought|think%2:31:00:: of the danger|danger%1:26:01:: my joints|joint%1:08:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
rusted, and I was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: in the woods|wood%1:14:00:: until you came|come%2:38:04:: to help|help%2:41:00:: 
me. It was|be%2:42:06:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 thing|thing%1:04:00:: to undergo, but during the year|year%1:28:01:: I stood|stand%2:42:04:: 
there|there%4:02:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: that the greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 loss|loss%1:11:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: known|know%2:31:04:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
the loss|loss%1:21:01:: of my heart. While I was|be%2:42:03:: in love|love%1:12:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: the happiest|happy%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: on 
earth; but no one can|can%1:06:02:: love|love%1:18:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: a heart, and so I am|be%2:42:03:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: 
to ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to give|give%2:40:00:: me one. If he does, I will go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the Munchkin 
maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: and marry|marry%2:41:00:: her." 
 
Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the 
story|story%1:10:03:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and now|now%4:02:05:: they knew|know%2:31:01:: why he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to 
get|get%2:30:01:: a new|new%3:00:00:: heart. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "I shall ask|ask%2:32:01:: for brains|brain%1:08:00:: instead|instead%4:02:00:: 
of a heart; for a fool|fool%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what to do|do%2:41:01:: with a heart|heart%1:09:00:: if he 
had|have%2:40:00:: one." 
 
"I shall take|take%2:35:00:: the heart," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "for brains|brain%1:08:00:: do|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: make|make%2:30:00:: one happy, and happiness|happiness%1:12:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: anything, for she was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: to know|know%2:31:01:: which of 
her two friends|friend%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: right, and she decided|decide%2:31:00:: if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: 
to Kansas|kansa%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: whether the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: no heart, or each got|get%2:40:00:: what he wanted. 
 
 
 
What worried|worry%2:37:01:: her most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: that the bread|bread%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: gone, and another 
meal|meal%1:13:00:: for herself and Toto would empty|empty%2:30:01:: the basket. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 neither 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: nor the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: anything, but she was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: 
of tin|tin%1:27:00:: nor straw, and could not|not%4:02:00:: live|live%2:42:04:: unless she was|be%2:42:03:: fed. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VI. 
 
 
All this time|time%1:28:05:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 woods. The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, but these 
were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: by dried|dry%2:30:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: and dead|dead%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: from the trees, 
and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all good. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: few|few%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: in this part|part%1:24:00:: of the forest, for birds|bird%1:05:00:: love|love%2:37:02:: the 
open|open%3:00:00:unobstructed:00 country|country%1:15:02:: where there is|be%2:42:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of sunshine; but now|now%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:01:: 
there came|come%2:38:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: from some wild|wild%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: hidden|hide%2:39:00:: among the trees. 
These sounds|sound%1:11:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl's heart beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast, for she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know|know%2:31:01:: what made|make%2:36:00:: them; but Toto knew, and he walked|walk%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy's 
side, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: even|even%2:30:01:: bark|bark%1:11:00:: in return. 
 
"How long|long%4:02:00:: will it be," the child|child%1:18:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "before we 
are|be%2:42:03:: out of the forest?" 
 
"I cannot tell," was|be%2:42:06:: the answer, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the 
Emerald City. But my father|father%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: there once, when I was|be%2:42:03:: a boy, and 
he said|say%2:32:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: through a dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: country, although 
nearer to the city|city%1:15:00:: where Oz dwells|dwell%2:42:00:: the country|country%1:15:02:: is|be%2:42:03:: beautiful. But I|i%1:27:00:: 
am not|not%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I have|have%2:40:00:: my oil-can, and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: can hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
Scarecrow, while you bear|bear%2:42:01:: upon your forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the good|good%3:00:02:: 
Witch's kiss, and that will protect|protect%2:33:00:: you from harm." 
 
"But Toto!" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously; "what will protect|protect%2:33:00:: him?" 
 
"We must protect|protect%2:33:00:: him ourselves, if he is|be%2:42:03:: in danger," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman. 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: as he spoke|speak%2:32:00:: there came|come%2:38:00:: from the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 roar, and the 
next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: bounded|bound%2:38:01:: into the road. With one blow|blow%1:04:01:: of his 
paw|paw%2:35:01:: he sent|send%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: spinning|spin%2:38:01:: over and over to the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the 
road, and then|then%4:02:00:: he struck|strike%2:35:00:: at the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: with his sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: claws. 
But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make|make%2:36:00:: no impression|impression%1:09:00:: on the tin, 
although the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: over|over%4:02:01:: in the road|road%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: still. 
 
Little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, now|now%4:02:05:: that he had|have%2:40:00:: an enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: to face, ran|run%2:38:00:: barking|bark%2:32:01:: toward the 
Lion, and the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: his mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: the dog, when 
Dorothy, fearing|fear%2:37:03:: Toto would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, and heedless of danger, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward|forward%4:02:00:: and slapped|slap%2:35:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: upon his nose|nose%1:08:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as she could, 
while she cried|cry%2:32:01:: out: 
 
"Don't you dare|dare%2:41:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: Toto! You ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself, a 
big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: like you, to bite|bite%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: dog!" 
 
"I didn't bite|bite%1:26:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, as he rubbed|rub%2:35:00:: his nose|nose%1:08:00:: with his 
paw|paw%1:08:01:: where Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: hit|hit%2:35:00:: it. 
 
"No, but you tried|try%2:41:00:: to," she retorted. "You are|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a big|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
coward." 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, hanging|hang%2:38:03:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in shame; "I've always|always%4:02:00:: 
known|know%2:31:01:: it. But how can I help|help%2:41:00:: it?" 
 
"I don't know, I'm sure. To think|think%2:31:00:: of your striking|strike%2:35:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: man, 
like the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow!" 
 
"Is he stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, in surprise, as he watched|watch%2:41:00:: her pick|pick%1:14:00:: 
up the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet, while she patted|pat%2:35:01:: him into 
shape|shape%1:08:00:: again. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: he's stuffed," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: angry. 
 
"That's why he went|go%2:38:00:: over so|so%4:02:02:: easily," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. "It astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
me to see|see%2:39:00:: him whirl|whirl%1:04:02:: around so. Is|be%2:42:03:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one stuffed, also?" 
 
"No," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "he's made|make%2:42:05:: of tin." And she helped|help%2:41:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
again. 
 
"That's why he nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: blunted|blunt%2:30:01:: my claws," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "When they 
scratched|scratch%2:35:03:: against the tin|tin%1:06:01:: it made|make%2:32:00:: a cold|cold%1:09:00:: shiver|shiver%2:38:00:: run|run%2:38:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: my back. 
What is|be%2:42:06:: that little|little%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: tender|tender%3:00:00:loving:00 of?" 
 
"He is|be%2:42:06:: my dog, Toto," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Is he made|make%2:42:05:: of tin, or stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Neither. He's a--a--a meat|meat%1:13:01:: dog," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh. He's a curious|curious%3:00:00:: animal, and seems|seem%2:39:00:: remarkably|remarkably%4:02:00:: small, now|now%4:02:05:: that I 
look|look%2:39:00:: at him. No|no%1:10:00:: one would think|think%2:31:00:: of biting|bite%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: except 
a coward|coward%1:18:00:: like me," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the Lion, sadly. 
 
"What makes|make%2:30:00:: you a coward?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, looking|look%2:39:00:: at the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: 
in wonder, for he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as a small|small%3:00:00:: horse. 
 
 
 
"It's a mystery," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: that 
way. All the other|other%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to be|be%2:42:03:: 
brave, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts. 
I learned|learn%2:31:00:: that if I roared|roar%2:32:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: every living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: and got|get%2:30:00:: out of my way. Whenever I've met|meet%2:38:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: I've been|be%2:42:03:: 
awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: scared; but I just|just%4:02:03:: roared|roar%2:32:03:: at him, and he has|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could go. If the elephants|elephant%1:05:00:: and the tigers|tiger%1:05:00:: and the bears|bear%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: tried|try%2:41:00:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: me, I should have|have%2:40:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: myself--I'm such a 
coward; but just|just%4:02:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they hear|hear%2:39:00:: me roar|roar%1:10:00:: they all try|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:35:09:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: from me, and of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them go." 
 
"But that isn't right. The King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts|beast%1:03:00:: shouldn't be|be%2:42:03:: a coward," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:01:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: a tear|tear%2:29:00:: from his eye|eye%1:08:00:: with the 
tip|tip%1:25:00:: of his tail; "it is|be%2:42:06:: my great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow, and makes|make%2:30:00:: my life|life%1:26:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
unhappy. But whenever there is|be%2:42:04:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: my heart|heart%1:08:00:: begins|begin%2:30:00:: to beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast." 
 
"Perhaps you have|have%2:29:02:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"It may be," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"If you have," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: glad, for 
it proves|prove%2:31:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. For my part, I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart; so I cannot 
have|have%2:40:00:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease." 
 
"Perhaps," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully, "if I had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should 
not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Have you brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so. I've never|never%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: to see," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I am going|go%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, "for my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw." 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: Toto and me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," added|add%2:32:01:: 
Dorothy. 
 
"Do you think|think%2:31:03:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion. 
 
"Just as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as he could give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Or give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Or send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go|go%2:38:00:: with you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for my 
life|life%1:26:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: simply|simply%4:02:03:: unbearable|unbearable%3:00:00:: without a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of courage." 
 
"You will be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: welcome," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "for you will help|help%2:41:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts. It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me they must be|be%2:42:06:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: than you are|be%2:42:03:: if they allow|allow%2:32:00:: you to scare|scare%2:37:00:: them so easily." 
 
"They really|really%4:02:03:: are," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "but that doesn't make|make%2:30:00:: me any braver, 
and as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I know|know%2:31:02:: myself to be|be%2:42:03:: a coward|coward%1:18:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: unhappy." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: company|company%1:14:01:: set|set%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the journey, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 strides|stride%1:04:00:: at Dorothy's side. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: approve|approve%2:32:00:: 
this new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: at first, for he could not|not%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: how nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: he 
had|have%2:30:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: crushed|crush%2:35:00:: between the Lion's great|great%3:00:01:large:00 jaws; but after a time|time%1:28:00:: he 
became|become%2:30:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: at ease, and presently|presently%4:02:00:: Toto and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
grown|grow%2:30:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: friends. 
 
During the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of that day|day%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: no other|other%3:00:00:: adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: to mar the 
peace|peace%1:26:02:: of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon a 
beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: crawling|crawl%2:38:00:: along the road, and killed|kill%2:35:00:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: 
thing. This made|make%2:30:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy, for he was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: 
careful|careful%3:00:00:mindful:00 not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: any living|live%2:42:04:: creature; and as he walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he 
wept|weep%2:29:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 tears|tear%1:08:01:: of sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: and regret. These tears|tear%1:08:01:: ran|run%2:38:01:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
his face|face%1:08:00:: and over the hinges|hinge%1:06:00:: of his jaw, and there they rusted. 
When Dorothy presently|presently%4:02:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: him a question|question%1:10:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could 
not|not%4:02:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: his mouth, for his jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: together. He 
became|become%2:30:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at this and made|make%2:41:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: motions|motion%1:04:00:: to Dorothy to 
relieve|relieve%2:40:01:: him, but she could not|not%4:02:00:: understand. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: 
to know|know%2:31:01:: what was|be%2:42:03:: wrong. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the oil-can from 
Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few|few%3:00:00:: 
moments|moment%1:28:01:: he could talk|talk%2:32:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as before. 
 
 
 
"This will serve|serve%2:42:03:: me a lesson," said|say%2:32:00:: he, "to look|look%2:39:00:: where I step. For if 
I should kill|kill%2:35:00:: another bug|bug%1:05:02:: or beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: I should surely|surely%4:02:00:: cry|cry%2:29:00:: again, and 
crying|cry%2:34:00:: rusts|rust%2:30:01:: my jaw|jaw%1:08:00:: so that I cannot speak." 
 
Thereafter|thereafter%4:02:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: carefully, with his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on the road, 
and when he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 ant|ant%1:05:00:: toiling by he would step|step%2:38:01:: over it, so|so%4:02:05:: as 
not|not%4:02:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: it. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and 
therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: he took|take%2:41:04:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 care|care%1:09:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 or unkind|unkind%3:00:00:: to anything. 
 
"You people|people%1:14:00:: with hearts," he said, "have something to guide|guide%2:38:00:: you, 
and need never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: wrong; but I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and so I must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
careful. When Oz gives|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: of course|course%1:14:00:: I needn't mind|mind%1:09:00:: so much."

They were|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to camp|camp%1:06:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: that night|night%1:28:00:: under a large|large%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no houses|house%1:06:00:: near. The tree|tree%1:20:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a good, thick|thick%3:00:01:: 
covering|cover%2:35:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: them from the dew, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood|wood%1:27:00:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and Dorothy built|build%2:36:00:: a splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 fire|fire%1:06:00:: that 
warmed|warm%2:30:01:: her and made|make%2:30:00:: her feel|feel%2:37:00:: less|less%4:02:00:: lonely. She and Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: the last|last%3:00:00:: of 
their bread, and now|now%4:02:05:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what they would do|do%2:41:01:: for breakfast. 
 
"If you wish," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I will go|go%2:38:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and kill|kill%2:35:00:: a 
deer|deer%1:05:00:: for you. You can roast|roast%1:13:00:: it by the fire, since your tastes|taste%1:12:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
peculiar|peculiar%3:00:00:unusual:00 that you prefer|prefer%2:37:00:: cooked|cook%2:36:01:: food, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will have|have%2:34:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: breakfast." 
 
"Don't! please|please%2:37:01:: don't," begged|beg%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "I should certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: 
weep if you killed|kill%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 deer, and then|then%4:02:00:: my jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: would rust|rust%1:22:00:: again." 
 
 
 
But the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 supper, and no 
one|one%1:23:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: knew|know%2:31:01:: what it was, for he didn't mention|mention%1:10:01:: it. And the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
found|find%2:40:02:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: with them, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that she would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: hungry|hungry%3:00:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: time. She thought|think%2:31:03:: this was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
kind|kind%1:09:00:: and thoughtful|thoughtful%3:00:00:considerate:00 of the Scarecrow, but she laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: heartily|heartily%4:02:03:: at the 
awkward|awkward%3:00:00:unwieldy:00 way|way%1:07:01:: in which the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 creature|creature%1:03:00:: picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the nuts. His padded|padded%3:00:00:soft:01 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 and the nuts|nut%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that he dropped|drop%2:38:00:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: as he put|put%2:35:00:: in the basket. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: how 
long|long%4:02:00:: it took|take%2:40:06:: him to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the basket, for it enabled|enable%2:30:00:: him to keep|keep%2:41:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
from the fire, as he feared|fear%2:37:03:: a spark|spark%2:43:00:: might get|get%2:38:12:: into his straw|straw%1:27:01:: and burn|burn%2:30:02:: 
him up. So he kept|keep%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: from the flames, and only|only%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
near to cover|cover%2:35:00:: Dorothy with dry|dry%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: when she lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to sleep. These 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: her very|very%4:02:00:: snug|snug%3:00:00:comfortable:00 and warm|warm%3:00:01:: and she slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until morning. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: daylight|daylight%1:19:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: bathed|bath%2:29:00:: her face|face%1:08:00:: in a little|little%3:00:01:: rippling|ripple%2:38:00:: 
brook|brook%1:17:00:: and soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they all started|start%2:38:02:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
This was|be%2:42:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: an eventful|eventful%3:00:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: for the travellers. They had|have%2:40:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: an hour|hour%1:28:00:: when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: before them a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: that 
crossed|cross%2:38:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: and divided|divide%2:41:00:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see|see%2:39:00:: on 
either side. It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: ditch, and when they crept|creep%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the 
edge|edge%1:15:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: into it they could see|see%2:39:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: deep, and 
there were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: big, jagged|jagged%3:00:00:uneven:00 rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. The sides|side%1:15:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:07:: 
steep|steep%1:17:00:: that none|none%1:28:00:: of them could climb|climb%2:38:00:: down, and for a moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
that their journey|journey%1:04:00:: must end. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, despairingly. 
 
"I haven't the faintest|faint%3:00:02:indistinct:00 idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
shook|shake%2:38:00:: his shaggy mane|mane%1:05:00:: and looked|look%2:29:00:: thoughtful. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said: 
 
"We cannot fly, that is|be%2:42:03:: certain; neither can we climb|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into this 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump|jump%1:11:00:: over it, we must stop|stop%2:38:00:: where 
we are." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:03:: I could jump|jump%2:38:00:: over it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, after 
measuring|measure%2:30:00:: the distance|distance%1:07:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in his mind. 
 
"Then we are|be%2:42:03:: all right," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for you can carry|carry%2:38:07:: 
us all over|over%4:02:05:: on your back, one at a time." 
 
"Well, I'll try|try%1:04:00:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "Who will go|go%2:41:00:: first?" 
 
"I will," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "for, if you found|find%2:31:09:: that you could 
not|not%4:02:00:: jump|jump%2:38:00:: over the gulf, Dorothy would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, or the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
badly|badly%4:02:00:: dented|dent%2:35:00:: on the rocks|rock%1:17:01:: below. But if I am|be%2:42:05:: on your back|back%1:08:00:: it will not|not%4:02:00:: 
matter so|so%4:02:02:: much, for the fall|fall%1:04:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me at all." 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of falling, myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, 
"but I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but try|try%2:41:01:: it. So|so%4:02:05:: get|get%2:30:00:: on my back|back%1:08:00:: 
and we will make|make%2:41:00:: the attempt." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:38:00:: upon the Lion's back, and the big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to 
the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: and crouched|crouch%2:38:00:: down. 
 
"Why don't you run|run%2:38:00:: and jump?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Because that isn't the way|way%1:07:01:: we Lions|lion%1:05:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: these things," he replied. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: giving|give%2:40:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spring, he shot|shoot%2:38:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: and landed|land%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: 
on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. They were|be%2:42:03:: all greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: how easily|easily%4:02:01:: he 
did|do%2:36:01:: it, and after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:41:00:: got|get%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from his back|back%1:08:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
sprang|spring%2:38:01:: across the ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: again. 
 
Dorothy thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:38:00:: next; so she took|take%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
climbed|climb%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back, holding|hold%2:35:00:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: to his mane|mane%1:05:00:: with one 
hand. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: as if she was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: through the air; 
and then, before she had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about it, she was|be%2:42:03:: safe|safe%3:00:01:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: a third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: and got|get%2:40:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
and then|then%4:02:00:: they all sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: for a few|few%3:00:00:: moments|moment%1:28:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: the beast|beast%1:03:00:: a 
chance|chance%1:26:00:: to rest, for his great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 leaps|leap%1:04:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: his breath|breath%1:27:00:: short, and he 
panted|pant%2:32:00:: like a big|big%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: that has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: running|run%2:38:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long. 
 
 
 
They found|find%2:31:10:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 on this side, and it looked|look%2:39:01:: dark|dark%1:28:00:: 
and gloomy. After the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: rested|rest%2:32:00:: they started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, silently wondering, each in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mind, if ever|ever%4:02:04:: 
they would come|come%2:38:04:: to the end|end%1:15:00:: of the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and reach|reach%2:38:01:: the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: 
again. To add|add%2:30:00:: to their discomfort, they soon|soon%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: noises|noise%1:11:00:: in 
the depths|depth%1:07:00:: of the forest, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: to them that it was|be%2:42:06:: 
in this part|part%1:15:00:: of the country|country%1:15:00:: that the Kalidahs lived. 
 
"What are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:03:: monstrous|monstrous%3:00:00:evil:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:00:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like 
tigers," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion; "and with claws|claw%1:05:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%3:00:01:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: that 
they could tear|tear%2:35:00:: me in two as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as I could kill|kill%2:35:00:: Toto. I'm 
terribly|terribly%4:02:01:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of the Kalidahs." 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: that you are," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy "They must be|be%2:42:03:: 
dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 beasts." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to another gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: 
across the road; but this one|one%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: broad|broad%3:00:04:: and deep|deep%3:00:00:thick:01 that the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
knew|know%2:31:01:: at once|once%4:02:00:: he could not|not%4:02:00:: leap|leap%2:38:00:: across it. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: what they should do, and after serious|serious%3:00:00:critical:03 
thought|think%2:31:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 tree, standing|stand%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the ditch. If the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: can chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, so that it will fall|fall%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side, we 
can walk|walk%2:38:00:: across it easily." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: a first|first%3:00:00:best:00 rate|rate%1:24:00:: idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "One would almost|almost%4:02:00:: suspect|suspect%2:32:00:: 
you had|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of straw." 
 
The Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: at once, and so|so%4:02:02:: sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: that the 
tree|tree%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: through. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: put|put%2:35:05:: his strong|strong%3:00:00:: 
front|front%3:00:00:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: against the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and pushed|push%2:38:00:: with all his might, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
the big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: tipped|tip%2:38:01:: and fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:04:00:: across the ditch, with its 
top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. 
 
They had|have%2:40:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: started|start%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: this queer|queer%1:18:00:: bridge|bridge%1:06:00:: when a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: 
made|make%2:32:00:: them all look|look%2:39:00:: up, and to their horror|horror%1:12:01:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: toward 
them two great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:01:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like tigers. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs!" said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble. 
 
"Quick!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, "let us cross|cross%2:38:00:: over." 
 
 
 
So Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: first, holding|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms; the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
followed, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: next. The Lion, although he was|be%2:42:03:: 
certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: afraid, turned|turn%2:38:00:: to face|face%2:32:00:: the Kalidahs, and then|then%4:02:00:: he gave|give%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
loud|loud%3:00:00:: and terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 a roar|roar%1:11:00:: that Dorothy screamed|scream%2:32:01:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
over backwards, while even|even%4:02:00:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%3:00:02:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: 
at him in surprise. 
 
But, seeing|see%2:31:01:: they were|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the Lion, and remembering|remember%2:31:00:: that 
there were|be%2:42:04:: two of them and only|only%4:02:02:: one of him, the Kalidahs again|again%4:02:00:: rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: over the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:31:01:: what 
they would do|do%2:41:01:: next. Without stopping|stop%2:42:00:: an instant|instant%1:28:01:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: 
also|also%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: the tree, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: lost, for they will surely|surely%4:02:00:: tear|tear%2:35:01:: us to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: with their sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
claws. But stand|stand%1:06:03:: close|close%1:28:00:: behind me, and I will fight|fight%2:33:01:: them as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I 
am|be%2:42:03:: alive." 
 
"Wait a minute!" called|call%2:32:09:: the Scarecrow. He had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: what was|be%2:42:06:: 
best|best%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: done, and now|now%4:02:05:: he asked|ask%2:32:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:01:: the end|end%1:15:00:: 
of the tree|tree%1:20:00:: that rested|rest%2:35:00:: on their side|side%1:15:02:: of the ditch. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to use|use%2:34:01:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: at once, and, just|just%4:02:05:: as the two Kalidahs were|be%2:42:03:: 
nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: across, the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: into the gulf, carrying|carry%2:35:02:: the 
ugly, snarling brutes|brute%1:18:00:: with it, and both were|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:35:02:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: on the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, drawing|draw%2:34:01:: a long|long%3:00:02:: breath|breath%1:04:00:: of relief, "I 
see|see%2:31:01:: we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to live|live%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: while longer, and I am|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: of it, 
for it must be|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: alive. Those 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: me so|so%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: that my heart|heart%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: beating|beat%2:38:00:: yet." 
 
"Ah." said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly, "I wish|wish%1:12:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:08:00:: to beat." 
 
 
 
This adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: out of 
the forest, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: that Dorothy became|become%2:30:00:: tired, and had|have%2:40:00:: 
to ride|ride%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back. To their great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy|joy%1:12:00:: the trees|tree%1:20:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: thinner|thin%3:00:01:insignificant:00 
the further|far%4:02:04:: they advanced, and in the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: they suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon 
a broad|broad%3:00:04:: river, flowing|flow%2:38:00:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: before them. On the other|other%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the water|water%1:27:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through a 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country, with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 meadows|meadow%1:15:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: with bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:02:: and 
all the road|road%1:06:00:: bordered|border%2:42:00:: with trees|tree%1:20:00:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits. They 
were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: this delightful|delightful%3:00:00:pleasing:00 country|country%1:15:02:: before them. 
 
"How shall we cross|cross%2:38:00:: the river?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: done," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: must 
build|build%2:36:00:: us a raft, so we can float|float%2:38:01:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: took|take%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: small|small%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
a raft, and while he was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: at this the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: on the river|river%1:17:00:: 
bank|bank%2:40:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fruit. This pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but nuts|nut%1:20:00:: all day, and she made|make%2:30:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 meal|meal%1:13:00:: of the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: fruit. 
 
But it takes|take%2:42:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to make|make%2:36:01:: a raft, even|even%4:02:00:: when one is|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: industrious|industrious%3:00:00:diligent:00 and 
untiring as the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and when night|night%1:28:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: the work|work%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: done. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they found|find%2:40:02:: a cozy|cozy%3:00:00:comfortable:00 place|place%1:15:00:: under the trees|tree%1:20:00:: where they slept|sleep%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: until 
the morning; and Dorothy dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: of the Emerald City, and of the good|good%3:00:01:: 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: Oz, who would soon|soon%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: her back|back%4:02:04:: to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VIII. 
 
 
Our little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: of travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:01:: next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: refreshed|refresh%2:30:00:: and 
full|full%3:00:00:: of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted|breakfast%2:34:00:: like a princess|princess%1:18:00:: off peaches|peach%1:13:00:: and 
plums|plum%1:13:00:: from the trees|tree%1:20:00:: beside the river. 
 
Behind them was|be%2:42:03:: the dark|dark%3:00:01:: forest|forest%1:14:00:: they had|have%2:30:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: through, 
although they had|have%2:39:06:: suffered|suffer%2:39:01:: many|many%3:00:00:: discouragements; but before them was|be%2:42:05:: a 
lovely, sunny|sunny%3:00:00:cheerful:00 country|country%1:15:02:: that seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to beckon|beckon%2:32:00:: them on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, the broad|broad%3:00:04:: river|river%1:17:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: them off|off%4:02:00:: from this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
land; but the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: done, and after the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: 
a few|few%3:00:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: logs|log%1:27:01:: and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: them together|together%4:02:02:: with wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pins, they 
were|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to start. Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the raft|raft%1:06:00:: and 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon the raft|raft%1:06:00:: 
it tipped|tip%2:38:01:: badly, for he was|be%2:42:03:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy; but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to steady|steady%3:00:00:secure:03 it, and they had|have%2:40:01:: long|long%4:02:00:: 
poles|pole%1:06:00:: in their hands|hand%1:08:00:: to push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: through the water. 
 
They got|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: at first, but when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the middle|middle%1:09:00:: 
of the river|river%1:17:00:: the swift|swift%3:00:00:fast:01 current|current%1:11:00:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: stream, farther|far%4:02:00:: 
and farther|far%4:02:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick; and the water|water%1:27:00:: grew|grow%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
deep|deep%4:02:00:: that the long|long%3:00:01:: poles|pole%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the bottom. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: bad," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for if we cannot get|get%2:38:00:: to the 
land|land%2:38:03:: we shall be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: into the country|country%1:15:02:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
West, and she will enchant|enchant%2:37:00:: us and make|make%2:30:00:: us her slaves." 
 
"And then|then%4:02:02:: I should get|get%2:40:00:: no brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I should never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"We must certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: if we can," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
continued, and he pushed|push%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: on his long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: that it stuck|stick%2:38:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: 
in the mud|mud%1:27:00:: at the bottom|bottom%1:17:00:: of the river, and before he could pull|pull%2:35:00:: it 
out again, or let|let%2:41:00:: go, the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
left|left%4:02:03:: clinging|cling%2:35:00:: to the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the river. 
 
"Good bye!" he called|call%2:32:09:: after them, and they were|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to leave|leave%2:38:01:: 
him; indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cry, but fortunately|fortunately%4:02:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:01:: 
that he might rust, and so|so%4:02:05:: dried|dry%2:30:01:: his tears|tear%1:08:01:: on Dorothy's apron. 
 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: this was|be%2:42:06:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: for the Scarecrow. 
 
"I am now|now%4:02:00:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: than when I first|first%4:02:02:: met|meet%2:38:01:: Dorothy," he thought. 
"Then, I was|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a cornfield, where I could make|make%2:36:00:: 
believe|believe%2:31:00:: scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows, at any rate; but surely|surely%4:02:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: no use|use%1:07:00:: for 
a Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a river. I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: any brains, after all!" 
 
 
 
Down the stream|stream%1:17:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: floated, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said: 
 
"Something must be|be%2:42:06:: done|do%2:36:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: us. I think|think%2:31:03:: I can swim|swim%2:38:00:: to the shore|shore%1:06:00:: 
and pull|pull%2:35:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: after me, if you will only|only%4:02:02:: hold|hold%2:42:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: to the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of 
my tail." 
 
 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: into the water|water%1:27:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his tail, when the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to swim|swim%2:38:00:: with all his might|might%1:07:00:: toward 
the shore. It was|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, although he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big; but by and by 
they were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:03:: out of the current, and then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy took|take%2:40:15:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman's long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: and helped|help%2:41:00:: push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: to the land. 
 
They were|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tire%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the shore|shore%1:17:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 and 
stepped|step%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grass, and they also|also%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: that the 
stream|stream%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them a long|long%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: past the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: that 
led|lead%2:42:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to let|let%2:41:00:: the sun|sun%1:19:00:: dry|dry%3:00:01:: him. 
 
"We must get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, in some way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The best|best%3:00:00:: plan|plan%1:09:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: along the river|river%1:17:00:: bank|bank%1:17:01:: until we come|come%2:38:04:: to 
the road|road%1:06:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So, when they were|be%2:42:03:: rested, Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and they 
started|start%2:38:02:: along the grassy|grassy%3:00:00:: bank, back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: from which the river|river%1:17:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 country, with plenty|plenty%1:23:00:: of flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
and fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: and sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: to cheer|cheer%2:37:02:: them, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:29:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
sorry for the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they could have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 happy. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could, Dorothy only|only%4:02:02:: stopping|stop%2:38:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: to 
pick|pick%2:31:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: flower; and after a time|time%1:28:05:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:07:: out, 
 
"Look!" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they all looked|look%2:39:00:: at the river|river%1:17:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon 
his pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the water, looking|look%2:39:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:uninhabited:00 and sad. 
 
"What can we do|do%2:41:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: him?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: both shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads, for they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know. So they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the bank|bank%1:17:01:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: wistfully|wistfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: until a Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: by, which, seeing|see%2:39:00:: them, stopped|stop%2:38:00:: to rest|rest%2:32:00:: 
at the water's edge. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl; "and these are|be%2:42:06:: my friends, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion; and we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"This isn't the road," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, as she twisted|twist%2:38:01:: her long|long%3:00:01:: neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: at the queer party. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, "but we have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: the Scarecrow, and 
are|be%2:42:03:: wondering|wonder%2:32:01:: how we shall get|get%2:35:03:: him again." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: he?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"Over there|there%4:02:00:: in the river," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"If he wasn't so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: I would get|get%2:35:03:: him for you," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Stork. 
 
"He isn't heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: a bit," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, eagerly, "for he is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: 
with straw; and if you will bring|bring%2:38:00:: him back|back%4:02:04:: to us we shall thank|thank%2:32:00:: you 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: and ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much." 
 
"Well, I'll try," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork; "but if I find|find%2:31:10:: he is|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to 
carry|carry%2:30:05:: I shall have|have%2:39:06:: to drop|drop%2:38:01:: him in the river|river%1:17:00:: again." 
 
So the big|big%3:00:01:: bird|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and over the water|water%1:17:00:: till she came|come%2:38:04:: to 
where the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon his pole. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: with 
her great|great%3:00:01:large:00 claws|claw%1:05:02:: grabbed|grab%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: by the arm|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: 
into the air|air%1:15:00:: and back|back%4:02:04:: to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and Toto were|be%2:42:03:: sitting. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:39:01:: himself among his friends|friend%1:18:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
happy|happy%3:00:00:: that he hugged|hug%2:35:01:: them all, even|even%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto; and as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he sang|sing%2:36:00:: "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt|feel%2:31:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: gay. 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: I should have|have%2:39:06:: to stay|stay%2:42:02:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: forever," he said, 
"but the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: me, and if I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: any brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
find|find%2:39:01:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and do|do%2:36:02:: it some kindness|kindness%1:04:00:: in return." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, who was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside them. 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: anyone in trouble. But I must go|go%2:38:01:: now, for 
my babies|baby%1:18:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: in the nest|nest%1:17:00:: for me. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: the 
Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and that Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the 
air|air%1:27:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along listening|listen%2:39:00:: to the singing|singing%1:04:00:: of the bright-colored 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: which now|now%4:02:05:: became|become%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 that 
the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: carpeted|carpet%2:35:01:: with them. There were|be%2:42:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: and 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 blossoms, besides great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clusters|cluster%1:14:00:: of scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: they almost|almost%4:02:00:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: Dorothy's eyes. 
 
"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked, as she breathed|breathe%2:29:00:: in the spicy 
scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "When I have|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
probably|probably%4:02:00:: like them better." 
 
"If I only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should love|love%2:37:00:: them," added|add%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: like flowers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "they seem|seem%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: helpless|helpless%3:00:00:dependent:00 
and frail. But there are|be%2:42:04:: none|none%1:28:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as these." 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon more|more%3:00:02:: and more|more%3:00:02:: of the big|big%3:00:01:: scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, and 
fewer|few%3:00:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: of the other|other%3:00:00:: flowers; and soon|soon%4:02:00:: they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 meadow|meadow%1:15:00:: of poppies. Now|now%1:28:00:: it is|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:00:: 
that when there are|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these flowers|flower%1:20:02:: together|together%4:02:03:: their odor|odor%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: that anyone who breathes|breathe%2:29:00:: it falls|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, and if the sleeper|sleeper%1:18:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: he sleeps|sleep%2:29:00:: on and on 
forever. But Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, nor could she get|get%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from 
the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that were|be%2:42:04:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: about; so|so%4:02:05:: presently|presently%4:02:00:: her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: heavy|heavy%3:00:03:: and she felt|feel%2:31:00:: she must sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to rest|rest%1:04:00:: and to sleep. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. 
 
"We must hurry|hurry%2:38:00:: and get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: before dark," 
he said; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. So they kept|keep%2:42:07:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: 
until Dorothy could stand|stand%2:35:00:: no longer. Her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of 
herself and she forgot|forget%2:31:01:: where she was|be%2:42:05:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: among the poppies, fast|fast%4:02:01:: 
asleep. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"If we leave|leave%2:31:05:: her here|here%4:02:00:: she will die," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "The smell|smell%1:07:00:: of the 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: killing|kill%2:30:04:: us all. I myself can scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:42:00:: my eyes|eye%1:08:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: 
and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: already." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: true; Toto had|have%2:42:00:: fallen|fall%2:30:08:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh, were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
troubled|trouble%2:37:01:: by the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
 
 
"Run fast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Lion, "and get|get%2:30:00:: out of this 
deadly|deadly%3:00:00:unpardonable:00 flower-bed as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as you can. We will bring|bring%2:38:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with us, but if you should fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried." 
 
So the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: aroused|arouse%2:37:01:: himself and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could 
go. In a moment|moment%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: out of sight. 
 
"Let us make|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with our hands, and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. So they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: Toto and put|put%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in Dorothy's lap, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: they made|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with their hands|hand%1:08:00:: for the seat|seat%1:06:01:: and their arms|arm%1:08:00:: for 
the arms|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:02:: between them through the flowers. 
 
On and on they walked, and it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: of deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: them would never|never%4:02:00:: end. They followed|follow%2:38:01:: the bend|bend%1:06:00:: 
of the river, and at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 came|come%2:38:04:: upon their friend|friend%1:18:00:: the Lion, lying|lie%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:01:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: among the poppies. The flowers|flower%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:intense:00 for 
the huge|huge%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: and he had|have%2:42:00:: given|give%2:38:13:: up, at last, and fallen|fall%2:38:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: a short|short%3:00:02:: 
distance|distance%1:07:00:: from the end|end%1:15:00:: of the poppy-bed, where the sweet|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 grass|grass%1:20:00:: spread|spread%1:04:00:: 
in beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: before them. 
 
"We can do|do%2:36:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: for him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly; "for he is|be%2:42:03:: 
much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to lift. We must leave|leave%2:31:05:: him here|here%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: on forever, 
and perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: he will dream|dream%2:39:00:: that he has|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: at last." 
 
"I'm sorry," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: 
for one so|so%4:02:02:: cowardly. But let|let%2:41:00:: us go|go%2:30:01:: on." 
 
They carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: to a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 spot|spot%1:15:01:: beside the river, 
far|far%4:02:02:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: from the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: field|field%1:15:00:: to prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: her breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: any more|more%3:00:02:: of 
the poison|poison%1:27:00:: of the flowers, and here|here%4:02:00:: they laid|lay%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: for the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: breeze|breeze%1:19:00:: to waken|waken%2:29:00:: her. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IX. 
 
 
"We cannot be|be%2:42:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, now," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, as he stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside the girl, "for we have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as 
far|far%4:02:02:: as the river|river%1:17:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: us away." 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when he heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:03:: growl, and 
turning|turn%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: (which worked|work%2:35:02:: beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: on hinges) he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a 
strange|strange%3:00:00:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: bounding|bound%2:38:01:: over the grass|grass%1:20:00:: towards them. It was, 
indeed, a great, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 wildcat, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it must be|be%2:42:06:: 
chasing|chase%2:38:00:: something, for its ears|ear%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to its head|head%1:08:00:: and its 
mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: open, showing|show%2:39:00:: two rows|row%1:14:00:: of ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: teeth, while its red|red%1:07:00:: 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: glowed|glow%2:39:00:: like balls|ball%1:25:00:: of fire. As it came|come%2:38:04:: nearer the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
saw|saw%2:35:00:: that running|run%2:38:00:: before the beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 field-mouse, and 
although he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: he knew|know%2:31:02:: it was|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: for the wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: to try|try%2:41:00:: 
to kill|kill%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a pretty, harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: creature. 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, and as the wildcat|wildcat%1:06:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: by he gave|give%2:40:03:: it a 
quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 blow|blow%1:04:01:: that cut|cut%2:35:00:: the beast's head|head%2:38:01:: clean|clean%3:00:00:perfect:00 off|off%4:02:03:: from its body, and it 
rolled|roll%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: at his feet|foot%1:08:01:: in two pieces. 
 
The field-mouse, now|now%4:02:05:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: freed|free%2:41:00:: from its enemy, stopped|stop%2:38:01:: short; 
and coming|come%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: up to the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: it said, in a squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you! Thank|thank%2:32:00:: you ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: for saving|save%2:41:00:: my life." 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:01:: of it, I beg|beg%2:32:01:: of you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
heart, you know, so I am|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: to help|help%2:29:00:: all those who may need|need%2:34:01:: a 
friend, even|even%4:02:00:: if it happens|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a mouse." 
 
"Only a mouse!" cried|cry%2:32:07:: the little|little%3:00:01:: animal, indignantly; "why, I am|be%2:42:03:: a 
Queen--the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: of all the field-mice!" 
 
"Oh, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, making|make%2:41:00:: a bow. 
 
"Therefore you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deed, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:07:: as a brave|brave%2:42:00:: one, in 
saving|save%2:41:05:: my life," added|add%2:32:01:: the Queen. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as their 
little|little%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: could carry|carry%2:35:02:: them, and when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: their Queen|queen%1:18:01:: they 
exclaimed, 
 
[Illustration: "_Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the 
Queen._"] 
 
"Oh, your Majesty, we thought|think%2:31:03:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: killed! How did|do%2:41:01:: you manage|manage%2:41:09:: 
to escape|escape%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wildcat?" and they all bowed|bow%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: low|low%3:00:01:: to the 
little|little%3:00:01:: Queen|queen%1:18:01:: that they almost|almost%4:02:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon their heads. 
 
"This funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 tin|tin%1:27:00:: man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: and saved|save%2:41:01:: my 
life. So|so%4:02:05:: hereafter|hereafter%4:02:00:: you must all serve|serve%2:41:01:: him, and obey|obey%2:41:00:: his slightest|slight%3:00:00:: wish." 
 
"We will!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: all the mice, in a shrill|shrill%3:00:00:high:03 chorus. And then|then%4:02:00:: they 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: in all directions, for Toto had|have%2:40:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: from his sleep, 
and seeing|see%2:39:00:: all these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: around him he gave|give%2:41:00:: one bark|bark%1:11:00:: of delight|delight%1:12:00:: and 
jumped|jump%2:38:00:: right|right%4:02:04:: into the middle|middle%1:09:00:: of the group. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: to 
chase mice|mouse%1:05:00:: when he lived|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, and he saw|saw%2:35:00:: no harm|harm%1:11:01:: in it. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in his arms|arm%1:08:00:: and held|hold%2:35:00:: him tight, 
while he called|call%2:32:09:: to the mice: "Come back! come|come%2:38:00:: back! Toto shall not|not%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: you." 
 
At this the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: stuck|stick%2:38:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: out from a clump|clump%1:14:00:: of 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and asked, in a timid|timid%3:00:00:cowardly:00 voice, 
 
"Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: he will not|not%4:02:00:: bite|bite%2:35:00:: us?" 
 
"I will not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
 
 
One by one the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: creeping|creep%2:38:00:: back, and Toto did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: bark|bark%2:32:00:: again, 
although he tried|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the Woodman's arms, and would have|have%2:40:00:: 
bitten|bite%2:35:00:: him had|have%2:40:00:: he not|not%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Finally|finally%4:02:03:: one 
of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: mice|mouse%1:05:00:: spoke. 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: anything we can do," it asked, "to repay|repay%2:40:00:: you for saving|save%2:41:01:: the 
life|life%1:18:00:: of our Queen?" 
 
"Nothing that I know|know%2:31:01:: of," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to think, but could not|not%4:02:00:: because his head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, said, quickly, 
 
"Oh, yes; you can save|save%2:41:01:: our friend, the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, who is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: 
in the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed." 
 
"A Lion!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: Queen; "why, he would eat|eat%2:34:00:: us all up." 
 
"Oh, no;" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "this Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Really?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Mouse. 
 
"He says|say%2:32:00:: so himself," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and he would never|never%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%1:12:02:: anyone who is|be%2:42:06:: our friend. If you will help|help%2:41:00:: us to save|save%2:41:01:: him I 
promise|promise%1:10:00:: that he shall treat|treat%2:41:00:: you all with kindness." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Queen, "we will trust|trust%2:31:00:: you. But what shall we do?" 
 
"Are there|there%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: which call|call%2:32:02:: you Queen|queen%1:18:00:: and are|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to 
obey|obey%2:41:00:: you?" 
 
"Oh, yes; there are|be%2:42:00:: thousands," she replied. 
 
"Then send|send%2:38:01:: for them all to come|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, and let|let%2:41:00:: 
each one bring|bring%2:38:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: piece|piece%1:06:00:: of string." 
 
The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: to the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: that attended|attend%2:41:00:: her and told|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: at 
once|once%4:02:00:: and get|get%2:35:03:: all her people. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they heard|hear%2:39:00:: her orders|order%1:10:03:: they 
ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: in every direction|direction%1:15:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as possible. 
 
"Now," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you must go|go%2:38:00:: to those 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: by the river-side and make|make%2:36:01:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: that will carry|carry%2:35:02:: the Lion." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: went|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:00:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to work; and he 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: out of the limbs|limb%1:20:00:: of trees, from which he chopped|chop%2:35:01:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: all the leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: and branches. He fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: it together|together%4:02:02:: with 
wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pegs|peg%2:35:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: the four wheels|wheel%1:06:00:: out of short|short%3:00:01:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: 
tree-trunk. So|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: and so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: he work|work%2:41:02:: that by the time|time%1:11:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to arrive|arrive%2:38:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: all ready|ready%3:00:00:: for them. 
 
They came|come%2:38:00:: from all directions, and there were|be%2:42:03:: thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of them: big|big%3:00:01:: 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and middle-sized mice; and each one brought|bring%2:38:00:: a 
piece|piece%1:11:00:: of string|string%1:06:00:: in his mouth. It was|be%2:42:04:: about this time|time%1:11:00:: that Dorothy woke|wake%2:29:01:: 
from her long|long%3:00:02:: sleep|sleep%1:26:00:: and opened|open%2:35:00:: her eyes. She was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: herself lying|lie%2:35:00:: upon the grass, with thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of mice|mouse%1:05:00:: standing|stand%2:42:02:: 
around|around%4:02:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at her timidly. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her about 
everything, and turning|turn%2:38:00:: to the dignified|dignified%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Mouse, he said, 
 
"Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the Queen." 
 
Dorothy nodded|nod%2:32:00:: gravely|gravely%4:02:00:: and the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: made|make%2:41:00:: a courtesy, after which she 
became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: with the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to fasten|fasten%2:35:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: to the 
truck, using|use%2:34:01:: the strings|string%1:06:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: brought. One end|end%1:15:00:: of a string|string%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
tied|tie%2:35:00:: around the neck|neck%1:08:00:: of each mouse|mouse%1:05:00:: and the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to the truck. 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a thousand times|time%1:28:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than any of the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
who were|be%2:42:03:: to draw|draw%2:35:01:: it; but when all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: they 
were|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to pull|pull%2:35:00:: it quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. Even|even%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could sit|sit%2:35:00:: on it, and were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:06:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: by their queer|queer%1:18:00:: little|little%4:02:00:: 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: to the place|place%1:15:00:: where the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: asleep. 
 
 
 
After a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heavy, they managed|manage%2:41:08:: 
to get|get%2:30:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: on the truck. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: hurriedly|hurriedly%4:02:00:: gave|give%2:40:02:: her people|people%1:14:01:: 
the order|order%1:10:03:: to start, for she feared|fear%2:37:03:: if the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: stayed|stay%2:42:02:: among the 
poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: they also|also%4:02:00:: would fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep. 
 
 
 
At first|first%4:02:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: creatures, many|many%3:00:00:: though they were, could hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: 
the heavily|heavily%4:02:00:: loaded|loaded%3:00:00:full:00 truck; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: both pushed|push%2:41:00:: 
from behind, and they got|get%2:30:00:: along better. Soon|soon%4:02:00:: they rolled|roll%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed|bed%1:06:01:: to the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields, where he could breathe|breathe%2:29:00:: the sweet, 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: again, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the poisonous|poisonous%3:00:00:toxic:00 scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
Dorothy came|come%2:38:00:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: warmly|warmly%4:02:00:: for 
saving|save%2:41:01:: her companion|companion%1:18:00:: from death. She had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the big|big%3:00:00:conspicuous:00 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: rescued. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: unharnessed from the truck|truck%1:06:00:: and scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to their homes. The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the last|last%3:00:00:: 
to leave. 
 
"If ever|ever%4:02:04:: you need|need%2:42:00:: us again," she said, "come out|out%4:02:04:: into the field|field%1:15:00:: and 
call, and we shall hear|hear%2:39:00:: you and come|come%2:38:04:: to your assistance. Good|good%1:06:00:: bye!" 
 
"Good bye!" they all answered, and away|away%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: ran, while Dorothy 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: lest he should run|run%2:38:00:: after her and frighten her. 
 
After this they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: until he should awaken; and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: Dorothy some fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: from a tree|tree%1:20:00:: near by, which 
she ate|eat%2:34:00:: for her dinner. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: X. 
 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: some time|time%1:28:05:: before the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: awakened, for he had|have%2:39:06:: lain|lie%2:35:00:: 
among the poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: while, breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: in their deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fragrance; 
but when he did|do%2:41:01:: open|open%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and roll|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: himself still|still%4:02:01:: alive. 
 
"I ran|run%2:38:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as I could," he said, sitting|sit%2:38:00:: down and yawning; "but 
the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: for me. How did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:30:00:: me out?" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they told|tell%2:32:01:: him of the field-mice, and how they had|have%2:40:00:: generously|generously%4:02:00:: 
saved|save%2:41:01:: him from death; and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: laughed, and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: myself very|very%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: and terrible; yet|yet%4:02:02:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:06:01:: as flowers|flower%1:20:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: near to killing|kill%2:35:00:: me, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: as 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How strange|strange%3:00:00:: it all is! But, comrades, what 
shall we do|do%2:36:01:: now?" 
 
"We must journey|journey%1:04:00:: on until we find|find%2:40:02:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: again," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "and then|then%4:02:00:: we can keep|keep%2:42:07:: on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
So, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: fully|fully%4:02:02:: refreshed, and feeling|feeling%1:09:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: himself again, 
they all started|start%2:30:00:: upon the journey, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: enjoying|enjoy%2:37:00:: the walk|walk%1:04:03:: through 
the soft, fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: grass; and it was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: before they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: where 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz dwelt. 
 
 
 
The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: and well|well%4:02:00:: paved, now, and the country|country%1:15:01:: about was|be%2:42:03:: 
beautiful; so that the travelers|traveler%1:18:00:: rejoiced|rejoice%2:37:00:: in leaving|leave%2:38:01:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind, and with it the many|many%3:00:00:: dangers|danger%1:26:01:: they had|have%2:39:06:: met|meet%2:38:01:: in its gloomy|gloomy%3:00:00:depressing:00 
shades. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: built|build%2:36:00:: beside the road; but 
these were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green, and when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: house, in 
which a farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: lived, that also|also%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green. They 
passed|pass%2:38:05:: by several|several%3:00:00:some:00 of these houses|house%1:06:00:: during the afternoon, and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to the doors|door%1:06:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at them as if they would like|like%2:37:01:: to 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: questions; but no one|one%1:23:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near them nor spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them because of 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion, of which they were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: afraid. The people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in clothing|clothing%1:06:00:: of a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 emerald green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: peaked|peaked%3:00:00:ill:01 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: like those of the Munchkins. 
 
 
 
"This must be|be%2:42:06:: the Land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "and we are|be%2:42:06:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: 
getting|get%2:30:00:: near the Emerald City." 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "everything is|be%2:42:03:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 here, while in 
the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:loved:00 color. But the 
people|people%1:14:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: as the Munchkins and I'm afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 
we shall be|be%2:42:03:: unable|unable%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a place|place%1:15:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"I should like|like%2:37:01:: something to eat|eat%2:34:00:: besides fruit," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: Toto is|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: starved. Let|let%1:14:00:: us stop|stop%2:38:00:: at the next|next%3:00:00:close:01 house|house%1:06:00:: and 
talk|talk%2:32:01:: to the people." 
 
So, when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 sized|size%2:30:00:: farm|farm%1:06:00:: house, Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: 
up to the door|door%1:06:00:: and knocked. A|a%1:10:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: it just|just%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: 
out, and said, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you want, child, and why is|be%2:42:03:: that great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: with you?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with you, if you will allow|allow%2:32:00:: us," answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
Dorothy; "and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my friend|friend%1:18:00:: and comrade, and would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: 
you for the world." 
 
"Is he tame?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the woman, opening|open%2:35:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: wider. 
 
"Oh, yes;" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and he is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 coward, too; so that he 
will be|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of you than you are|be%2:42:03:: of him." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the woman, after thinking|think%2:31:00:: it over and taking|take%2:34:00:: another 
peep|peep%1:04:00:: at the Lion, "if that is|be%2:42:06:: the case|case%1:09:00:: you may come|come%2:38:00:: in, and I will 
give|give%2:40:00:: you some supper|supper%1:13:00:: and a place|place%1:15:00:: to sleep." 
 
So they all entered|enter%2:38:00:: the house, where there|there%4:02:00:: were, besides the woman, 
two children|child%1:18:00:: and a man. The man|man%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: his leg, and was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the 
couch|couch%1:06:00:: in a corner. They seemed|seem%2:39:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: a 
company, and while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: laying|lay%2:35:01:: the table|table%1:06:01:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:03:: you all going?" 
 
"To the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz." 
 
"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man. "Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: that Oz will see|see%2:38:00:: you?" 
 
"Why not?" she replied. 
 
"Why, it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: that he never|never%4:02:00:: lets|let%2:41:00:: any one come|come%2:38:00:: into his presence. I 
have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: times, and it is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and 
wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place; but I have|have%2:41:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: permitted|permit%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz, 
nor do|do%2:41:01:: I know|know%2:31:00:: of any living|live%2:42:00:: person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"Does he never|never%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: out?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Never. He sits|sit%2:35:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: after day|day%1:28:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: of his palace, 
and even|even%4:02:00:: those who wait|wait%2:42:00:: upon him do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: him face|face%2:38:00:: to face." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:03:: he like?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to tell," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wizard, and can take|take%2:30:01:: on|on%4:02:00:: any form|form%1:09:00:: he wishes. So|so%4:02:02:: that some say|say%2:32:01:: he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: like a bird; and some say|say%2:32:01:: he looks|look%2:42:02:: like an elephant; and some 
say|say%2:32:00:: he looks|look%2:39:01:: like a cat. To others he appears|appear%2:39:00:: as a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: fairy, 
or a brownie, or in any other|other%3:00:00:: form|form%1:03:00:: that pleases|please%2:37:00:: him. But who the real|real%1:23:00:: 
Oz is, when he is|be%2:42:03:: in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 form, no living|live%2:42:04:: person|person%1:03:00:: can tell." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:same:02 strange," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "but we must try, in some way, 
to see|see%2:39:02:: him, or we shall have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: our journey|journey%1:04:00:: for nothing." 
 
 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Oz?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, eagerly. 
 
"Oh, Oz could do|do%2:41:01:: that easily|easily%4:02:01:: enough," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the man. "He has|have%2:40:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
brains|brain%1:18:00:: than he needs." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That will not|not%4:02:00:: trouble|trouble%1:11:00:: him," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the man, "for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: a large|large%3:00:00:: 
collection|collection%1:14:00:: of hearts, of all sizes|size%1:07:00:: and shapes." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Oz keeps|keep%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pot|pot%1:23:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: in his throne|throne%1:06:00:: room," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, 
"which he has|have%2:40:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 plate, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: it from running|run%2:38:01:: 
over. He will be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: you some." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: Kansas?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in surprise. 
 
"I don't know," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sorrowfully; "but it is|be%2:42:06:: my home, and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: it's somewhere." 
 
"Very likely. Well, Oz can do|do%2:41:04:: anything; so I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: he will find|find%2:38:10:: 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for you. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must get|get%2:30:00:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him, and that will be|be%2:42:06:: 
a hard|hard%3:00:06:: task; for the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: does|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: anyone, and 
he usually|usually%4:02:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 way. But what do|do%2:41:04:: you want?" he continued, 
speaking|speak%2:32:01:: to Toto. Toto only|only%4:02:01:: wagged|wag%2:38:00:: his tail; for, strange|strange%3:00:00:: to say, he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: speak. 
 
 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: called|call%2:32:09:: to them that supper|supper%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready, so they gathered|gather%2:41:00:: 
around the table|table%1:06:01:: and Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: some delicious|delicious%3:00:00:tasty:00 porridge|porridge%1:13:00:: and a dish|dish%1:06:00:: of 
scrambled|scramble%2:35:02:: eggs|egg%1:13:00:: and a plate|plate%1:23:00:: of nice|nice%3:00:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: bread, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: her meal. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: some of the porridge, but did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:00:: for it, saying|say%2:32:00:: it 
was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:11:: from oats|oat%1:13:00:: and oats|oat%1:13:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: food|food%1:03:00:: for horses, not|not%4:02:00:: for lions. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: at all. Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: of 
everything, and was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: a good|good%3:00:01:: supper|supper%1:13:00:: again. 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: gave|give%2:40:00:: Dorothy a bed|bed%1:06:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: in, and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside 
her, while the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: of her room|room%1:06:00:: so she might not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
disturbed. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a corner|corner%1:15:02:: and 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: quiet|quiet%3:00:02:: all night, although of course|course%1:17:00:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: up, they started|start%2:30:00:: on their 
way, and soon|soon%4:02:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: in the sky|sky%1:17:00:: just|just%4:02:04:: before them. 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
As they walked|walk%2:38:00:: on, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: brighter and brighter, and it 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they were|be%2:42:03:: nearing|near%2:38:00:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of their travels. Yet it 
was|be%2:42:03:: afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: before they came|come%2:38:04:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: the 
City. It was|be%2:42:03:: high, and thick, and of a bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color. 
 
In front|front%1:15:00:: of them, and at the end|end%1:15:00:: of the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, was|be%2:42:05:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
gate, all studded|stud%2:42:00:: with emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: that glittered|glitter%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: that even|even%4:02:00:: 
the painted|painted%3:00:00:artificial:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by their brilliancy. 
 
There was|be%2:42:04:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed|push%2:38:02:: the button|button%1:06:01:: and 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: a silvery|silvery%3:00:00:bright:00 tinkle|tinkle%1:11:00:: sound|sound%1:09:00:: within. Then|then%4:02:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: gate|gate%1:06:00:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
open, and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through and found|find%2:39:05:: themselves in a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: room, the walls|wall%1:06:00:: of which glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: with countless|countless%3:00:00:incalculable:00 emeralds. 
 
Before them stood|stand%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: about the same|same%3:00:00:: size|size%1:07:00:: as the Munchkins. 
He was|be%2:42:03:: clothed|clothe%2:29:00:: all in green, from his head|head%1:08:00:: to his feet, and even|even%4:02:00:: his 
skin|skin%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: of a greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint. At his side|side%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:05:: a large|large%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box. 
 
When he saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: in the Emerald City?" 
 
"We came|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The man|man%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: surprised|surprised%3:00:00:: at this answer|answer%1:10:00:: that he sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it 
over. 
 
"It has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: since anyone asked|ask%2:32:01:: me to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz," he said, 
shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in perplexity. "He is|be%2:42:03:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: and terrible, and if 
you come|come%2:38:04:: on an idle|idle%3:00:00:frivolous:00 or foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand|errand%1:04:00:: to bother|bother%2:41:01:: the wise|wise%3:00:00:: reflections|reflection%1:09:00:: of 
the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Wizard, he might be|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: you all in an instant." 
 
 
 
"But it is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand, nor an idle|idle%3:00:00:: one," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow; "it is|be%2:42:03:: important. And we have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: told|tell%2:32:01:: that Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:reputable:00 
Wizard." 
 
"So he is," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man; "and he rules|rule%2:41:00:: the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: wisely|wisely%4:02:00:: 
and well. But to those who are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: honest, or who approach|approach%2:32:00:: him from 
curiosity, he is|be%2:42:03:: most|most%4:02:01:: terrible, and few|few%3:00:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: dared|dare%2:41:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
his face. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates, and since you demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz I must take|take%2:38:09:: you to his palace. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must put|put%2:35:00:: on 
the spectacles." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Because if you did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:04:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: the brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: and glory|glory%1:07:00:: of 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: would blind|blind%3:00:00:: you. Even|even%4:02:00:: those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:01:: 
must wear|wear%2:29:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day. They are|be%2:42:03:: all locked|lock%2:35:01:: on, for Oz 
so|so%4:02:05:: ordered|order%2:32:00:: it when the City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: first|first%3:00:00:: built, and I have|have%2:40:00:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 key|key%1:06:00:: 
that will unlock|unlock%2:35:00:: them." 
 
 
 
He opened|open%2:35:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: box, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: of every size|size%1:07:00:: and shape. All of them had|have%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: 
in them. The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the gates|gate%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: that would just|just%4:02:00:: fit|fit%2:42:02:: 
Dorothy and put|put%2:35:00:: them over her eyes. There were|be%2:42:04:: two golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 bands|band%1:06:00:: 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: to them that passed|pass%2:42:08:: around the back|back%1:06:00:: of her head, where they 
were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: by a little|little%3:00:01:: key|key%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:05:: at the end|end%1:15:00:: of a chain|chain%1:06:00:: the 
Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: around his neck. When they were|be%2:42:03:: on, Dorothy 
could not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: she wished, but of course|course%1:15:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:34:00:: 
to be|be%2:42:03:: blinded|blind%2:39:01:: by the glare|glare%1:07:00:: of the Emerald City, so she said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man|man%1:18:00:: fitted|fitted%3:44:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: for the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and even|even%4:02:00:: on little|little%3:00:01:: Toto; and all were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:02:: with the key. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: put|put%2:35:00:: on his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: and told|tell%2:32:04:: them 
he was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to show|show%2:32:01:: them to the palace. Taking|take%2:35:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 key|key%1:06:00:: from 
a peg|peg%2:35:00:: on the wall|wall%1:06:00:: he opened|open%2:35:00:: another gate, and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him 
through the portal|portal%1:06:01:: into the streets|street%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XI. 
 
 
Even|even%4:02:00:: with eyes|eye%1:08:00:: protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: Dorothy and her 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: at first|first%4:02:02:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by the brilliancy|brilliancy%1:07:00:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 City. 
The streets|street%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lined|line%2:35:00:: with beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: all built|build%2:36:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
and studded|stud%2:42:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: with sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 emeralds. They walked|walk%2:38:00:: over a 
pavement|pavement%1:06:01:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble, and where the blocks|block%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: joined|join%2:35:01:: 
together|together%4:02:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: rows|row%1:14:00:: of emeralds, set|set%2:35:02:: closely, and glittering in the 
brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: of the sun. The window|window%1:06:04:: panes|pane%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glass; even|even%4:02:00:: the 
sky|sky%1:17:00:: above the City|city%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint, and the rays|ray%1:19:00:: of the sun|sun%1:17:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: green. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: people, men, women|woman%1:18:00:: and children, walking|walking%1:04:00:: about, and 
these were|be%2:42:03:: all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and had|have%2:40:00:: greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 skins. They 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy and her strangely|strangely%4:02:01:: assorted|assorted%3:00:00:heterogeneous:00 company|company%1:26:00:: with wondering|wonder%2:32:12:: 
eyes, and the children|child%1:18:00:: all ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: behind their mothers|mother%1:18:00:: when 
they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Lion; but no one|one%1:23:00:: spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them. Many|many%3:00:00:: shops|shop%1:06:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the 
street, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that everything in them was|be%2:42:03:: green. Green|green%1:07:00:: 
candy|candy%1:13:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pop-corn were|be%2:42:03:: offered|offer%2:40:00:: for sale, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:08:: as green|green%1:07:00:: 
shoes, green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hats|hat%1:06:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of all sorts. At one place|place%1:15:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: selling|sell%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lemonade, and when the children|child%1:18:00:: bought|buy%2:40:00:: it Dorothy 
could see|see%2:39:00:: that they paid|pay%2:40:00:: for it with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pennies. 
 
There seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:04:: no horses|horse%1:05:00:: nor animals|animal%1:03:00:: of any kind; the men|man%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: 
things|thing%1:06:00:: around|around%4:02:06:: in little|little%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carts, which they pushed|push%2:38:00:: before them. 
Everyone seemed|seem%2:39:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and contented|contented%3:00:00:: and prosperous. 
 
The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:00:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:00:: to a big|big%3:00:01:: building, exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the City, which was|be%2:42:05:: 
the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard. There was|be%2:42:04:: a soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: before the 
door, dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 uniform|uniform%1:06:00:: and wearing|wear%2:29:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 beard. 
 
"Here are|be%2:42:04:: strangers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: to him, "and 
they demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz." 
 
"Step inside," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and I will carry|carry%2:35:02:: your message|message%1:10:01:: 
to him." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the Palace|palace%1:14:00:: gates|gate%1:06:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: led|lead%2:38:01:: into a big|big%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: 
with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: and lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 furniture|furniture%1:06:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: with emeralds. 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: them all wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: their feet|foot%1:08:01:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 mat|mat%1:06:00:: before 
entering|enter%2:38:00:: this room, and when they were|be%2:42:03:: seated|seat%2:35:00:: he said, politely, 
 
"Please make|make%2:30:00:: yourselves comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: while I go|go%2:38:00:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: of the 
Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:00:: Oz you are|be%2:42:05:: here." 
 
They had|have%2:40:01:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: before the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: returned. When, at 
last, he came|come%2:38:00:: back, Dorothy asked, 
 
"Have you seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz?" 
 
 
 
"Oh, no;" returned|return%2:32:01:: the soldier; "I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him. But I spoke|speak%2:32:00:: 
to him as he sat|sit%2:42:00:: behind his screen, and gave|give%2:40:00:: him your message. He 
says|say%2:32:00:: he will grant|grant%2:40:01:: you an audience, if you so|so%4:02:05:: desire; but each one 
of you must enter|enter%2:38:00:: his presence|presence%1:15:00:: alone, and he will admit|admit%2:41:01:: but one each 
day. Therefore, as you must remain|remain%2:42:03:: in the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 days, I 
will have|have%2:30:00:: you shown|show%2:38:00:: to rooms|room%1:06:00:: where you may rest|rest%2:32:00:: in comfort|comfort%1:26:00:: after your 
journey." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the girl; "that is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 kind|kind%1:09:00:: of Oz." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: blew|blow%2:29:00:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whistle, and at once|once%4:02:02:: a young|young%3:00:00:: girl, 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, entered|enter%2:38:00:: the room. She had|have%2:42:00:: 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 eyes, and she bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy as 
she said, 
 
"Follow me and I will show|show%2:32:01:: you your room." 
 
So Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye to all her friends|friend%1:18:00:: except Toto, and taking|take%2:31:03:: 
the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: through seven passages|passage%1:08:00:: 
and up|up%4:02:00:: three flights|flight%1:06:00:: of stairs|stair%1:06:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a room|room%1:06:00:: at the front|front%1:15:00:: 
of the Palace. It was|be%2:42:03:: the sweetest|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: in the world, with 
a soft, comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: that had|have%2:42:00:: sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: and a green|green%1:07:00:: 
velvet|velvet%1:06:00:: counterpane. There was|be%2:42:04:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 fountain|fountain%1:06:02:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the 
room, that shot|shoot%2:38:03:: a spray|spray%1:11:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 perfume|perfume%1:06:00:: into the air, to fall|fall%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: 
into a beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved|carve%2:35:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: basin. Beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the windows, and there was|be%2:42:04:: a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: with a row|row%1:14:00:: of little|little%3:00:01:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 books. When Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to open|open%2:35:00:: these books|book%1:06:00:: she found|find%2:40:02:: them 
full|full%3:00:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pictures|picture%1:06:00:: that made|make%2:32:00:: her laugh, they were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: funny. 
 
In a wardrobe|wardrobe%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 dresses, made|make%2:42:05:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and satin|satin%1:06:00:: and 
velvet; and all of them fitted|fit%2:42:05:: Dorothy exactly. 
 
"Make yourself perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: at home," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "and if you 
wish|wish%1:10:01:: for anything ring|ring%1:11:00:: the bell. Oz will send|send%2:32:00:: for you to-morrow 
morning." 
 
She left|leave%2:31:05:: Dorothy alone|alone%4:02:01:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the others. These she also|also%4:02:00:: 
led|lead%2:38:01:: to rooms, and each one of them found|find%2:39:01:: himself lodged|lodge%2:42:00:: in a very|very%4:02:00:: 
pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: part|part%1:24:00:: of the Palace. Of course|course%1:15:00:: this politeness|politeness%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: wasted|waste%2:34:05:: on 
the Scarecrow; for when he found|find%2:39:05:: himself alone|alone%4:02:01:: in his room|room%1:06:00:: he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
stupidly|stupidly%4:02:00:: in one spot, just|just%4:02:05:: within the doorway, to wait|wait%2:42:00:: till morning. 
It would not|not%4:02:00:: rest|rest%2:32:01:: him to lie|lie%2:38:00:: down, and he could not|not%4:02:00:: close|close%2:35:00:: his eyes; 
so|so%4:02:09:: he remained|remain%2:42:03:: all night|night%1:28:00:: staring|star%2:30:00:: at a little|little%3:00:01:: spider|spider%1:05:00:: which was|be%2:42:03:: weaving|weave%2:36:00:: 
its web|web%1:06:00:: in a corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the room, just|just%4:02:05:: as if it were|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: one of the 
most|most%4:02:01:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: in the world. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his 
bed|bed%1:06:00:: from force|force%1:04:00:: of habit, for he remembered|remember%2:31:00:: when he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh; 
but not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: he passed|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: moving|move%2:38:01:: his joints|joint%1:08:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
and down|down%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 they kept|keep%2:42:07:: in good|good%3:00:01:: working|work%2:35:02:: order. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would 
have|have%2:40:00:: preferred|prefer%2:37:00:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in the forest, and did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: 
being|be%2:42:03:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a room; but he had|have%2:40:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: sense|sense%1:09:04:: to let|let%2:41:00:: this worry|worry%1:09:00:: 
him, so he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: upon the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: like a cat|cat%1:05:00:: and 
purred|purr%2:32:00:: himself asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: in a minute. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, after breakfast, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to fetch|fetch%2:35:00:: 
Dorothy, and she dressed|dress%2:29:01:: her in one of the prettiest|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 gowns--made of 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brocaded|brocaded%3:00:00:adorned:00 satin. Dorothy put|put%2:35:05:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: apron|apron%1:06:00:: and tied|tie%2:35:00:: a 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck, and they started|start%2:38:02:: for the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: 
of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
 
 
First|first%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 hall|hall%1:06:02:: in which were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: ladies|lady%1:18:01:: and 
gentlemen|gentleman%1:18:00:: of the court, all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in rich|rich%3:00:00:: costumes. These people|people%1:14:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but talk|talk%2:32:01:: to each other, but they always|always%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to 
wait|wait%2:42:00:: outside the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: every morning, although they were|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: 
permitted|permit%2:41:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: As Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: at her curiously, 
and one of them whispered, 
 
"Are you really|really%4:02:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon the face|face%1:08:00:: of Oz the Terrible?" 
 
"Of course," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl, "if he will see|see%2:41:11:: me." 
 
"Oh, he will see|see%2:38:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: her message|message%1:10:01:: 
to the Wizard, "although he does|do%2:36:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to have|have%2:40:00:: people|people%1:14:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
him. Indeed, at first|first%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: I should send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: 
where you came|come%2:42:09:: from. Then|then%4:02:00:: he asked|ask%2:32:00:: me what you looked|look%2:39:01:: like, and when 
I mentioned|mention%2:32:02:: your silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: interested. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him about the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead, and he decided|decide%2:31:00:: he would 
admit|admit%2:41:01:: you to his presence." 
 
Just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: rang, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: the signal. You must go|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: alone." 
 
She opened|open%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: door|door%1:06:00:: and Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: through and found|find%2:30:13:: 
herself in a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place. It was|be%2:42:03:: a big, round|round%1:13:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: with a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: roof, and the walls|wall%1:06:00:: and ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and floor|floor%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with 
large|large%3:00:00:: emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: closely|closely%4:02:00:: together. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the roof|roof%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 light, as|as%4:02:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as the sun, which made|make%2:30:00:: the emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: sparkle|sparkle%1:07:00:: in 
a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 manner. 
 
But what interested|interest%2:42:00:: Dorothy most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
that stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the room. It was|be%2:42:03:: shaped|shape%2:30:00:: like a chair|chair%1:06:00:: 
and sparkled|sparkle%2:43:00:: with gems, as did|do%2:36:01:: everything else. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the 
chair|chair%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: an enormous|enormous%3:00:00:large:00 Head, without body|body%1:08:01:: to support|support%2:35:00:: it or any arms|arm%1:08:00:: or 
legs|leg%1:08:02:: whatever. There was|be%2:42:04:: no hair|hair%1:08:00:: upon this head, but it had|have%2:40:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and 
nose|nose%1:08:00:: and mouth, and was|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the head|head%1:08:00:: of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: giant. 
 
As Dorothy gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon this in wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: and fear|fear%2:37:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply|sharply%4:02:02:: and steadily. Then|then%4:02:00:: the mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: moved, and 
Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: a voice|voice%1:10:00:: say: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an awful|awful%3:00:00:bad:00 voice|voice%1:07:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to come|come%2:42:04:: from the 
big|big%3:00:01:: Head; so she took|take%2:41:04:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: and answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy, the Small|small%1:08:00:: and Meek. I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: to you for help." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: for a full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 minute. Then|then%4:02:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: the 
voice: 
 
"Where did|do%2:36:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes?" 
 
"I got|get%2:40:00:: them from the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the East, when my house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: on 
her and killed|kill%2:35:00:: her," she replied. 
 
"Where did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead?" continued|continue%2:42:01:: the voice. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: where the good|good%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: me when she bade|bid%2:32:00:: me 
good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: and sent|send%2:38:01:: me to you," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
Again|again%4:02:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply, and they saw|saw%2:35:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: telling|tell%2:32:04:: 
the truth. Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:00:: me to do?" 
 
"Send me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, where my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: are," she 
answered, earnestly. "I don't like your country, although it is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
beautiful. And I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: will be|be%2:42:03:: dreadfully|dreadfully%4:02:00:: worried|worry%2:37:00:: over my 
being|be%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:29:00:: three times, and then|then%4:02:00:: they turned|turn%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and 
down|down%4:02:00:: to the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: queerly|queerly%4:02:01:: that they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room. And at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 they looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy again. 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and I am|be%2:42:03:: weak; because you are|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: 
and I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a helpless|helpless%3:00:01:powerless:00 little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," she answered. 
 
"But you were|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"That just|just%4:02:01:: happened," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, simply; "I could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head, "I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my answer. You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: 
to expect|expect%2:32:00:: me to send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: unless you do|do%2:41:01:: something for 
me in return. In this country|country%1:14:01:: everyone must pay|pay%2:40:00:: for everything he 
gets. If you wish|wish%2:37:02:: me to use|use%2:34:01:: my magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 power|power%1:07:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: you home|home%1:15:02:: again|again%4:02:00:: you 
must do|do%2:41:01:: something for me first. Help|help%2:41:00:: me and I will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"What must I|i%1:27:00:: do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Kill the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"But I cannot!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised. 
 
"You killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and you wear|wear%2:29:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes, 
which bear|bear%2:42:14:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm. There is|be%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:00:: but one Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: 
in all this land, and when you can tell|tell%2:32:00:: me she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will send|send%2:35:00:: 
you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas--but not|not%4:02:00:: before." 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep, she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed; and the 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: upon her anxiously, as if the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz 
felt|feel%2:31:00:: that she could help|help%2:41:00:: him if she would. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything, willingly," she sobbed; "and even|even%4:02:00:: if I wanted|want%2:37:00:: 
to, how could I kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch? If you, who are|be%2:42:06:: Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 and 
Terrible, cannot kill|kill%2:35:00:: her yourself, how do|do%2:41:01:: you expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to do|do%2:41:01:: it?" 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head; "but that is|be%2:42:06:: my answer, and until the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:offensive:01 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: dies|die%2:30:00:: you will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: your Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: again. Remember|remember%2:31:01:: 
that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be|be%2:42:03:: killed. 
Now|now%4:02:02:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:04:: your task." 
 
Sorrowfully Dorothy left|leave%2:38:01:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: where the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: what 
Oz had|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to her. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no hope|hope%1:09:00:: for me," she said, sadly, "for Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: me 
home|home%1:15:04:: until I have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West; and that I can 
never|never%4:02:00:: do." 
 
Her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: sorry, but could do|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: her; so she went|go%2:38:01:: 
to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 room|room%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: herself to sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and said, 
 
"Come with me, for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and was|be%2:42:03:: admitted|admit%2:41:01:: into the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room, where he saw, sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in the emerald throne, a most|most%4:02:01:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady. She was|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gauze|gauze%1:06:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: upon her flowing|flow%2:35:04:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 locks|lock%1:08:00:: a crown|crown%1:06:02:: of jewels. Growing|grow%2:30:02:: from her shoulders|shoulder%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: wings, 
gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: and so|so%4:02:02:: light|light%3:00:01:: that they fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: if the slightest|slight%3:00:00:insignificant:00 
breath|breath%1:19:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: them. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: bowed, as|as%4:02:00:: prettily|prettily%4:02:00:: as his straw|straw%1:27:00:: stuffing|stuff%2:30:02:: would 
let|let%2:41:00:: him, before this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: creature, she looked|look%2:39:00:: upon him sweetly, 
and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, who had|have%2:39:06:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head|head%1:18:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him of, was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: astonished; but he answered|answer%2:32:00:: her bravely. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a Scarecrow, stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
brains, and I come|come%2:38:00:: to you praying|pray%2:32:00:: that you will put|put%2:35:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in my head|head%1:09:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:01:: of straw, so that I may become|become%2:42:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any other|other%3:00:00:: in 
your dominions." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the lady. 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: and powerful, and no one|one%1:23:00:: else can help|help%2:41:00:: me," 
answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:40:05:: favors|favor%1:04:00:: without some return," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "but this much|much%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will promise. If you will kill|kill%2:35:00:: for me the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:01:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will bestow|bestow%2:40:00:: upon you a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: brains, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 good|good%3:00:01:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: that 
you will be|be%2:42:03:: the wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: you asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," said, the Scarecrow, 
in surprise. 
 
 
 
"So I did. I don't care|care%1:12:01:: who kills|kill%2:35:00:: her. But until she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will 
not|not%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:32:00:: your wish. Now|now%1:28:00:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seek|seek%2:35:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: 
earned|earn%2:40:03:: the brains|brain%1:09:00:: you so|so%4:02:02:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: desire." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: and told|tell%2:32:01:: them what 
Oz had|have%2:42:00:: said; and Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: that the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Head, as she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him, but a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "she needs|need%2:34:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: as the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman." 
 
On the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and said, 
 
"Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you. Follow|follow%2:38:00:: me," 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and came|come%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. He 
did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: whether he would find|find%2:31:10:: Oz a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: or a Head, but 
he hoped|hop%2:38:03:: it would be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. "For," he said|say%2:32:00:: to himself, "if 
it is|be%2:42:06:: the Head, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:03:: a heart, since a head|head%1:08:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: of its own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 and therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: cannot feel|feel%1:26:00:: for me. But if it 
is|be%2:42:03:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: I shall beg|beg%2:32:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: for a heart, for all ladies|lady%1:18:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: 
themselves said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: hearted." 
 
But when the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he saw|saw%2:35:00:: neither 
the Head|head%1:08:00:: nor the Lady, for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the shape|shape%1:09:00:: of a most|most%4:02:01:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 
Beast. It was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as an elephant, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to hold|hold%2:35:01:: its weight. The Beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a head|head%1:08:00:: 
like that of a rhinoceros, only|only%4:02:06:: there were|be%2:42:04:: five eyes|eye%1:08:00:: in its face. 
There were|be%2:42:04:: five long|long%3:00:01:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:02:: out of its body|body%1:08:01:: and it also|also%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
five long, slim|slim%3:00:00:thin:03 legs. Thick, woolly|woolly%3:00:00:soft:01 hair|hair%1:08:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: every part|part%1:24:00:: of it, 
and a more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: monster|monster%1:18:02:: could not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: imagined. It was|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: at that moment, for it would 
have|have%2:42:00:: beat|beat%2:38:00:: loud|loud%4:02:00:: and fast|fast%4:02:01:: from terror. But being|be%2:42:03:: only|only%3:00:00:single:05 tin, the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all afraid, although he was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed. 
 
"I am Oz, the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 and Terrible," spake the Beast, in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: that 
was|be%2:42:03:: one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar. "Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Woodman, and made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and cannot 
love. I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that I may be|be%2:42:06:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: the Beast. 
 
"Because I ask|ask%2:32:01:: it, and you alone|alone%4:02:00:: can grant|grant%2:40:03:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman. 
 
Oz gave|give%2:41:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 growl|growl%1:11:00:: at this, but said, gruffly, 
 
"If you indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: desire|desire%2:37:00:: a heart, you must earn|earn%2:40:03:: it." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"Help Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Beast. "When the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, come|come%2:30:03:: to me, and I will then|then%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you 
the biggest|big%3:00:01:: and kindest|kind%3:00:00:: and most|most%4:02:00:: loving|loving%3:00:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:41:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: 
and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them of the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: seen. They all wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: at the many|many%3:00:00:: forms|form%1:09:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: could take|take%2:30:01:: upon himself, 
and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said, 
 
 
 
"If he is|be%2:42:03:: a beast|beast%1:03:00:: when I go|go%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: him, I shall roar|roar%1:10:00:: my loudest, and 
so|so%4:02:05:: frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: him that he will grant|grant%2:32:00:: all I|i%1:23:00:: ask. And if he is|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady, I shall pretend|pretend%2:32:01:: to spring|spring%2:38:01:: upon her, and so|so%4:02:05:: compel|compel%2:41:00:: her to do|do%2:36:01:: my 
bidding. And if he is|be%2:42:03:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Head, he will be|be%2:42:03:: at my mercy; for I 
will roll|roll%2:38:00:: this head|head%1:08:00:: all about the room|room%1:06:00:: until he promises|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: us 
what we desire. So|so%4:02:05:: be|be%2:42:03:: of good|good%3:00:01:: cheer|cheer%1:07:00:: my friends|friend%1:18:00:: for all will yet|yet%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
well." 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: to 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and bade|bid%2:32:00:: him enter|enter%2:38:00:: the presence|presence%1:15:00:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the door, and glancing|glance%2:39:00:: around saw, to 
his surprise, that before the throne|throne%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 
and glowing|glowing%3:00:00:enthusiastic:00 he could scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: to gaze|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it. His first|first%3:00:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: that Oz had|have%2:42:00:: by accident|accident%1:11:00:: caught|catch%2:30:00:: on fire|fire%1:22:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: burning|burn%2:30:01:: up; but, 
when he tried|try%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: nearer, the heat|heat%1:07:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: intense|intense%3:00:00:: that it singed|sing%2:32:08:: 
his whiskers, and he crept|creep%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: tremblingly to a spot|spot%1:15:01:: nearer the door. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: a low, quiet|quiet%3:00:00:soft:04 voice|voice%1:07:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: from the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, and these were|be%2:42:06:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: it spoke: 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:41:01:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: 
me?" And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of everything. I come|come%2:38:00:: to you to beg|beg%2:32:00:: 
that you give|give%2:40:03:: me courage, so that in reality|reality%1:26:01:: I may become|become%2:42:01:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of 
Beasts, as men|man%1:18:00:: call|call%2:32:02:: me." 
 
"Why should I give|give%2:40:03:: you courage?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because of all Wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: you are|be%2:42:06:: the greatest, and alone|alone%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: power|power%1:07:00:: to 
grant|grant%2:32:00:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
The Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: burned|burn%2:43:01:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: for a time, and the voice|voice%1:07:00:: said, 
 
"Bring me proof|proof%1:09:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, and that moment|moment%1:28:00:: I will 
give|give%2:40:03:: you courage. But so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: lives|live%2:42:04:: you must remain|remain%2:30:00:: a 
coward." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: at this speech, but could say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: in reply, 
and while he stood|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: gazing|gaze%2:39:00:: at the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: it became|become%2:42:01:: 
so|so%4:02:09:: furiously|furiously%4:02:01:: hot|hot%3:00:01:: that he turned|turn%2:38:00:: tail|tail%1:08:01:: and rushed|rush%2:38:01:: from the room. He 
was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:39:01:: his friends|friend%1:18:00:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for him, and told|tell%2:32:01:: them of his 
terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 interview|interview%1:10:01:: with the Wizard. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sadly. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:04:00:: we can do," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, "and that 
is|be%2:42:03:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Winkies, seek|seek%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, and 
destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: her." 
 
"But suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we cannot?" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Then I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: courage," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart," spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, 
beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to cry. 
 
"Be careful!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "the tears|tear%1:08:01:: will fall|fall%2:38:03:: on your 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, and spot|spot%1:10:01:: it." 
 
So Dorothy dried|dry%2:30:01:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we must try|try%2:41:01:: it; but I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I do|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
anybody, even|even%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:41:12:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again." 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: with you; but I'm too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a coward|coward%1:18:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: too," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: of much|much%3:00:00::

"I haven't the heart|heart%1:09:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: a Witch," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; 
"but if you go|go%2:38:01:: I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall go|go%2:38:00:: with you." 
 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to start|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
morning, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: sharpened|sharpen%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grindstone|grindstone%1:06:00:: and 
had|have%2:30:00:: all his joints|joint%1:08:00:: properly|properly%4:02:00:: oiled. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: himself with 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: straw|straw%1:27:00:: and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: new|new%3:00:00:: paint|paint%1:06:00:: on his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that he might see|see%2:39:00:: 
better. The green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind|kind%3:00:00:: to them, filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's 
basket|basket%1:06:00:: with good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat, and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: a little|little%3:00:01:: bell|bell%1:06:00:: around 
Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon. 
 
They went|go%2:38:00:: to bed|bed%1:06:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: early|early%3:00:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until daylight, when 
they were|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by the crowing|crowing%1:10:00:: of a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cock|cock%1:05:01:: that lived|live%2:42:08:: in the 
back|back%4:02:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: of the palace, and the cackling of a hen|hen%1:05:01:: that had|have%2:40:00:: laid|lay%2:35:02:: a

The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: of 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: until they reached|reach%2:38:01:: the room|room%1:06:00:: where the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the 
Gates|gate%1:06:00:: lived. This officer|officer%1:18:03:: unlocked|unlock%2:35:00:: their spectacles|spectacle%1:10:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: them back|back%4:02:04:: in 
his great|great%3:00:01:large:00 box, and then|then%4:02:00:: he politely|politely%4:02:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: for our friends. 
 
"Which road|road%1:06:00:: leads|lead%2:38:01:: to the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no road," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates; "no one ever|ever%4:02:04:: 
wishes|wish%1:12:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: that way." 
 
"How, then, are|be%2:42:06:: we to find|find%2:40:00:: her?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
 
 
"That will be|be%2:42:03:: easy," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the man; "for when she knows|know%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: in 
the Country|country%1:15:00:: of the Winkies she will find|find%2:40:00:: you, and make|make%2:30:00:: you all her 
slaves." 
 
"Perhaps not," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for we mean|mean%2:31:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: her." 
 
 
 
"Oh, that is|be%2:42:03:: different," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates. "No one has|have%2:42:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:35:00:: her before, so I naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would make|make%2:41:00:: 
slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of you, as she has|have%2:40:00:: of all the rest. But take|take%2:41:04:: care; for she is|be%2:42:03:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: and fierce, and may not|not%4:02:00:: allow|allow%2:41:00:: you to destroy|destroy%2:33:00:: her. Keep|keep%2:42:00:: to the 
West, where the sun|sun%1:17:00:: sets, and you cannot fail|fail%2:41:02:: to find|find%2:40:00:: her." 
 
They thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him and bade|bid%2:32:01:: him good-bye, and turned|turn%2:38:00:: toward the West, 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: over fields|field%1:15:00:: of soft|soft%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: and there|there%4:02:00:: with daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: 
and buttercups. Dorothy still|still%4:02:01:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: the pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: dress|dress%1:06:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
put|put%2:35:05:: on|on%4:02:00:: in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found|find%2:40:02:: it was|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:01:: green, but pure|pure%3:00:04:: white. The ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: its green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's dress. 
 
The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: behind. As they advanced|advance%2:38:00:: the 
ground|ground%1:27:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: rougher|rough%3:00:00:: and hillier, for there were|be%2:42:00:: no farms|farm%1:06:00:: nor houses|house%1:06:00:: 
in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the West, and the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: untilled. 
 
In the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone hot|hot%3:00:01:: in their faces, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: to offer|offer%2:40:02:: them shade; so|so%4:02:06:: that before night|night%1:28:00:: Dorothy and Toto and 
the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tired, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, 
with the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: keeping|keep%2:31:00:: watch. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: but one eye, yet|yet%4:02:02:: that was|be%2:42:03:: as 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as a telescope, and could see|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. So, as she sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle, she happened|happen%2:30:02:: to look|look%2:39:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy 
lying|lie%2:42:03:: asleep, with her friends|friend%1:18:00:: all about her. They were|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:01:: 
distance|distance%1:12:00:: off, but the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: them in her 
country; so she blew|blow%2:39:05:: upon a silver|silver%1:27:00:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: that hung around her neck. 
 
At once|once%4:02:02:: there came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: to her from all directions|direction%1:15:00:: a pack|pack%1:14:00:: of great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
wolves. They had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: and fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 teeth. 
 
"Go to those people," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, "and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to pieces." 
 
"Are you not|not%4:02:00:: going|go%2:41:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: them your slaves?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the 
wolves. 
 
"No," she answered, "one is|be%2:42:03:: of tin, and one of straw; one is|be%2:42:06:: a girl|girl%1:18:00:: 
and another a Lion. None|none%1:28:00:: of them is|be%2:42:03:: fit|fit%3:00:02:: to work, so you may tear|tear%2:35:01:: them 
into small|small%3:00:00:: pieces." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the wolf, and he dashed|dash%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 speed, 
followed|follow%2:38:00:: by the others. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: awake and heard|hear%2:31:00:: 
the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: coming. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my fight," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so get|get%2:30:00:: behind me and I will 
meet|meet%2:38:01:: them as they come." 
 
He seized|seize%2:35:00:: his axe, which he had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sharp, and as the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
of the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: on the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: his arm|arm%1:08:00:: and chopped|chop%2:35:03:: the 
wolf's head|head%2:42:04:: from its body, so that it immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: died. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he 
could raise|raise%2:38:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: another wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: up, and he also|also%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: under the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's weapon. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty wolves, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: a wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: killed; so that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: in a 
heap|heap%1:23:00:: before the Woodman. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he put|put%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and sat|sit%2:38:00:: beside the Scarecrow, who said, 
 
"It was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: fight, friend." 
 
They waited|wait%2:42:00:: until Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of shaggy wolves, but 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her all. She thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him for saving|save%2:41:01:: them and sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to breakfast, after which they started|start%2:30:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: upon their journey. 
 
 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: this same|same%3:00:02:: morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: with her one eye|eye%1:08:00:: that could see|see%2:39:00:: afar off. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: all 
her wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: dead, and the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: still|still%4:02:01:: travelling|travel%2:38:00:: through her 
country. This made|make%2:30:00:: her angrier|angry%3:00:00:stormy:00 than before, and she blew|blow%2:29:00:: her silver|silver%1:07:00:: 
whistle|whistle%2:32:00:: twice. 
 
Straightway a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: toward her, 
enough|enough%4:02:00:: to darken|darken%2:30:01:: the sky. And the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: to the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow, 
 
"Fly at once|once%4:02:00:: to the strangers; peck|peck%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to 
pieces." 
 
The wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: toward Dorothy and her 
companions. When the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: afraid. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my battle; so lie|lie%1:10:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside me and you will not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: harmed." 
 
So they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: upon the ground|ground%1:17:00:: except the Scarecrow, and he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: and stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his arms. And when the crows|crow%1:05:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: him they were|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened, as these birds|bird%1:05:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: by scarecrows, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:01:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: any nearer. But the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: said, 
 
"It is|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: man. I will peck|peck%2:35:01:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: out." 
 
The King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at the Scarecrow, who caught|catch%2:35:06:: it by the head|head%1:08:00:: and 
twisted|twist%2:35:02:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: until it died. And then|then%4:02:00:: another crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him, 
and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: also. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty crows, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: a neck, until at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 all were|be%2:42:03:: 
lying|lie%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: beside him. Then|then%4:02:00:: he called|call%2:32:09:: to his companions|companion%1:18:00:: to rise, and 
again|again%4:02:00:: they went|go%2:30:01:: upon their journey. 
 
When the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: all her crows|crow%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in 
a heap, she got|get%2:30:00:: into a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 rage, and blew|blow%2:29:00:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon her 
silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 whistle. 
 
 
 
Forthwith there|there%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 buzzing|buzz%2:42:00:: in the air, and a swarm|swarm%1:14:00:: 
of black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: towards her. "Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and 
sting|sting%2:39:00:: them to death!" commanded|command%2:32:00:: the Witch, and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
walking. But the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
decided|decide%2:31:00:: what to do. 
 
"Take out|out%4:02:04:: my straw|straw%1:27:00:: and scatter|scatter%2:35:00:: it over the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
and the lion," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Woodman, "and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot sting|sting%1:26:01:: 
them." This the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: did, and as Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: covered|cover%2:35:01:: them entirely. 
 
The bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: no one|one%1:23:00:: but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to sting, so they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him and broke|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: all their stings|sting%1:26:00:: against the tin, without 
hurting|hurt%2:39:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: at all. And as bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot live|live%4:02:00:: when their stings|sting%1:26:01:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of the black|black%3:00:01:: bees, and they lay|lay%2:35:00:: scattered|scatter%2:30:00:: 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 about the Woodman, like little|little%3:00:01:: heaps|heap%1:23:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: up, and the girl|girl%1:18:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
put|put%2:35:00:: the straw|straw%1:27:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: again, until he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as 
ever. So they started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: once more. 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: her black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: in little|little%3:00:00:young:00 
heaps|heap%1:14:00:: like fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal|coal%1:27:00:: that she stamped|stamp%2:38:00:: her foot|foot%1:08:01:: and tore|tear%2:35:00:: her hair|hair%1:08:00:: and 
gnashed|gnash%2:29:00:: her teeth. And then|then%4:02:00:: she called|call%2:32:05:: a dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of her slaves, who 
were|be%2:42:06:: the Winkies, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 spears, telling|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: them. 
 
The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: people, but they had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: 
told; so they marched|march%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: near to Dorothy. Then|then%4:02:00:: the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:32:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar|roar%1:10:00:: and sprang|spring%2:38:01:: toward them, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Winkies 
were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 that they ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could. 
 
When they returned|return%2:38:00:: to the castle|castle%1:06:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: beat|beat%2:33:00:: them well|well%4:02:03:: 
with a strap, and sent|send%2:38:01:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to their work, after which she sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: what she should do|do%2:41:01:: next. She could not|not%4:02:00:: understand|understand%2:31:00:: how 
all her plans|plan%1:09:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: these strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: failed; but she was|be%2:42:03:: a 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: Witch, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 one, and she soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her 
mind|mind%2:31:02:: how to act. 
 
 
 
There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle|circle%1:25:00:: of diamonds|diamond%1:21:00:: and 
rubies|ruby%1:27:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: round|round%3:00:00:: it. This Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: a charm. Whoever owned|own%2:40:00:: 
it could call|call%2:32:05:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, who would obey|obey%2:41:00:: 
any order|order%1:10:03:: they were|be%2:42:03:: given. But no person|person%1:03:00:: could command|command%2:32:01:: these strange|strange%3:00:00:: 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than three times. Twice|twice%4:02:00:: already|already%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
used|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Cap. Once|once%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: the Winkies her 
slaves, and set|set%2:30:01:: herself to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over|over%4:02:02:: their country. The Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. The second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: fought|fight%2:33:01:: against 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz himself, and driven|drive%2:35:11:: him out of the land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. The 
Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her in doing|do%2:41:01:: this. Only|only%4:02:01:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: could 
she use|use%2:34:01:: this Golden Cap, for which reason|reason%1:16:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to do|do%2:36:01:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
until all her other|other%3:00:00:: powers|power%1:09:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: exhausted. But now|now%4:02:05:: that her fierce|fierce%3:00:00:stormy:00 
wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: and her wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and her stinging|stinging%3:00:00:unkind:00 bees|bee%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gone, and her 
slaves|slave%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: scared|scar%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: by the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, she saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: one way|way%1:04:01:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: Dorothy and her friends. 
 
 
 
So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: took|take%2:30:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: from her cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: 
it upon her head. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her left|leave%2:38:01:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, slowly, "Ep-pe, pep-pe, 
kak-ke!" 
 
Next|next%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her right|right%3:00:00:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" 
 
After this she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon both feet|foot%1:08:01:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice, 
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to work. The sky|sky%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: darkened, and a low|low%3:00:01:: 
rumbling|rumble%2:39:00:: sound|sound%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: in the air. There was|be%2:42:04:: a rushing|rush%2:30:00:: of many|many%3:00:00:: 
wings; a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and laughing; and the sun|sun%1:17:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: out of the 
dark|dark%3:00:02:: sky|sky%1:17:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: by a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: of monkeys, 
each with a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of immense|immense%3:00:01:large:00 and powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: wings|wing%1:05:00:: on his shoulders. 
 
One, much|much%4:02:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the others, seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: their leader. He flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
close|close%4:02:01:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and said, 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:05:: us for the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 and last|last%3:00:00:: time. What do|do%2:41:01:: you command?" 
 
"Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: who are|be%2:42:05:: within my land|land%1:15:01:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:00:: them all 
except the Lion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch. "Bring that beast|beast%1:03:00:: to me, for 
I have|have%2:40:00:: a mind|mind%1:09:00:: to harness|harness%1:06:00:: him like a horse, and make|make%2:32:00:: him work." 
 
"Your commands|command%1:10:00:: shall be|be%2:42:03:: obeyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the leader; and then, with a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and noise, the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to 
the place|place%1:15:00:: where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: walking. 
 
 
 
Some of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: over a country|country%1:15:02:: thickly|thickly%4:02:01:: covered|cover%2:42:01:: with sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
rocks. Here|here%4:02:00:: they dropped|drop%2:38:01:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Woodman, who fell|fall%2:38:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
to the rocks, where he lay|lay%2:35:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: battered|batter%2:35:01:: and dented|dent%2:35:00:: that he could 
neither move|move%1:04:03:: nor groan. 
 
Others of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow, and with their long|long%3:00:01:: 
fingers|finger%1:23:01:: pulled|pull%2:35:00:: all of the straw|straw%1:27:00:: out of his clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and head. They 
made|make%2:30:15:: his hat|hat%1:06:00:: and boots|boot%1:06:00:: and clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: into a small|small%3:00:00:: bundle|bundle%1:06:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:07:: it 
into the top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: of a tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree. 
 
The remaining|remain%2:42:03:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: threw|throw%2:35:00:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of stout|stout%1:13:00:: rope|rope%1:06:00:: around the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and wound|wind%2:35:06:: many|many%3:00:00:: coils|coil%1:25:00:: about his body|body%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: and legs, until he was|be%2:42:03:: 
unable|unable%3:00:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: or scratch|scratch%2:35:00:: or struggle|struggle%2:35:00:: in any way. Then|then%4:02:00:: they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: with him to the Witch's castle, where he was|be%2:42:03:: 
placed|place%2:40:00:: in a small|small%3:00:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: with a high|high%3:00:02:: iron|iron%1:27:00:: fence|fence%1:06:00:: around it, so that he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: escape. 
 
But Dorothy they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: at all. She stood, with Toto in her 
arms, watching|watch%2:39:02:: the sad|sad%3:00:00:: fate|fate%1:11:00:: of her comrades|comrade%1:18:00:: and thinking|think%2:31:03:: it would 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:06:: her turn. The leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her, 
his long, hairy|hairy%3:00:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and his ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: grinning|grin%2:29:00:: 
terribly; but he saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the Good|good%1:07:00:: Witch's kiss|kiss%1:04:00:: upon her 
forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: and stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, motioning|motion%2:32:00:: the others not|not%4:02:00:: to touch|touch%2:35:00:: her. 
 
 
 
"We dare not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: this little|little%3:00:01:: girl," he said|say%2:32:00:: to them, "for she is|be%2:42:06:: 
protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the Power|power%1:07:00:: of Good, and that is|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:large:00 than the Power|power%1:07:00:: 
of Evil. All we can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: her to the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch|witch%1:18:03:: and leave|leave%2:31:05:: her there." 
 
So, carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and gently, they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: her swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the castle, 
where they set|set%2:35:00:: her down|down%4:02:00:: upon the front|front%3:00:00:: door|door%1:06:01:: step. Then|then%4:02:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: obeyed|obey%2:41:00:: you as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as we were|be%2:42:03:: able. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: destroyed, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in your yard. The 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: we dare|dare%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm, nor the dog|dog%1:05:00:: she carries|carry%2:35:02:: in her arms. Your 
power|power%1:07:00:: over our band|band%1:14:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: ended, and you will never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: us again." 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: all the Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys, with much|much%3:00:00:: laughing and chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and 
noise, flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: both surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: and worried|worry%2:37:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: 
on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: well|well%4:02:00:: that neither the Winged 
Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: nor she, herself, dare hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: in any way. She looked|look%2:39:00:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: at Dorothy's feet, and seeing|see%2:39:00:: the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes, began|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble|tremble%2:38:00:: 
with fear, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: what a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm|charm%1:06:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to them. At 
first|first%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: tempted|tempt%2:32:01:: to run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Dorothy; but she happened|happen%2:30:02:: 
to look|look%2:39:00:: into the child's eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: how simple|simple%3:00:02:: the soul|soul%1:18:00:: behind them 
was, and that the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: gave|give%2:40:03:: her. So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: to herself, and 
thought, "I can still|still%4:02:01:: make|make%2:30:00:: her my slave, for she does|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: how to 
use|use%2:34:01:: her power." Then|then%4:02:00:: she said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, harshly|harshly%4:02:02:: and severely, 
 
"Come with me; and see|see%2:31:03:: that you mind|mind%2:31:02:: everything I tell|tell%2:32:04:: you, for if 
you do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: I will make|make%2:30:00:: an end|end%1:28:00:: of you, as I did|do%2:41:01:: of the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and 
the Scarecrow." 
 
Dorothy followed|follow%2:38:00:: her through many|many%3:00:00:: of the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: in her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the kitchen, where the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: bade|bid%2:32:00:: her clean|clean%2:35:00:: the pots|pot%1:06:00:: 
and kettles|kettle%1:06:00:: and sweep|sweep%1:18:00:: the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the fire|fire%1:22:00:: fed|fed%1:18:00:: with wood. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:41:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: meekly, with her mind|mind%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as 
she could; for she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
her. 
 
With Dorothy hard|hard%4:02:00:: at work|work%1:04:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:41:00:: into the 
court-yard and harness|harness%1:06:00:: the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: like a horse; it would amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: 
her, she was|be%2:42:03:: sure, to make|make%2:32:00:: him draw|draw%2:35:03:: her chariot|chariot%1:06:00:: whenever she wished|wish%2:37:02:: 
to go|go%2:38:00:: to drive. But as she opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar|roar%1:11:01:: 
and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: at her so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and shut|shut%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: again. 
 
"If I cannot harness|harness%1:06:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: to the Lion, speaking|speaking%1:10:01:: 
through the bars|bar%1:06:00:: of the gate, "I can starve|starve%2:34:03:: you. You shall have|have%2:40:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: until you do|do%2:41:01:: as I wish." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: after that she took|take%2:38:10:: no food|food%1:03:00:: to the imprisoned|imprison%2:41:00:: Lion; but every day|day%1:28:00:: 
she came|come%2:38:04:: to the gate|gate%1:06:00:: at noon|noon%1:28:00:: and asked, 
 
"Are you ready|ready%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: like a horse?" 
 
And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would answer, 
 
"No. If you come|come%2:38:00:: in this yard|yard%1:06:02:: I will bite|bite%2:35:00:: you." 
 
The reason|reason%1:10:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: wished|wish%2:37:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
every night, while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: him food|food%1:03:00:: from 
the cupboard. After he had|have%2:34:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: he would lie|lie%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his bed|bed%1:06:00:: of straw, 
and Dorothy would lie|lie%2:35:00:: beside him and put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: on his soft, shaggy 
mane, while they talked|talk%2:32:01:: of their troubles|trouble%1:09:00:: and tried|try%2:41:00:: to plan|plan%2:31:00:: some way|way%1:04:01:: to 
escape. But they could find|find%2:36:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the castle, for it was|be%2:42:06:: 
constantly|constantly%4:02:01:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: by the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, who were|be%2:42:03:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and too|too%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her not|not%4:02:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as she told|tell%2:32:02:: them. 
 
The girl|girl%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during the day, and often|often%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
threatened|threaten%2:32:00:: to beat|beat%2:35:01:: her with the same|same%3:00:02:: old|old%3:00:01:: umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: she always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: in 
her hand. But, in truth, she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: to strike|strike%2:35:00:: Dorothy, because of 
the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon her forehead. The child|child%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, and was|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: 
of fear|fear%1:12:00:: for herself and Toto. Once|once%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: struck|strike%2:35:00:: Toto a blow|blow%1:04:01:: with 
her umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: and the brave|brave%2:42:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at her and bit|bite%2:35:00:: her leg, in 
return. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: bleed|bleed%2:29:00:: where she was|be%2:42:03:: bitten, for she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: that the blood|blood%1:08:00:: in her had|have%2:40:00:: dried|dry%2:30:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: before. 
 
Dorothy's life|life%1:26:02:: became|become%2:30:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: as she grew|grow%2:30:03:: to understand|understand%2:31:01:: that it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again. 
Sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: she would cry|cry%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: for hours, with Toto sitting|sit%2:42:00:: at her 
feet|foot%1:08:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: into her face, whining|whine%2:32:00:: dismally|dismally%4:02:01:: to show|show%2:39:00:: how sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: he 
was|be%2:42:06:: for his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether he was|be%2:42:03:: 
in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: or the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: with him; but he 
knew|know%2:31:01:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: unhappy, and that made|make%2:30:00:: him unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: too. 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 longing|longing%1:12:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: for her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: which the girl|girl%1:18:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: wore. Her Bees|bee%1:05:00:: and her Crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
her Wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in heaps|heap%1:14:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:00:: up, and she had|have%2:40:01:: used|use%2:34:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
all the power|power%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap; but if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:40:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: they would give|give%2:40:03:: her more|more%3:00:01:: power|power%1:07:00:: than all the other|other%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:09:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost. She watched|watch%2:41:00:: Dorothy carefully, to see|see%2:32:00:: if she 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: her shoes, thinking|think%2:31:03:: she might steal|steal%2:40:00:: them. But the child|child%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that she never|never%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: except 
at night|night%1:28:00:: and when she took|take%2:39:00:: her bath. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
of the dark|dark%1:26:00:: to dare|dare%2:41:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: in Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: at night|night%1:28:00:: to take|take%2:40:01:: the shoes, 
and her dread|dread%1:12:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 than her fear|fear%1:12:00:: of the dark, so she 
never|never%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: bathing. Indeed, the old|old%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: never|never%4:02:01:: 
touched|touch%2:39:00:: water, nor ever|ever%4:02:04:: let|let%2:41:00:: water|water%1:27:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: her in any way. 
 
But the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature|creature%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: cunning, and she finally|finally%4:02:02:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of 
a trick|trick%1:04:04:: that would give|give%2:40:03:: her what she wanted. She placed|place%2:35:00:: a bar|bar%1:06:00:: of iron|iron%1:27:00:: 
in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor, and then|then%4:02:00:: by her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:12:: 
the iron|iron%1:27:00:: invisible|invisible%3:00:04:: to human|human%3:01:01:: eyes. So that when Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: across 
the floor|floor%1:06:00:: she stumbled|stumble%2:38:00:: over the bar, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: it, and 
fell|fall%2:38:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length. She was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: hurt, but in her fall|fall%1:04:01:: one of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: off, and before she could reach|reach%2:42:00:: it the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
had|have%2:42:00:: snatched|snatch%2:35:00:: it away|away%4:02:01:: and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 skinny|skinny%3:00:00:thin:03 foot. 
 
The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with the success|success%1:26:00:: of her trick, 
for as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: one of the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: she owned|own%2:40:00:: half the power|power%1:07:00:: of 
their charm, and Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: use|use%2:34:01:: it against her, even|even%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: she 
known|know%2:31:01:: how to do|do%2:41:01:: so. 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, seeing|see%2:31:01:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: one of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes, grew|grow%2:30:00:: 
angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"Give me back|back%2:38:01:: my shoe!" 
 
"I will not," retorted|retort%2:32:00:: the Witch, "for it is|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: my shoe, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
yours." 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: to 
take|take%2:40:00:: my shoe|shoe%1:06:00:: from me." 
 
"I shall keep|keep%2:40:00:: it, just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, laughing at her, 
"and some day|day%1:28:00:: I shall get|get%2:40:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one from you, too." 
 
This made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy so|so%4:02:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: that she picked|pick%2:40:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of 
water|water%1:27:00:: that stood|stand%2:35:00:: near and dashed|dash%2:35:02:: it over the Witch, wetting|wet%2:30:00:: her from 
head|head%1:08:00:: to foot. 
 
Instantly|instantly%4:02:02:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fear; and then, as 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at her in wonder, the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to shrink|shrink%2:30:01:: and fall|fall%2:38:00:: 
away. 
 
"See what you have|have%2:40:00:: done!" she screamed. "In a minute|minute%1:28:00:: I shall melt|melt%2:30:01:: 
away." 
 
"I'm very|very%4:02:00:: sorry, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 to 
see|see%2:39:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: actually|actually%4:02:00:: melting|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: like brown|brown%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sugar|sugar%1:13:00:: before her very|very%4:02:00:: 
eyes. 
 
"Didn't you know|know%2:31:01:: water|water%1:27:00:: would be|be%2:42:03:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Witch, in a 
wailing, despairing voice. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: not," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "how should I?" 
 
"Well, in a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all melted, and you will have|have%2:40:00:: the 
castle|castle%1:06:02:: to yourself. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: in my day, but I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: 
a little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: like you would ever|ever%4:02:04:: be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to melt|melt%2:30:01:: me and end|end%2:30:01:: my 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: deeds. Look|look%1:04:00:: out--here I go!" 
 
With these words|word%1:10:03:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in a brown, melted, shapeless|shapeless%3:00:00:unformed:00 
mass|mass%1:17:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to spread|spread%2:38:02:: over the clean|clean%3:00:01:: boards|board%1:27:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor. 
Seeing|see%2:39:00:: that she had|have%2:40:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: to nothing, Dorothy drew|draw%2:38:02:: 
another bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:00:: it over the mess. She then|then%4:02:00:: swept|sweep%2:42:00:: 
it all out|out%4:02:04:: the door. After picking|pick%2:31:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoe, which was|be%2:42:03:: 
all that was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: of the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she cleaned|clean%2:35:00:: and dried|dry%2:30:01:: it with a 
cloth, and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her foot|foot%1:08:01:: again. Then, being|be%2:42:03:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 free|free%3:00:00:: to do|do%2:36:01:: 
as she chose, she ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to the court-yard to tell|tell%2:32:04:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: that the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:30:03:: to an end, and that they were|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:02:: prisoners|prisoner%1:18:00:: in a strange|strange%3:00:01:: land. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIII. 
 
 
The Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:31:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: by a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water, and Dorothy at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: 
the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of his prison|prison%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: him free. They went|go%2:38:00:: in together|together%4:02:00:: to 
the castle, where Dorothy's first|first%4:02:00:: act|act%2:36:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: to call|call%2:32:05:: all the Winkies 
together|together%4:02:01:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them that they were|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: longer|long%3:00:02:: slaves. 
 
There was|be%2:42:03:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 rejoicing|rejoice%2:37:00:: among the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, for they had|have%2:40:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:32:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: for the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, who 
had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them with great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 cruelty. They kept|keep%2:41:05:: this day|day%1:28:00:: as 
a holiday, then|then%4:02:01:: and ever|ever%4:02:05:: after, and spent|spend%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: in feasting|feast%2:34:00:: and 
dancing. 
 
"If our friends, the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, were|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: with 
us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"Don't you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we could rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"We can try," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they called|call%2:32:01:: the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies and asked|ask%2:32:00:: them if they would help|help%2:41:00:: 
to rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: their friends, and the Winkies said|say%2:32:00:: that they would be|be%2:42:03:: 
delighted|delighted%3:00:00:pleased:00 to do|do%2:41:01:: all in their power|power%1:07:02:: for Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: 
from bondage. So she chose|choose%2:31:00:: a number|number%1:07:00:: of the Winkies who looked|look%2:39:01:: as if 
they knew|know%2:31:00:: the most, and they all started|start%2:38:02:: away. They travelled|travel%2:38:00:: that 
day|day%1:28:00:: and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the rocky|rocky%3:00:00:rough:00 plain|plain%1:17:00:: where the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman lay, all battered|batter%2:35:01:: and bent. His axe|axe%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: near him, but the 
blade|blade%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: and the handle|handle%2:35:01:: broken|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: short. 
 
The Winkies lifted|lift%2:38:00:: him tenderly|tenderly%4:02:00:: in their arms, and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him back|back%4:02:04:: 
to the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 castle|castle%1:06:02:: again, Dorothy shedding|shed%2:35:02:: a few|few%3:00:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: by the way|way%1:15:00:: 
at the sad|sad%3:00:00:: plight|plight%1:26:00:: of her old|old%3:00:02:: friend, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: looking|look%2:39:01:: sober|sober%3:00:01:: and 
sorry. When they reached|reach%2:38:01:: the castle|castle%1:06:00:: Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: to the Winkies, 
 
"Are any of your people|people%1:14:02:: tinsmiths?" 
 
"Oh, yes; some of us are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: tinsmiths," they told|tell%2:32:04:: her. 
 
"Then bring|bring%2:35:00:: them to me," she said. And when the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: came, 
bringing|bring%2:38:00:: with them all their tools|tool%1:06:00:: in baskets, she enquired, 
 
[Illustration: "_The Tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four 
nights._"] 
 
"Can you straighten|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: those dents|dent%1:25:00:: in the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, and bend|bend%1:25:01:: 
him back|back%4:02:05:: into shape|shape%1:08:00:: again, and solder|solder%1:27:00:: him together|together%4:02:02:: where he is|be%2:42:05:: 
broken?" 
 
The tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: over carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:00:: answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
that they thought|think%2:31:03:: they could mend|mend%2:30:00:: him so he would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:00:: in one of the big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: of the castle|castle%1:06:00:: and 
worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four nights, hammering|hammer%2:35:00:: and twisting|twist%2:35:02:: and 
bending|bend%2:35:08:: and soldering and polishing|polish%2:35:00:: and pounding|pound%2:35:00:: at the legs|leg%1:08:01:: and body|body%1:08:00:: 
and head|head%1:08:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, until at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: straightened|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into 
his old|old%3:00:01:: form, and his joints|joint%1:08:00:: worked|work%2:35:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, there 
were|be%2:42:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 patches|patch%1:07:00:: on him, but the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: a good|good%3:00:01:: job, and as 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a vain|vain%3:00:00:proud:00 man|man%1:18:00:: he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: the patches|patch%1:06:00:: at all. 
 
When, at last, he walked|walk%2:38:00:: into Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her for 
rescuing|rescue%2:41:00:: him, he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: that he wept|weep%2:29:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: of joy, and 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: every tear|tear%2:29:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: from his face|face%1:08:00:: with her 
apron, so his joints|joint%1:08:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: rusted. At the same|same%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
tears|tear%1:08:01:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 and fast|fast%3:00:01:: at the joy|joy%1:12:00:: of meeting|meet%2:41:01:: her old|old%3:00:03:past:00 friend|friend%1:18:00:: again, 
and these tears|tear%1:08:01:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: need|need%2:34:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: away. As for the Lion, he 
wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: with the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of his tail|tail%1:05:00:: that it became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: 
wet, and he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into the court-yard and hold|hold%2:35:00:: it in 
the sun|sun%1:19:00:: till it dried. 
 
"If we only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: with us again," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
when Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: telling|tell%2:32:01:: him everything that had|have%2:40:00:: happened, 
"I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"We must try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: she called|call%2:32:05:: the Winkies to help|help%2:41:00:: her, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: all that day|day%1:28:00:: 
and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
of which the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: tossed|toss%2:35:04:: the Scarecrow's clothes. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree, and the trunk|trunk%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: that no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could climb|climb%2:38:00:: it; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: at once, 
 
"I'll chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, and then|then%4:02:00:: we can get|get%2:35:03:: the Scarecrow's clothes." 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: while the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: at work|work%1:04:00:: mending|mend%2:30:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: himself, 
another of the Winkies, who was|be%2:41:00:: a goldsmith, had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:01:: an axe-handle 
of solid|solid%3:00:00:homogeneous:00 gold|gold%1:27:00:: and fitted|fit%2:40:00:: it to the Woodman's axe, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the 
old|old%3:00:01:: broken|broken%3:00:01:: handle. Others polished|polish%2:35:00:: the blade|blade%1:06:00:: until all the rust|rust%1:22:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
removed|remove%2:30:00:: and it glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: like burnished|burnish%2:35:00:: silver. 
 
As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: spoken, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop, and in a 
short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:15:: over|over%4:02:01:: with a crash, when the Scarecrow's 
clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: out of the branches|branch%1:20:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: on the ground. 
 
Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: them up|up%4:02:00:: and had|have%2:32:00:: the Winkies carry|carry%2:35:02:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to the 
castle, where they were|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: with nice, clean|clean%3:00:01:: straw; and, behold! 
here|here%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever, thanking|thank%2:32:00:: them over and over 
again|again%4:02:00:: for saving|save%2:41:01:: him. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: reunited, Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: spent|spend%2:42:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
at the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Castle, where they found|find%2:40:02:: everything they needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
them comfortable. But one day|day%1:28:03:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: of Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, and said, 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Oz, and claim|claim%2:40:00:: his promise." 
 
"Yes," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, "at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my heart." 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, joyfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clapping|clap%2:29:00:: her hands. 
"Oh, let|let%2:41:00:: us start|start%2:30:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to-morrow!" 
 
 
 
This they decided|decide%2:31:00:: to do. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 day|day%1:28:00:: they called|call%2:41:00:: the Winkies together|together%4:02:01:: 
and bade|bid%2:32:01:: them good-bye. The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to have|have%2:30:00:: them go, and 
they had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: that they begged|beg%2:32:00:: him to stay|stay%2:42:01:: 
and rule|rule%1:26:00:: over them and the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Land|land%1:15:01:: of the West. Finding|finding%1:04:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: 
determined|determine%2:31:00:: to go, the Winkies gave|give%2:40:00:: Toto and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: each a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 
collar; and to Dorothy they presented|present%2:40:01:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: bracelet, studded|stud%2:42:00:: 
with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they gave|give%2:40:00:: a gold-headed walking|walking%1:04:00:: 
stick, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: him from stumbling; and to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: they offered|offer%2:40:02:: 
a silver|silver%1:27:00:: oil-can, inlaid with gold|gold%1:27:00:: and set|set%2:35:02:: with precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 jewels. 
 
Every one of the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: the Winkies a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 speech|speech%1:10:01:: in 
return, and all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with them until their arms|arm%1:08:00:: ached. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to the Witch's cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: with food|food%1:03:00:: for 
the journey, and there she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Golden Cap. She tried|try%2:41:01:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
head|head%1:08:00:: and found|find%2:31:09:: that it fitted|fit%2:30:01:: her exactly. She did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: anything 
about the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap, but she saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: pretty, so|so%4:02:09:: 
she made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: to wear|wear%2:29:00:: it and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: in the basket. 
 
Then, being|be%2:42:03:: prepared|prepare%2:30:00:: for the journey, they all started|start%2:38:02:: for the 
Emerald City; and the Winkies gave|give%2:40:07:: them three cheers|cheer%1:10:00:: and many|many%3:00:00:: good|good%3:00:00:fortunate:00 
wishes|wish%1:09:00:: to carry|carry%2:42:01:: with them. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIV. 
 
 
You will remember|remember%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: no road--not even|even%4:02:00:: a pathway--between 
the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. When the four 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in search|search%1:04:00:: of the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: sent|send%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to bring|bring%2:38:00:: them to her. It was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: harder|hard%3:00:06:: 
to find|find%2:36:00:: their way|way%1:15:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: through the big|big%3:00:01:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of buttercups|buttercup%1:20:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: than it was|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: carried. They knew, of course, they 
must go|go%2:38:00:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: east, toward the rising|rise%2:38:08:: sun; and they started|start%2:38:02:: off|off%4:02:03:: 
in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 way. But at noon, when the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: over their heads, 
they did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: which was|be%2:42:03:: east|east%3:00:00:: and which was|be%2:42:03:: west, and that was|be%2:42:06:: 
the reason|reason%1:16:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: lost|lose%2:39:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 fields. They kept|keep%2:42:07:: on walking, 
however, and at night|night%1:28:00:: the moon|moon%1:17:01:: came|come%2:30:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and shone brightly. So they 
lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: among the sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 smelling|smell%2:39:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: 
until morning--all but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: behind a cloud, but they started|start%2:30:00:: on, as 
if they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: which way|way%1:15:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: going. 
 
"If we walk|walk%2:38:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: enough," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "we shall sometime|sometime%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to 
some place, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure." 
 
But day|day%1:28:00:: by day|day%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:38:03:: away, and they still|still%4:02:01:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: before them 
but the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to grumble|grumble%2:32:02:: a bit. 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," he said, "and unless we find|find%2:40:02:: it again|again%4:02:00:: 
in time|time%1:28:05:: to reach|reach%2:38:01:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: I shall never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:40:00:: my brains." 
 
"Nor I my heart," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me I can 
scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: wait|wait%2:31:00:: till I get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz, and you must admit|admit%2:32:00:: this is|be%2:42:06:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
long|long%3:00:02:: journey." 
 
"You see," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the 
courage|courage%1:07:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:07:: tramping|tramp%2:38:00:: forever, without getting|get%2:38:00:: anywhere|anywhere%4:02:00:: at all." 
 
 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy lost|lose%2:40:02:: heart. She sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her 
companions, and they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her, and Toto found|find%2:39:02:: that 
for the first|first%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: in his life|life%1:28:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: to chase|chase%2:38:00:: a butterfly|butterfly%1:05:00:: 
that flew|fly%2:38:00:: past his head; so he put|put%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his tongue|tongue%1:08:00:: and panted|pant%2:32:00:: and 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy as if to ask|ask%2:32:00:: what they should do|do%2:41:01:: next. 
 
"Suppose we call|call%2:32:01:: the Field|field%1:15:01:: Mice," she suggested. "They could probably|probably%4:02:00:: 
tell|tell%2:32:00:: us the way|way%1:04:01:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they could," cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow; "why didn't we think|think%2:31:00:: of 
that before?" 
 
Dorothy blew|blow%2:29:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: she had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: about her neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
since the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: it to her. In a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
they heard|hear%2:39:00:: the pattering of tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 feet, and many|many%3:00:00:: of the small|small%3:00:00:: grey|grey%3:00:00:achromatic:00 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her. Among them was|be%2:42:06:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: herself, who 
asked, in her squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for my friends?" 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. "Can you tell|tell%2:32:00:: us where the 
Emerald|emerald%1:21:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is?" 
 
 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Queen; "but it is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 way|way%1:04:02:: off, for you 
have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: it at your backs|back%1:08:00:: all this time." Then|then%4:02:00:: she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: Dorothy's 
Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Cap, and 
call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to you? They will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Oz 
in less|less%3:00:00:: than an hour." 
 
"I didn't know|know%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: a charm," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in surprise. 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: written|write%2:36:02:: inside the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice; 
"but if you are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: we must run|run%2:38:00:: away, 
for they are|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: and think|think%2:31:01:: it great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fun|fun%1:04:00:: to plague|plague%2:37:00:: us." 
 
"Won't they hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"Oh, no; they must obey|obey%2:41:00:: the wearer|wearer%1:18:00:: of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: out of sight, with all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: hurrying|hurry%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: inside the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: some words|word%1:10:00:: written|write%2:36:01:: upon 
the lining. These, she thought, must be|be%2:42:06:: the charm, so she read|read%2:31:00:: the 
directions|direction%1:04:01:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and put|put%2:35:00:: the Cap|cap%1:06:00:: upon her head. 
 
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing|stand%2:35:00:: on her left|left%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"What did|do%2:41:01:: you say?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what she 
was|be%2:42:03:: doing. 
 
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: on, standing|standing%1:26:00:: this time|time%1:11:00:: on her 
right|right%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"Hello!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, calmly. 
 
[Illustration: "_The Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00::

"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: on both 
feet. This ended|end%2:42:01:: the saying|saying%1:10:00:: of the charm, and they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
chattering|chatter%2:32:02:: and flapping|flap%2:38:03:: of wings, as the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to them. The King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy, and asked, 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: your command?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: the child, "and we have|have%2:40:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way." 
 
"We will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the King, and no sooner|sooner%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: he spoken|speak%2:32:00:: 
than two of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
with her. Others took|take%2:38:09:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and 
one little|little%3:00:00:young:00 Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: Toto and flew|fly%2:38:00:: after them, although the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
tried|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at first, 
for they remembered|remember%2:31:00:: how badly|badly%4:02:02:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:39:06:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them 
before; but they saw|saw%2:35:00:: that no harm|harm%1:26:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: intended, so they rode|ride%2:38:01:: through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: cheerfully, and had|have%2:39:06:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 time|time%1:11:01:: looking|look%2:39:00:: at the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
gardens|garden%1:06:00:: and woods|wood%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:02:: below them. 
 
Dorothy found|find%2:39:01:: herself riding|rid%2:40:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: between two of the biggest|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
Monkeys, one of them the King|king%1:18:00:: himself. They had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: of their 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: her. 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you have|have%2:40:00:: to obey|obey%2:41:00:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Golden Cap?" she asked. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: a long|long%3:00:02:: story," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the King, with a laugh; "but as we 
have|have%2:40:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: before us I will pass|pass%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: by telling|tell%2:32:00:: you 
about it, if you wish." 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: it," she replied. 
 
"Once," began|begin%2:30:00:: the leader, "we were|be%2:42:03:: a free|free%3:00:00:: people, living|live%2:42:06:: happily|happily%4:02:01:: in 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, flying|fly%2:38:00:: from tree|tree%1:20:00:: to tree, eating nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and fruit, 
and doing|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we pleased|please%2:37:01:: without calling|call%2:32:02:: anybody master. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: 
some of us were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: too|too%4:02:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: at times, flying|fly%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to 
pull|pull%2:35:00:: the tails|tail%1:05:00:: of the animals|animal%1:03:00:: that had|have%2:40:04:: no wings, chasing|chase%2:38:00:: birds, and 
throwing|throw%2:36:02:: nuts|nut%1:20:00:: at the people|people%1:14:00:: who walked|walk%2:38:00:: in the forest. But we were|be%2:42:03:: 
careless|careless%3:00:00:artless:00 and happy|happy%3:00:00:: and full|full%3:00:00:: of fun, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: every minute|minute%1:28:00:: of the 
day. This was|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, long|long%4:02:00:: before Oz came|come%2:38:04:: out of the clouds|cloud%1:17:00:: 
to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over this land. 
 
"There lived|live%2:42:08:: here|here%4:02:00:: then, away|away%4:02:00:: at the North, a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: princess, who 
was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: sorceress. All her magic|magic%1:09:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: the 
people, and she was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:02:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: anyone who was|be%2:42:03:: good. Her name|name%1:26:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: Gayelette, and she lived|live%2:42:08:: in a handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 palace|palace%1:06:01:: built|build%2:36:00:: from great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
blocks|block%1:25:01:: of ruby. Everyone loved|love%2:37:00:: her, but her greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
she could find|find%2:40:01:: no one|one%1:23:00:: to love|love%2:37:01:: in return, since all the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
too|too%4:02:00:: stupid|stupid%3:00:00:: and ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: to mate|mate%2:35:00:: with one so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and wise. At last, 
however, she found|find%2:40:02:: a boy|boy%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 and manly|manly%3:00:00:: and wise|wise%3:00:00:: beyond 
his years. Gayelette made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: that when he grew|grow%2:30:04:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
she would make|make%2:30:00:: him her husband, so she took|take%2:38:09:: him to her ruby|ruby%1:27:00:: palace|palace%1:14:00:: 
and used|use%2:34:01:: all her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: him as strong|strong%3:00:00:: and good|good%3:00:01:: and 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 as any woman|woman%1:18:00:: could wish. When he grew|grow%2:30:03:: to manhood, Quelala, 
as he was|be%2:42:03:: called, was|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: the best|best%3:00:00:: and wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the 
land, while his manly|manly%3:00:00:: beauty|beauty%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 that Gayelette loved|love%2:37:00:: him 
dearly, and hastened|hasten%2:30:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: everything ready|ready%3:00:00:: for the wedding. 
 
"My grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: at that time|time%1:28:00:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: which 
lived|live%2:42:08:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: near Gayalette's palace, and the old|old%3:00:02:: fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: 
a joke|joke%1:10:00:: better|better%4:02:00:: than a good|good%3:00:01:: dinner. One day, just|just%4:02:01:: before the wedding, 
my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: with his band|band%1:14:00:: when he saw|saw%2:35:00:: Quelala 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: beside the river. He was|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a rich|rich%3:00:00:colorful:00 costume|costume%1:06:01:: of pink|pink%1:07:00:: 
silk|silk%1:06:00:: and purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 velvet, and my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: he would see|see%2:39:00:: what 
he could do. At his word|word%1:10:06:: the band|band%1:14:01:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and seized|seize%2:35:01:: Quelala, 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: him in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: until they were|be%2:42:05:: over the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the 
river, and then|then%4:02:00:: dropped|drop%2:38:01:: him into the water. 
 
"'Swim out, my fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fellow,'" cried|cry%2:32:01:: my grandfather, "'and see|see%2:32:00:: if the 
water|water%1:13:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: spotted|spot%2:35:00:: your clothes.'" Quelala was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
swim, and he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: in the least|least%3:00:00:: spoiled|spoil%2:41:01:: by all his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. He 
laughed, when he came|come%2:38:04:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the water, and swam in to shore. 
But when Gayelette came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to him she found|find%2:40:00:: his silks|silk%1:06:00:: and

"The princess|princess%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry, and she knew, of course, who did|do%2:41:01:: it. She 
had|have%2:30:00:: all the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: before her, and she said|say%2:32:00:: at first|first%3:00:00:: 
that their wings|wing%1:05:00:: should be|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: and they should be|be%2:42:03:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: as they had|have%2:40:00:: 
treated|treat%2:29:00:: Quelala, and dropped|drop%2:38:01:: in the river. But my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: pleaded|plead%2:32:03:: 
hard, for he knew|know%2:31:02:: the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: would drown|drown%2:30:00:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: with their wings|wing%1:05:00:: 
tied, and Quelala said|say%2:32:00:: a kind|kind%1:09:00:: word|word%1:10:03:: for them also; so|so%4:02:05:: that Gayelette 
finally|finally%4:02:00:: spared|spar%2:32:00:: them, on condition|condition%1:10:01:: that the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: should ever|ever%4:02:00:: 
after do|do%2:41:01:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the bidding|bidding%1:10:02:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap. This 
Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for a wedding|wedding%1:11:00:: present|present%3:00:02:: to Quelala, and it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to 
have|have%2:42:00:: cost|cost%2:42:01:: the princess|princess%1:18:00:: half her kingdom. Of course|course%1:14:00:: my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: and 
all the other|other%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to the condition, and that is|be%2:42:06:: 
how it happens|happen%2:30:00:: that we are|be%2:42:03:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the 
Golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Cap, whomsoever he may be." 
 
"And what became|become%2:42:01:: of them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:39:06:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: 
interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the story. 
 
"Quelala being|be%2:42:06:: the first|first%3:00:00:: owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Monkey, "he was|be%2:42:03:: the first|first%3:00:00:: to lay|lay%2:35:01:: his wishes|wish%1:12:00:: upon us. As his bride|bride%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: the sight|sight%1:09:00:: of us, he called|call%2:32:05:: us all to him in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: 
after he had|have%2:40:00:: married|marry%2:41:00:: her and ordered|order%2:32:01:: us to always|always%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:40:00:: where she 
could never|never%4:02:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on a Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkey, which we were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to 
do, for we were|be%2:42:03:: all afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her. 
 
"This was|be%2:42:06:: all we ever|ever%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: until the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: into the 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the West, who made|make%2:32:00:: us enslave|enslave%2:41:00:: the 
Winkies, and afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: drive|drive%2:35:00:: Oz himself out of the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: yours, and three times|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: the right|right%1:07:00:: to 
lay|lay%2:35:01:: your wishes|wish%1:09:00:: upon us." 
 
As the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: his story|story%1:10:03:: Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the 
green, shining|shin%2:38:00:: walls|wall%1:17:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: before them. She wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
at the rapid|rapid%3:00:02:fast:01 flight|flight%1:04:01:: of the Monkeys, but was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
over. The strange|strange%3:00:00:: creatures|creature%1:03:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: before 
the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the City, the King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: away, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
"That was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: ride," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. 
 
"Yes, and a quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 way|way%1:04:01:: out of our troubles." replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "How 
lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 it was|be%2:42:06:: you brought|bring%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: that wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Cap!" 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XV. 
 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: 
and rang|ring%2:39:01:: the bell. After ringing|ring%2:39:01:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 times|time%1:11:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: opened|open%2:35:00:: by the 
same|same%3:00:02:: Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gate|gate%1:06:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: before. 
 
"What! are|be%2:42:06:: you back|back%4:02:04:: again?" he asked, in surprise. 
 
"Do you not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: us?" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:03:: you had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: to visit|visit%2:41:02:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West." 
 
"We did|do%2:41:01:: visit|visit%1:14:00:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And she let|let%2:41:00:: you go|go%2:38:01:: again?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in wonder. 
 
"She could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it, for she is|be%2:42:03:: melted," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Melted! Well, that is|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: news, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the man. "Who melted|melt%2:30:00:: 
her?" 
 
"It was|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, gravely. 
 
"Good gracious!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man, and he bowed|bow%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: 
before her. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he led|lead%2:38:01:: them into his little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: and locked|lock%2:35:00:: the spectacles|spectacle%1:10:00:: 
from the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 box|box%1:06:02:: on all their eyes, just|just%4:02:05:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:36:01:: before. 
Afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: through the gate|gate%1:06:00:: into the Emerald City, and 
when the people|people%1:14:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: from the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gate|gate%1:06:00:: that they had|have%2:40:00:: 
melted|melt%2:30:02:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: they all gathered|gather%2:41:00:: around the 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: and followed|follow%2:38:00:: them in a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: on guard|guard%1:07:00:: before the 
door, but he let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: at once|once%4:02:02:: and they were|be%2:42:03:: again|again%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: by the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who showed|show%2:38:00:: each of them to their old|old%3:00:01:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: at 
once, so they might rest|rest%2:32:00:: until the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to receive|receive%2:35:00:: them. 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: the news|news%1:10:01:: carried|carry%2:36:00:: straight|straight%3:00:00:continuous:01 to Oz that Dorothy and the 
other|other%3:00:00:: travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: again, after destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch; but Oz made|make%2:36:12:: no reply. They thought|think%2:31:03:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: would send|send%2:35:00:: 
for them at once, but he did|do%2:41:01:: not. They had|have%2:40:00:: no word|word%1:10:02:: from him the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting|waiting%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: tiresome|tiresome%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 and wearing, 
and at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they grew|grow%2:30:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: that Oz should treat|treat%2:41:00:: them in so|so%4:02:02:: poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 a 
fashion, after sending|send%2:38:01:: them to undergo|undergo%2:39:04:: hardships|hardship%1:26:01:: and slavery. So the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 asked|ask%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: to take|take%2:38:10:: another message|message%1:10:01:: to Oz, 
saying|say%2:32:00:: if he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him at once|once%4:02:02:: they would call|call%2:32:01:: the 
Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: them, and find|find%2:32:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: whether he kept|keep%2:41:03:: his promises|promise%1:10:00:: 
or not. When the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:07:: this message|message%1:10:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 
that he sent|send%2:38:01:: word|word%1:10:02:: for them to come|come%2:38:04:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: at four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
after nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. He had|have%2:40:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
in the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West, and he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:02:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them again. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: a sleepless|sleepless%3:00:00:awake:00 night, each thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: of the 
gift|gift%1:21:00:: Oz had|have%2:39:06:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: to bestow|bestow%2:40:02:: upon him. Dorothy fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: 
once, and then|then%4:02:00:: she dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: she was|be%2:42:05:: in Kansas, where Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:05:: 
telling|tell%2:32:04:: her how glad|glad%3:00:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: to have|have%2:39:06:: her little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:04:: at home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
Promptly|promptly%4:02:00:: at nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskered|whiskered%3:00:00:unshaven:00 soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: 
came|come%2:38:00:: to them, and four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: later|later%4:02:01:: they all went|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room|room%1:06:00:: of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Of course|course%1:14:00:: each one of them expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: in the shape|shape%1:08:00:: 
he had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:31:03:: before, and all were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: when they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
about and saw|saw%2:35:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: at all in the room. They kept|keep%2:42:03:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: 
and closer|close%3:00:01:: to one another, for the stillness|stillness%1:07:00:: of the empty|empty%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 than any of the forms|form%1:03:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz take. 
 
 
 
Presently|presently%4:02:01:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a Voice, seeming|seem%2:39:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: from somewhere|somewhere%4:02:00:: near 
the top|top%1:15:01:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 dome, and it said, solemnly. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
They looked|look%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: in every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room, and then, seeing|see%2:39:00:: no one, 
Dorothy asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:05:: everywhere," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Voice, "but to the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of common|common%3:00:02:: 
mortals|mortal%1:03:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: invisible. I|i%1:27:00:: will now|now%4:02:05:: seat|seat%1:06:00:: myself upon my throne, that 
you may converse|converse%2:32:00:: with me." Indeed, the Voice|voice%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: to come|come%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%4:02:04:: from the throne|throne%1:06:00:: itself; so they walked|walk%2:38:00:: toward it and stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
in a row|row%1:14:00:: while Dorothy said: 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to claim|claim%2:40:00:: our promise, O|o%1:10:00:: Oz." 
 
"What promise?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"You promised|promise%2:32:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: when the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
destroyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Is the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: destroyed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Voice, and Dorothy 
thought|think%2:31:03:: it trembled|tremble%2:38:00:: a little. 
 
"Yes," she answered, "I melted|melt%2:30:01:: her with a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water." 
 
"Dear me," said|say%2:32:00:: the Voice; "how sudden! Well, come|come%2:38:00:: to me to-morrow, 
for I must have|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it over." 
 
"You've had|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of time|time%1:28:05:: already," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, angrily. 
 
"We shan't wait|wait%2:42:00:: a day|day%1:28:00:: longer," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You must keep|keep%2:41:03:: your promises|promise%1:10:00:: to us!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it might be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: to frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: the Wizard, so|so%4:02:06:: 
he gave|give%2:41:00:: a large, loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar, which was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 and dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 that 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from him in alarm|alarm%1:12:00:: and tipped|tip%2:38:02:: over the screen|screen%1:06:05:: that 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in a corner. As it fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: that way, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: all of them were|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with wonder. For they 
saw, standing|standing%1:26:00:: in just|just%4:02:05:: the spot|spot%1:15:01:: the screen|screen%1:06:05:: had|have%2:40:00:: hidden, a little, old|old%3:00:02:: 
man, with a bald|bald%3:00:00:hairless:00 head|head%1:08:00:: and a wrinkled|wrinkled%3:00:00:: face, who seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: as they were. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, raising|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
toward the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 man|man%1:18:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, in a 
trembling|tremble%2:38:00:: voice, "but don't strike|strike%1:11:00:: me--please don't!--and I'll do|do%2:36:01:: 
anything you want|want%2:37:00:: me to." 
 
Our friends|friend%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: and dismay. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 Beast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:06:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the Lion. 
 
"No; you are|be%2:42:03:: all wrong," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, meekly. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
making|make%2:31:00:: believe." 
 
"Making believe!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "Are you not|not%4:02:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard?" 
 
"Hush, my dear," he said; "don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loud, or you will be|be%2:42:03:: 
overheard--and I should be|be%2:42:03:: ruined. I'm supposed|suppose%2:31:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard." 
 
"And aren't you?" she asked. 
 
"Not a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of it, my dear; I'm just|just%4:02:00:: a common|common%3:00:00:lowborn:00 man." 
 
"You're more|more%3:00:02:: than that," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; 
"you're a humbug." 
 
"Exactly so!" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, rubbing|rub%2:35:00:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: as 
if it pleased|please%2:37:00:: him; "I am|be%2:42:03:: a humbug." 
 
"But this is|be%2:42:03:: terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "how shall I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: 
my heart?" 
 
"Or I my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Or I my brains?" wailed|wail%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: the the tears|tear%1:08:01:: from his 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: with his coat-sleeve. 
 
 
 
"My dear|dear%4:02:00:: friends," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you not|not%4:02:00:: to speak|speak%2:32:01:: of these 
little|little%4:02:00:: things. Think|think%2:31:00:: of me, and the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 trouble|trouble%1:09:00:: I'm in at being|be%2:42:03:: 
found|find%2:32:00:: out." 
 
"Doesn't anyone else know|know%2:31:01:: you're a humbug?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No one knows|know%2:31:01:: it but you four--and myself," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I have|have%2:40:00:: 
fooled|fool%2:32:01:: everyone so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that I thought|think%2:31:03:: I should never|never%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:05:: found|find%2:31:09:: out. 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake|mistake%1:04:00:: my ever|ever%4:02:04:: letting|let%2:41:00:: you into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. 
Usually|usually%4:02:00:: I will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: my subjects, and so they believe|believe%2:31:04:: I am|be%2:42:06:: 
something terrible." 
 
"But, I don't understand," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was|be%2:42:03:: it 
that you appeared|appear%2:30:00:: to me as a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head?" 
 
"That was|be%2:42:06:: one of my tricks," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "Step this way, please, and 
I will tell|tell%2:32:00:: you all about it." 
 
He led|lead%2:38:01:: the way|way%1:23:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: chamber|chamber%1:06:00:: in the rear|rear%1:15:00:: of the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, 
and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him. He pointed|point%2:32:00:: to one corner, in which lay|lay%2:35:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Head, made|make%2:42:05:: out of many|many%3:00:00:: thicknesses|thickness%1:07:01:: of paper, and with a 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: face. 
 
"This I hung|hang%2:35:00:: from the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: by a wire," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "I stood|stand%2:35:00:: behind the 
screen|screen%1:06:04:: and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: a thread, to make|make%2:32:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: move|move%1:04:03:: and the mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: open." 
 
"But how about the voice?" she enquired. 
 
"Oh, I am|be%2:42:06:: a ventriloquist," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "and I can throw|throw%2:38:00:: 
the sound|sound%1:07:00:: of my voice|voice%1:07:00:: wherever I wish; so|so%4:02:06:: that you thought|think%2:31:01:: it was|be%2:42:06:: 
coming|come%2:42:03:: out of the Head. Here|here%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:04:: the other|other%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:06:01:: I used|use%2:34:01:: to deceive|deceive%2:41:00:: 
you." He showed|show%2:39:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: the dress|dress%1:06:00:: and the mask|mask%1:06:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: when 
he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady; and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: that his 
Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of skins, sewn together, with 
slats|slat%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: their sides|side%1:15:00:: out. As for the Ball|ball%1:06:03:: of Fire, the false|false%3:00:00:incorrect:00 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: hung|hang%2:35:00:: that also|also%4:02:00:: from the ceiling. It was|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a ball|ball%1:25:00:: of 
cotton, but when oil|oil%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: poured|pour%2:38:03:: upon it the ball|ball%1:25:00:: burned|burned%3:00:00:treated:00 fiercely. 
 
"Really," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself 
for being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug." 
 
"I am--I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: am," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, sorrowfully; "but it 
was|be%2:42:03:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:04:00:: I could do. Sit|sit%2:38:00:: down, please, there are|be%2:42:04:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of 
chairs; and I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and listened|listen%2:39:01:: while he told|tell%2:32:01:: the following|follow%2:42:05:: tale: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: in Omaha--" 
 
"Why, that isn't very|very%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from Kansas!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but it's farther|far%4:02:04:: from here," he said, shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: at her, 
sadly. "When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I became|become%2:42:01:: a ventriloquist, and at that I was|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: trained|train%2:31:01:: by a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 master. I can imitate|imitate%2:36:00:: any kind|kind%1:09:00:: of a 
bird|bird%1:05:00:: or beast." Here|here%4:02:00:: he mewed|mew%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: like a kitten|kitten%1:05:00:: that Toto pricked|prick%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
his ears|ear%1:08:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: where she was. "After a time," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: Oz, "I tired|tire%2:29:00:: of that, and became|become%2:42:01:: a balloonist." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A man|man%1:18:00:: who goes|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: on circus|circus%1:04:00:: day, so|so%4:02:06:: as to draw|draw%2:35:06:: a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: 
of people|people%1:14:00:: together|together%4:02:03:: and get|get%2:32:00:: them to pay|pay%2:40:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the circus," he explained. 
 
 
 
"Oh," she said; "I know." 
 
"Well, one day|day%1:28:03:: I went|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: and the ropes|rope%1:06:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: twisted, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that I couldn't come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: again. It went|go%2:42:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: above the clouds, so|so%4:02:06:: 
far|far%4:02:02:: that a current|current%1:11:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: struck|strike%2:35:01:: it and carried|carry%2:35:02:: it many, many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
away. For a day|day%1:28:02:: and a night|night%1:28:00:: I travelled|travel%2:38:00:: through the air, and on the 
morning|morning%1:28:01:: of the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day|day%1:28:00:: I awoke|awake%2:29:00:: and found|find%2:39:02:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: floating|float%2:38:00:: over 
a strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country. 
 
"It came|come%2:30:03:: down|down%4:02:00:: gradually, and I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: a bit. But I found|find%2:39:02:: myself 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: people, who, seeing|see%2:39:00:: me come|come%2:38:00:: from the clouds, 
thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard. Of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them think|think%2:31:01:: so, because 
they were|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of me, and promised|promise%2:32:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: anything I wished|wish%2:37:02:: them to. 
 
"Just to amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: myself, and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the good|good%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: busy, I ordered|order%2:32:01:: them to 
build|build%2:36:00:: this City, and my palace; and they did|do%2:41:01:: it all|all%4:02:00:: willingly|willingly%4:02:00:: and well. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: I thought, as the country|country%1:15:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and beautiful, I would 
call|call%2:32:02:: it the Emerald City, and to make|make%2:30:00:: the name|name%1:10:00:: fit|fit%2:42:04:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 I put|put%2:35:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: on all the people, so that everything they saw|saw%2:35:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: green." 
 
"But isn't everything here|here%4:02:00:: green?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No more|more%3:00:02:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: city," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz; "but when you wear|wear%2:29:00:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles, why of course|course%1:17:00:: everything you see|see%2:39:00:: looks|look%1:07:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 to 
you. The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, for I was|be%2:42:03:: a 
young|young%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: when the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: me here, and I am|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: man|man%1:18:04:: 
now. But my people|people%1:14:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: on their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that 
most|most%3:00:02:: of them think|think%2:31:01:: it really|really%4:02:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: an Emerald City, and it certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: place, abounding|abound%2:42:00:: in jewels|jewel%1:06:00:: and precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 metals, and every 
good|good%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:07:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: one happy. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to the 
people, and they like me; but ever|ever%4:02:04:: since this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: 
shut|shut%2:35:00:: myself up|up%4:02:00:: and would not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: any of them. 
 
"One of my greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fears|fear%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the Witches, for while I had|have%2:40:00:: no magical|magical%3:00:00:supernatural:00 
powers|power%1:07:00:: at all I soon|soon%4:02:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:04:: that the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: really|really%4:02:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to 
do|do%2:41:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 things. There were|be%2:42:00:: four of them in this country, and 
they ruled|rule%2:41:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:02:: and South|south%1:15:01:: and East|east%1:15:00:: and 
West. Fortunately, the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: and South|south%1:15:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: good, and 
I knew|know%2:31:01:: they would do|do%2:41:01:: me no harm; but the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and West|west%1:15:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: wicked, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: I was|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: 
than they themselves, they would surely|surely%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:36:00:: me. As it was, 
I lived|live%2:42:01:: in deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fear|fear%1:12:00:: of them for many|many%3:00:00:: years; so you can imagine|imagine%2:36:00:: how 
pleased|please%2:37:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: when I heard|hear%2:31:00:: your house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
of the East. When you came|come%2:38:00:: to me I was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to promise|promise%2:32:00:: anything if 
you would only|only%4:02:02:: do|do%2:36:01:: away|away%4:02:09:: with the other|other%3:00:00:: Witch; but, now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:41:00:: 
melted|melt%2:30:10:: her, I am|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: that I cannot keep|keep%2:41:03:: my promises." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: man," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really|really%4:02:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: man; but I'm a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: 
Wizard, I must admit." 
 
"Can't you give|give%2:40:00:: me brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You don't need them. You are|be%2:42:03:: learning|learn%2:31:00:: something every day. A|a%1:08:00:: baby|baby%1:18:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: brains, but it doesn't know|know%2:31:03:: much. Experience|experience%1:09:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:09:00:: 
that brings|bring%2:38:00:: knowledge, and the longer|long%3:00:02:: you are|be%2:42:05:: on earth|earth%1:15:00:: the more|more%3:00:01:: 
experience|experience%2:31:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:04:: to get." 
 
"That may all be|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "but I shall be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01::

The false|false%3:00:00:: wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him carefully. 
 
"Well," he said, with a sigh, "I'm not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a magician, as I said; 
but if you will come|come%2:30:03:: to me to-morrow morning, I will stuff|stuff%2:35:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: 
with brains. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:00:: you how to use|use%2:34:01:: them, however; you must 
find|find%2:32:00:: that out|out%4:02:02:: for yourself." 
 
 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you--thank you!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "I'll find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to 
use|use%2:34:01:: them, never|never%4:02:00:: fear!" 
 
"But how about my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, anxiously. 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of courage, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "All you need|need%2:34:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: confidence|confidence%1:09:00:: in yourself. There is|be%2:42:00:: no living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: that is|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: when it faces|face%2:33:00:: danger. True|true%1:07:00:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: in facing|face%2:32:00:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: when 
you are|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and that kind|kind%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: in plenty." 
 
"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared|scar%2:35:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I 
shall really|really%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: unless you give|give%2:40:03:: me the sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: 
that makes|make%2:30:00:: one forget|forget%2:31:01:: he is|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
"Very well; I will give|give%2:40:03:: you that sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: to-morrow," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"How about my heart?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Why, as for that," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: to want|want%2:37:00:: a 
heart. It makes|make%2:30:00:: most|most%3:00:02:: people|people%1:14:00:: unhappy. If you only|only%4:02:02:: knew|know%2:31:01:: it, you are|be%2:42:03:: in 
luck|luck%1:19:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: a matter|matter%1:09:01:: of opinion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "For my 
part, I will bear|bear%2:31:00:: all the unhappiness|unhappiness%1:26:00:: without a murmur, if you will 
give|give%2:40:03:: me the heart." 
 
 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, meekly. "Come to me to-morrow and you shall 
have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. I have|have%2:40:00:: played|play%2:33:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: for so|so%4:02:02:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: that I may as 
well|well%4:02:03:: continue|continue%2:42:01:: the part|part%1:09:01:: a little|little%3:00:03:: longer." 
 
"And now," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "how am|be%2:42:06:: I to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" 
 
"We shall have|have%2:40:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about that," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "Give 
me two or three days|day%1:28:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: the matter|matter%1:09:00:: and I'll try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a

secret|secret%1:10:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: no one|one%1:23:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: a humbug." 
 
They agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: of what they had|have%2:40:00:: learned, and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to 
their rooms|room%1:06:00:: in high|high%3:00:02:: spirits. Even|even%4:02:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:39:06:: hope|hope%1:12:00:: that "The Great|great%1:18:00:: 
and Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Humbug," as she called|call%2:32:02:: him, would find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to send|send%2:38:01:: her 
back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and if he did|do%2:36:01:: that she was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: him 
everything.

Next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to his friends: 
 
"Congratulate me. I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to get|get%2:39:00:: my brains|brain%1:09:00:: at last. When I 
return|return%2:32:01:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: liked|like%2:37:04:: you as you were," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, simply. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to like|like%2:37:05:: a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely|surely%4:02:00:: you 
will think|think%2:31:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: of me when you hear|hear%2:31:00:: the splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: my new|new%3:00:00:: brain|brain%1:09:01:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to turn|turn%2:42:00:: out." Then|then%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: to them all in a cheerful|cheerful%3:00:00:: 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, where he rapped|rap%2:35:00:: upon the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in and found|find%2:39:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the 
window, engaged|engage%2:41:06:: in deep|deep%3:00:02:: thought. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my brains," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, a little|little%3:00:01:: uneasily. 
 
"Oh, yes; sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in that chair, please," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "You must 
excuse|excuse%2:32:00:: me for taking|take%2:40:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: off, but I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: it in 
order|order%1:07:00:: to put|put%2:35:05:: your brains|brain%1:08:00:: in their proper|proper%3:00:00:: place." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You are|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: welcome|welcome%3:00:00:: to 
take|take%2:35:00:: my head|head%1:08:00:: off, as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as it will be|be%2:42:03:: a better|better%3:00:02:: one|one%1:23:00:: when you put|put%2:35:00:: it 
on again." 
 
So the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: unfastened|unfasten%2:35:01:: his head|head%1:08:00:: and emptied|empty%2:29:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the straw. Then|then%4:02:00:: he 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the back|back%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:40:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: a measure|measure%1:03:00:: of bran, which he mixed|mix%2:35:00:: 
with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: pins|pin%1:06:00:: and needles. Having|have%2:39:06:: shaken|shake%2:38:00:: them together|together%4:02:02:: 
thoroughly, he filled|fill%2:30:01:: the top|top%1:15:01:: of the Scarecrow's head|head%2:42:04:: with the mixture|mixture%1:27:00:: 
and stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the space|space%1:25:00:: with straw, to hold|hold%2:42:00:: it in place. When 
he had|have%2:40:00:: fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow's head|head%2:35:00:: on his body|body%1:08:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: to him, 
 
"Hereafter you will be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 man, for I have|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: you a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of 
bran-new brains." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: both pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: and proud|proud%3:00:00:: at the fulfillment|fulfillment%1:04:00:: of his 
greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 wish, and having|have%2:39:06:: thanked|thank%2:32:00:: Oz warmly|warmly%4:02:01:: he went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him curiously. His head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: bulging|bulge%2:42:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: at 
the top|top%1:15:00:: with brains. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel?" she asked. 
 
 
 
"I feel|feel%2:37:00:: wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly. "When I get|get%2:30:00:: used|use%2:34:01:: to my 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: I shall know|know%2:31:01:: everything." 
 
"Why are|be%2:42:06:: those needles|needle%1:06:00:: and pins|pin%1:06:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out of your head?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: proof|proof%1:09:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: sharp," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well, I must go|go%2:38:00:: to Oz and get|get%2:35:03:: my heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. So he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my heart." 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "But I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in your breast, so I can put|put%2:35:05:: your heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 place. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: it 
won't hurt|hurt%1:26:00:: you." 
 
"Oh, no;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I shall not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it at all." 
 
 
 
So Oz brought|bring%2:35:00:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of tinners' shears and cut|cut%2:35:00:: a small, square|square%1:06:01:: hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in the left|left%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's breast. Then, going|go%2:38:00:: to a chest|chest%1:08:00:: 
of drawers, he took|take%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart, made|make%2:36:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with sawdust. 
 
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked. 
 
"It is, indeed!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman, who was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased. "But 
is|be%2:42:03:: it a kind|kind%1:09:00:: heart?" 
 
"Oh, very!" answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: He put|put%2:35:00:: the heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the Woodman's breast|breast%1:08:01:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: replaced|replace%2:35:00:: the square|square%1:25:00:: of tin, soldering it neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: where 
it had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: cut. 
 
"There," said|say%2:32:00:: he; "now you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that any man|man%1:18:00:: might be|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: 
of. I'm sorry I had|have%2:40:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: a patch|patch%1:06:00:: on your breast, but it really|really%4:02:03:: 
couldn't be|be%2:42:03:: helped." 
 
"Never mind|mind%1:09:00:: the patch," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the happy|happy%3:00:00:: Woodman. "I am very|very%4:02:00:: 
grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you, and shall never|never%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: your kindness." 
 
 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: of it," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends, who wished|wish%2:32:00:: him every 
joy|joy%1:12:00:: on account|account%1:10:04:: of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my courage," announced|announce%2:32:00:: the Lion, entering|enter%2:38:00:: the room. 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man; "I will get|get%2:35:03:: it for you." 
 
He went|go%2:38:00:: to a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and reaching|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to a high|high%3:00:01:: shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: took|take%2:38:10:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
a square|square%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 bottle, the contents|content%1:14:00:: of which he poured|pour%2:38:04:: into a 
green-gold dish, beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved. Placing this before the Cowardly 
Lion, who sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: at it as if he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it, the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: said, 
 
"Drink." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "if it were|be%2:42:05:: inside|inside%3:00:00:: of you, it would be|be%2:42:06:: courage. 
You know, of course, that courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: always|always%4:02:00:: inside|inside%4:02:01:: one; so that 
this really|really%4:02:03:: cannot be|be%2:42:03:: called|call%2:32:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: swallowed|swallow%2:34:00:: it. 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I advise|advise%2:32:00:: you to drink|drink%2:34:00:: it as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: hesitated|hesitate%2:42:01:: no longer, but drank|drink%2:34:00:: till the dish|dish%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: empty. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel|feel%2:29:00:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Full of courage," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion, who went|go%2:38:00:: joyfully|joyfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: to tell|tell%2:32:00:: them of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
Oz, left|leave%2:42:02:: to himself, smiled|smile%2:29:00:: to think|think%2:36:00:: of his success|success%1:04:00:: in giving|give%2:40:03:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: what they thought|think%2:31:01:: 
they wanted. "How can I help|help%2:41:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: a humbug," he said, "when all 
these people|people%1:14:00:: make|make%2:36:15:: me do|do%2:41:01:: things|thing%1:04:00:: that everybody knows|know%2:31:01:: can't be|be%2:42:03:: done? It 
was|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: happy, 
because they imagined|imagine%2:36:00:: I could do|do%2:41:01:: anything. But it will take|take%2:42:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: than 
imagination|imagination%1:09:03:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: Dorothy back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: I don't 
know|know%2:31:01:: how it can be|be%2:42:03:: done." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVII. 
 
 
For three days|day%1:28:00:: Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: from Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: These were|be%2:42:03:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
for the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, although her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and 
contented. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: them there were|be%2:42:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: in 
his head; but he would not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: what they were|be%2:42:06:: because he knew|know%2:31:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could understand|understand%2:31:00:: them but himself. When the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: about 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast; and he told|tell%2:32:04:: Dorothy 
he had|have%2:40:00:: discovered|discover%2:36:00:: it to be|be%2:42:03:: a kinder|kind%3:00:00:: and more|more%3:00:01:: tender|tender%1:18:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: than the 
one he had|have%2:40:00:: owned|own%2:40:00:: when he was|be%2:42:02:: made|make%2:30:00:: of flesh. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he was|be%2:42:06:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: on earth, and would gladly|gladly%4:02:00:: face|face%2:33:00:: an army|army%1:14:00:: of men|man%1:18:00:: or a 
dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 Kalidahs. 
 
Thus|thus%4:02:00:: each of the little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: satisfied|satisfy%2:37:00:: except Dorothy, who 
longed|long%2:37:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas. 
 
On the fourth|fourth%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day, to her great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: for her, and when she 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he said, pleasantly: 
 
"Sit down, my dear; I think|think%2:31:03:: I have|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: the way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:02:: you out of 
this country." 
 
"And back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" she asked, eagerly. 
 
"Well, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: about Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "for I haven't the 
faintest|faint%3:00:00:perceptible:00 notion|notion%1:09:02:: which way|way%1:15:00:: it lies. But the first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert, and then|then%4:02:00:: it should be|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to find|find%2:36:00:: your way|way%1:23:00:: home." 
 
"How can I cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert?" she enquired. 
 
"Well, I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you what I|i%1:23:00:: think," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "You see, 
when I came|come%2:38:04:: to this country|country%1:15:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: in a balloon. You also|also%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
through the air, being|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: by a cyclone. So I believe|believe%2:31:00:: the best|best%3:00:00:: 
way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: across the desert|desert%1:15:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: through the air. Now, it is|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: beyond my powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:36:00:: a cyclone; but I've been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: the 
matter|matter%1:09:01:: over, and I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I can make|make%2:36:01:: a balloon." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A balloon," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "is made|make%2:36:05:: of silk, which is|be%2:42:03:: coated|coat%2:29:00:: with glue|glue%1:27:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: the gas|gas%1:27:00:: in it. I have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: in the Palace, so it will 
be|be%2:42:02:: no trouble|trouble%1:11:01:: for us to make|make%2:36:00:: the balloon. But in all this country|country%1:14:01:: 
there is|be%2:42:00:: no gas|gas%1:27:02:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: with, to make|make%2:32:00:: it float." 
 
"If it won't float," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "it will be|be%2:42:03:: of no use|use%1:07:00:: to us." 
 
"True," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "But there is|be%2:42:00:: another way|way%1:04:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: it float, 
which is|be%2:42:06:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: it with hot|hot%3:00:01:: air. Hot air|air%1:27:00:: isn't as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as gas, for 
if the air|air%1:27:00:: should get|get%2:30:00:: cold|cold%3:00:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: would come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the desert, 
and we should be|be%2:42:03:: lost." 
 
"We!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the girl; "are you going|go%2:38:00:: with me?" 
 
"Yes, of course," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I am tired|tire%2:29:00:: of being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug. If I 
should go|go%2:38:01:: out of this Palace|palace%1:06:00:: my people|people%1:14:00:: would soon|soon%4:02:00:: discover|discover%2:31:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a 
Wizard, and then|then%4:02:00:: they would be|be%2:42:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: with me for having|have%2:30:00:: deceived|deceive%2:32:00:: them. 
So|so%4:02:09:: I have|have%2:40:00:: to stay|stay%2:30:00:: shut|shut%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in these rooms|room%1:06:00:: all day, and it gets|get%2:30:00:: tiresome. 
I'd much|much%4:02:00:: rather|rather%4:02:01:: go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: with you and be|be%2:42:05:: in a circus|circus%1:14:00:: again." 
 
 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: your company," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if you will help|help%2:41:00:: me sew|sew%2:35:00:: the silk|silk%1:06:00:: 
together, we will begin|begin%2:30:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: on our balloon." 
 
So Dorothy took|take%2:35:00:: a needle|needle%1:06:00:: and thread, and as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as Oz cut|cut%2:35:00:: the strips|strip%1:17:00:: 
of silk|silk%1:06:00:: into proper|proper%3:00:00:: shape|shape%1:09:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: sewed|sew%2:35:00:: them neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together. First|first%1:24:00:: 
there was|be%2:42:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of light|light%3:00:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk, then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of dark|dark%3:00:02:: green|green%1:07:00:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of emerald green; for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: a fancy|fancy%1:12:00:: to make|make%2:36:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: 
in different|different%3:00:00:: shades|shade%1:07:00:: of the color|color%1:07:00:: about them. It took|take%2:40:06:: three days|day%1:28:00:: to 
sew|sew%2:35:00:: all the strips|strip%1:17:00:: together, but when it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: they had|have%2:40:01:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
bag|bag%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than twenty feet|foot%1:23:00:: long. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz painted|paint%2:35:00:: it on the inside|inside%1:15:00:: with a coat|coat%1:06:01:: of thin|thin%3:00:01:: glue, to make|make%2:30:00:: it 
air-tight, after which he announced|announce%2:32:00:: that the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. 
 
"But we must have|have%2:40:00:: a basket|basket%1:06:00:: to ride|ride%2:38:01:: in," he said. So he sent|send%2:38:01:: the 
soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: for a big|big%3:00:01:: clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: basket, which he 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: with many|many%3:00:00:: ropes|rope%1:06:00:: to the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of the balloon. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: all ready, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: word|word%1:10:06:: to his people|people%1:14:00:: that he was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: 
to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit|visit%1:04:02:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 brother|brother%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in the clouds. 
The news|news%1:10:00:: spread|spread%2:32:02:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: throughout the city|city%1:15:00:: and everyone came|come%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sight. 
 
Oz ordered|order%2:32:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: out|out%4:02:04:: in front|front%1:15:02:: of the Palace, and the 
people|people%1:14:00:: gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it with much|much%3:00:00:: curiosity. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: a 
big|big%3:00:01:: pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood, and now|now%4:02:05:: he made|make%2:36:00:: a fire|fire%1:22:00:: of it, and Oz held|hold%2:35:01:: the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: 
of the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: over the fire|fire%1:06:00:: so that the hot|hot%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: that arose|arise%2:42:00:: from it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the silken|silken%3:00:00:bright:00 bag. Gradually|gradually%4:02:00:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: swelled|swell%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air, until finally|finally%4:02:02:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: just|just%4:02:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the ground. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz got|get%2:38:12:: into the basket|basket%1:06:00:: and said|say%2:32:00:: to all the people|people%1:14:00:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:00:: going|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit. While I am|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
will rule|rule%2:41:00:: over you. I command|command%2:32:00:: you to obey|obey%2:41:00:: him as you would me." 
 
The balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: by this time|time%1:11:00:: tugging|tug%2:35:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: at the rope|rope%1:06:00:: that held|hold%2:35:01:: it to 
the ground, for the air|air%1:27:00:: within it was|be%2:42:03:: hot, and this made|make%2:30:00:: it so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%4:02:00:: 
lighter|light%3:00:01:: in weight|weight%1:07:00:: than the air|air%1:27:00:: without that it pulled|pull%2:35:00:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: to rise|rise%2:38:00:: 
into the sky. 
 
"Come, Dorothy!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Wizard; "hurry up, or the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: will fly|fly%2:38:00:: 
away." 
 
"I can't find|find%2:40:00:: Toto anywhere," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:00:: to 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: behind. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: into the crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to bark|bark%1:11:00:: at 
a kitten, and Dorothy at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 found|find%2:40:00:: him. She picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and ran|run%2:38:00:: 
toward the balloon. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:05:: within a few|few%3:00:00:: steps|step%1:04:00:: of it, and Oz was|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: 
to help|help%2:41:00:: her into the basket, when, crack! went|go%2:38:00:: the ropes, and the 
balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: without her. 
 
 
 
"Come back!" she screamed; "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go, too!" 
 
"I can't come|come%2:38:00:: back, my dear," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz from the basket. "Good-bye!" 
 
"Good-bye!" shouted|shout%2:32:01:: everyone, and all eyes|eye%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: upward|upward%4:02:00:: to 
where the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: in the basket, rising|rise%2:38:00:: every moment|moment%1:28:00:: 
farther|far%4:02:00:: and farther|far%4:02:00:: into the sky. 
 
And that was|be%2:42:03:: the last|last%3:00:00:: any of them ever|ever%4:02:04:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: of Oz, the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Wizard, 
though he may have|have%2:40:00:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: Omaha|omaha%1:15:00:: safely, and be|be%2:42:05:: there|there%4:02:00:: now, for all we 
know. But the people|people%1:14:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:02:: him lovingly, and said|say%2:32:00:: to one another, 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: our friend. When he was|be%2:42:05:: here|here%4:02:00:: he built|build%2:36:00:: for us this 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Emerald City, and now|now%4:02:05:: he is|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:30:08:: he has|have%2:40:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: the Wise|wise%1:07:00:: 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over us." 
 
Still, for many|many%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: they grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: over the loss|loss%1:11:01:: of the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 
Wizard, and would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: comforted. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVIII. 
 
 
Dorothy wept|weep%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: at the passing|passing%1:11:02:: of her hope|hope%1:12:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: home|home%1:15:02:: to 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again; but when she thought|think%2:31:00:: it all over she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: gone|go%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. And she also|also%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:37:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: at losing|lose%2:40:02:: Oz, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: her companions. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to her and said, 
 
"Truly I should be|be%2:42:03:: ungrateful|ungrateful%3:00:00:unpleasant:00 if I failed|fail%2:41:02:: to mourn|mourn%2:37:00:: for the man|man%1:18:00:: who gave|give%2:36:00:: 
me my lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart. I should like|like%2:37:01:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: because Oz is|be%2:42:03:: gone, 
if you will kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: my tears, so that I shall not|not%4:02:00:: rust." 
 
 
 
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought|bring%2:35:00:: a towel|towel%1:06:00:: at once. Then|then%4:02:00:: 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: wept|weep%2:29:00:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 minutes, and she watched|watch%2:39:00:: the tears|tear%1:08:01:: 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: them away|away%4:02:03:: with the towel. When he had|have%2:40:01:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: 
he thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: himself thoroughly|thoroughly%4:02:00:: with his jewelled 
oil-can, to guard|guard%2:33:00:: against mishap. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of the Emerald City, and although 
he was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of him. "For," they said, 
"there is|be%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: another city|city%1:15:00:: in all the world|world%1:05:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by a 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: man." And, so|so%4:02:05:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they knew, they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: right. 
 
The morning|morning%1:28:00:: after the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: with Oz the four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: in the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and talked|talk%2:32:01:: matters|matter%1:09:01:: over. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: and the others stood|stand%2:35:00:: respectfully|respectfully%4:02:00:: before him. 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: unlucky," said|say%2:32:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: ruler; "for this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: and 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: belong|belong%2:40:00:: to us, and we can do|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we please. When 
I remember|remember%2:31:00:: that a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: ago I was|be%2:42:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a farmer's 
cornfield, and that I am|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City, I am|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: satisfied|satisfied%3:00:00:contented:00 with my lot." 
 
"I also," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, "am well|well%4:02:05:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with my new|new%3:00:00:: heart; 
and, really, that was|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I wished|wish%2:32:02:: in all the world." 
 
"For my part, I am|be%2:42:03:: content|content%1:24:00:: in knowing|know%2:31:02:: I am|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: brave|brave%2:42:00:: as any beast|beast%1:03:00:: that 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: lived, if not|not%4:02:00:: braver," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, modestly, 
 
 
 
"If Dorothy would only|only%4:02:02:: be|be%2:42:03:: contented|contented%3:00:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: in the Emerald City," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "we might all be|be%2:42:03:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: together." 
 
"But I don't want|want%2:37:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: here," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
Kansas, and live|live%2:42:08:: with Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry." 
 
"Well, then, what can be|be%2:42:03:: done?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to think, and he thought|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: that the pins|pin%1:06:00:: 
and needles|needle%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to stick|stick%2:35:03:: out of his brains. Finally|finally%4:02:02:: he said: 
 
"Why not|not%4:02:00:: call|call%2:32:01:: the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, and asked|ask%2:32:01:: them to carry|carry%2:35:02:: you over 
the desert?" 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of that!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, joyfully. "It's just|just%4:02:00:: the 
thing. I'll go|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: for the Golden Cap." 
 
When she brought|bring%2:38:00:: it into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: she spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 words, 
and soon|soon%4:02:00:: the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: through an open|open%3:00:01:: window|window%1:17:00:: 
and stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside her. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:01:: us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King, 
bowing|bow%2:38:00:: before the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. "What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish?" 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: you to fly|fly%2:38:00:: with me to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
But the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: his head. 
 
"That cannot be|be%2:42:03:: done," he said. "We belong|belong%2:40:00:: to this country|country%1:14:01:: alone, and 
cannot leave|leave%1:04:00:: it. There has|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:04:: a Winged Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: yet, 
and I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there never|never%4:02:00:: will be, for they don't belong|belong%2:42:06:: there. We 
shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to serve|serve%2:41:01:: you in any way|way%1:07:01:: in our power, but we cannot 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. Good-bye." 
 
And with another bow|bow%1:10:01:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: spread|spread%2:35:03:: his wings|wing%1:05:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the window, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: with disappointment. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: wasted|waste%2:34:00:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: to no purpose," she said, 
"for the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: cannot help|help%1:04:00:: me." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: bad!" said|say%2:32:00:: the tender|tender%1:06:02:: hearted Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again, and his head|head%1:08:00:: bulged|bulge%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: 
that Dorothy feared|fear%2:37:03:: it would burst. 
 
"Let us call|call%2:32:05:: in the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers," he said, "and 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: his advice." 
 
 
 
So the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: summoned|summon%2:32:00:: and entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room timidly, for 
while Oz was|be%2:42:03:: alive|alive%3:00:01:: he never|never%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: allowed|allow%2:41:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: than the door. 
 
"This little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the soldier, "wishes to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. How can she do|do%2:41:01:: so?" 
 
"I cannot tell," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier; "for nobody|nobody%1:18:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: 
the desert, unless it is|be%2:42:06:: Oz himself." 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: who can help|help%2:41:00:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly. 
 
"Glinda might," he suggested. 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Glinda?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the South. She is|be%2:42:03:: the most|most%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: of all the Witches, 
and rules|rule%1:26:00:: over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle|castle%1:06:02:: stands|stand%2:35:00:: on the edge|edge%1:15:00:: 
of the desert, so she may know|know%2:31:03:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Witch, isn't she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
"The Quadlings think|think%2:31:01:: she is|be%2:42:03:: good," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and she is|be%2:42:03:: kind 
to everyone. I have|have%2:40:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: that Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: woman, who knows|know%2:31:01:: 
how to keep|keep%2:42:03:: young|young%3:00:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: she has|have%2:40:00:: lived." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: to her castle?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: to the South," he answered, "but it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: 
full|full%3:00:02:ample:00 of dangers|danger%1:26:01:: to travellers. There are|be%2:42:04:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: in the woods, and 
a race|race%1:14:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 men|man%1:18:00:: who do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: their country. 
For this reason|reason%1:16:00:: none|none%1:28:00:: of the Quadlings ever|ever%4:02:04:: come|come%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:38:01:: them and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"It seems, in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of dangers, that the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: Dorothy can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
to travel|travel%2:38:00:: to the Land|land%1:26:00:: of the South|south%1:15:02:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Glinda to help|help%2:41:00:: her. For, 
of course, if Dorothy stays|stay%2:30:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: she will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"You must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I have," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I shall go|go%2:38:00:: with Dorothy," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for I am|be%2:42:03:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: of your 
city|city%1:15:00:: and long|long%3:00:02:: for the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and the country|country%1:15:01:: again. I am|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a wild|wild%3:00:02:: 
beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need|need%2:34:00:: someone|someone%1:03:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: her." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," agreed|agree%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "My axe|axe%1:06:00:: may be|be%2:42:03:: of service|service%1:07:00:: to her; 
so|so%4:02:05:: I, also, will go|go%2:38:00:: with her to the Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South." 
 
"When shall we start?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise. 
 
"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: brains. 
She lifted|lift%2:38:00:: me from the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: and brought|bring%2:38:00:: me to the 
Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. So my good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: all due|due%3:00:02:: to her, and I shall never|never%4:02:00:: 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her until she starts|start%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for good|good%3:00:01:: and all." 
 
"Thank you," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, gratefully. "You are|be%2:42:03:: all very|very%3:00:00:same:02 kind|kind%1:09:00:: to me. 
But I should like|like%2:37:01:: to start|start%2:30:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"We shall go|go%2:38:00:: to-morrow morning," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "So now|now%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: 
us all get|get%2:30:00:: ready, for it will be|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIX. 
 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: Dorothy kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: good-bye, and 
they all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers, who 
had|have%2:40:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with them as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as the gate. When the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the 
Gate|gate%1:06:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: he wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: that they could leave|leave%2:38:01:: the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: into new|new%3:00:00:: trouble. But he at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: their 
spectacles, which he put|put%2:35:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them many|many%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: wishes|wish%1:10:01:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: with them. 
 
"You are|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: our ruler," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Scarecrow; "so you must come|come%2:38:00:: 
back|back%4:02:04:: to us as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall if I am|be%2:42:03:: able," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: replied; "but I must 
help|help%2:41:00:: Dorothy to get|get%2:38:00:: home, first." 
 
As Dorothy bade|bid%2:32:01:: the good-natured|good-natured%3:00:00:: Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 farewell|farewell%1:10:00:: she said, 
 
"I have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: in your lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 City, and everyone 
has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to me. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:04:: you how grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: I am." 
 
"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like|like%2:37:01:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: you with 
us, but if it is|be%2:42:06:: your wish|wish%1:12:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: I hope|hope%2:37:01:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: a 
way." He then|then%4:02:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the outer|out%3:00:00:outer:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: forth|forth%4:02:00:: 
and started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey. 
 
The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: as our friends|friend%1:18:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: their faces|face%1:08:00:: toward the 
Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South. They were|be%2:42:03:: all in the best|best%3:00:00:: of spirits, and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: 
and chatted|chat%2:32:00:: together. Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: once|once%4:02:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with the hope|hope%1:12:01:: of 
getting|get%2:32:00:: home, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:05:: 
of use|use%1:07:00:: to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: with delight|delight%1:09:00:: 
and whisked|whisk%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: in pure|pure%3:00:02:: joy|joy%1:12:00:: at being|be%2:42:04:: in the 
country|country%1:15:00:: again, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around them and chased|chase%2:38:00:: the moths|moth%1:05:00:: and 
butterflies, barking|bark%2:32:01:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: all the time. 
 
"City life|life%1:26:01:: does|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: agree|agree%2:32:00:: with me at all," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion, as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: at a brisk|brisk%3:00:00:energetic:00 pace. "I have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: since I lived|live%2:42:08:: 
there, and now|now%4:02:05:: I am|be%2:42:04:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 for a chance|chance%1:26:00:: to show|show%2:39:02:: the other|other%3:00:00:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: how 
courageous|courageous%3:00:04:: I have|have%2:40:00:: grown." 
 
 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and took|take%2:39:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 look|look%1:04:00:: at the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. All they 
could see|see%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: a mass|mass%1:14:02:: of towers|tower%1:06:00:: and steeples|steeple%1:06:00:: behind the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 walls, 
and high|high%3:00:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: above everything the spires|spire%1:06:00:: and dome|dome%1:06:00:: of the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard, after all," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast. 
 
"He knew|know%2:31:03:: how to give|give%2:40:03:: me brains, and very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: brains, too," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"If Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:39:00:: a dose|dose%1:06:00:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: he gave|give%2:40:03:: me," added|add%2:32:01:: the 
Lion, "he would have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. Oz had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: kept|keep%2:41:03:: the promise|promise%1:10:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: her, but he 
had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: man, 
even|even%4:02:01:: if he was|be%2:42:03:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard. 
 
The first|first%3:00:00:: day's journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: through the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: and bright|bright%3:00:02:: 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that stretched|stretch%2:42:00:: about the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: on every side. They 
slept|sleep%2:29:00:: that night|night%1:28:00:: on the grass, with nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the stars|star%1:17:01:: over them; 
and they rested|rest%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: indeed. 
 
In the morning|morning%1:28:00:: they travelled|travel%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 wood. There 
was|be%2:42:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: of going|go%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: it, for it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to extend|extend%2:42:01:: to the right|right%1:15:00:: and 
left|leave%2:31:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see; and, besides, they did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: change|change%1:04:00:: 
the direction|direction%1:15:00:: of their journey|journey%1:04:00:: for fear|fear%1:12:00:: of getting|get%2:30:00:: lost. So they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
for the place|place%1:15:00:: where it would be|be%2:42:03:: easiest|easy%3:00:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: into the forest. 
 
The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: in the lead, finally|finally%4:02:00:: discovered|discover%2:39:03:: a big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: 
with such|such%3:00:00:much:00 wide|wide%3:00:00:: spreading-branches that there was|be%2:42:03:: room|room%1:23:00:: for the party|party%1:14:00:: 
to pass|pass%2:38:00:: underneath. So he walked|walk%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: to the tree, but just|just%4:02:05:: as he 
came|come%2:38:00:: under the first|first%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: they bent|bent%3:00:00:damaged:00 down and twined|twin%2:35:00:: around him, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 minute|minute%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: from the ground|ground%1:17:00:: and flung headlong|headlong%4:02:00:: 
among his fellow travellers. 
 
This did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:37:00:: the Scarecrow, but it surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: him, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: dizzy|dizzy%3:00:00:ill:01 when Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up. 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:04:: another space|space%1:15:00:: between the trees," called|call%2:32:09:: the Lion. 
 
 
 
"Let me try|try%2:41:00:: it first," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me to 
get|get%2:30:00:: thrown|throw%2:35:00:: about." He walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to another tree, as he spoke, but its 
branches|branch%1:17:01:: immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: him and tossed|toss%2:35:04:: him back|back%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: strange," exclaimed Dorothy; "what shall we do?" 
 
"The trees|tree%1:20:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:42:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: us, and stop|stop%2:41:00:: our 
journey," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I will try|try%2:41:00:: it myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, and shouldering|shoulder%2:35:02:: 
his axe|axe%1:06:00:: he marched|march%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the first|first%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: that had|have%2:40:00:: handled|handle%2:35:01:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: so roughly. When a big|big%3:00:01:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to seize|seize%2:35:00:: him the 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: at it so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that he cut|cut%2:35:00:: it in two. At once|once%4:02:02:: 
the tree|tree%1:20:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: shaking|shake%2:38:00:: all its branches|branch%1:20:00:: as if in pain, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: under it. 
 
"Come on!" he shouted|shout%2:32:00:: to the others; "be quick!" 
 
They all ran|run%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: and passed|pass%2:38:00:: under the tree|tree%1:20:00:: without injury, except 
Toto, who was|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: by a small|small%3:00:00:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: and shaken|shake%2:38:00:: until he howled. But 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: promptly|promptly%4:02:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: the branch|branch%1:20:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: free. 
 
The other|other%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: them back, so they 
made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the first|first%3:00:00:: row|row%1:14:00:: of trees|tree%1:20:00:: could bend|bend%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
their branches, and that probably|probably%4:02:00:: these were|be%2:42:06:: the policemen|policeman%1:18:00:: of the 
forest, and given|give%2:40:03:: this wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: in order|order%1:26:02:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of it. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with ease|ease%1:07:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: 
to the further|further%3:00:00:far:00 edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found|find%2:40:02:: 
before them a high|high%3:00:01:: wall, which seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of white|white%3:00:01:: china. It was|be%2:42:06:: 
smooth, like the surface|surface%1:06:00:: of a dish, and higher|high%3:00:01:: than their heads. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"I will make|make%2:36:00:: a ladder," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for we certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: must 
climb|climb%1:04:00:: over the wall." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XX. 
 
 
While the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: making|make%2:36:01:: a ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: from wood|wood%1:27:00:: which he found|find%2:40:02:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and slept, for she was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: by the long|long%3:00:02:: walk. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: curled|curl%2:30:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: beside him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: watched|watch%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: while he worked, and said|say%2:32:00:: to him: 
 
"I cannot think|think%2:31:00:: why this wall|wall%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: here, nor what it is|be%2:42:06:: made|make%2:42:05:: of." 
 
"Rest your brains|brain%1:09:01:: and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: worry|worry%2:37:12:: about the wall," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman; "when we have|have%2:40:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: over it we shall know|know%2:31:01:: what is|be%2:42:05:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
After a time|time%1:28:05:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: finished. It looked|look%2:39:01:: clumsy, but the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and would answer|answer%2:32:00:: their purpose. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: waked|wake%2:29:02:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto, and told|tell%2:32:04:: them that the 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: first, but he 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: awkward|awkward%3:00:00:inconvenient:00 that Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: behind|behind%4:02:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: him 
from falling|fall%2:38:03:: off. When he got|get%2:30:02:: his head|head%1:08:00:: over the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Oh, my!" 
 
"Go on," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: up and sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the 
wall, and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: over and cried, 
 
"Oh, my!" just|just%4:02:05:: as the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: done. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Toto came|come%2:38:00:: up, and immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark, but Dorothy made|make%2:36:12:: 
him be|be%2:42:03:: still. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: next, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: last; but 
both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they looked|look%2:39:00:: over the wall. 
When they were|be%2:42:05:: all sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in a row|row%1:14:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: they 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: a strange|strange%3:00:00:: sight. 
 
 
 
Before them was|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 stretch|stretch%1:17:00:: of country|country%1:15:01:: having|have%2:42:00:: a floor|floor%1:06:00:: as smooth|smooth%1:04:00:: 
and shining|shin%2:38:00:: and white|white%3:00:01:: as the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: platter. Scattered|scatter%2:35:00:: 
around were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of china|china%1:06:00:: and painted|paint%2:35:00:: in the 
brightest|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 colours. These houses|house%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: small, the biggest|big%3:00:01:: of them 
reaching|reach%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: high|high%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's waist. There were|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
little|little%3:00:01:: barns, with china|china%1:06:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: around them, and many|many%3:00:00:: cows|cow%1:05:01:: and sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: 
and horses|horse%1:05:00:: and pigs|pig%1:05:00:: and chickens, all made|make%2:42:05:: of china, were|be%2:42:04:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: 
about in groups. 
 
But the strangest|strange%3:00:00:: of all were|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in this queer|queer%1:18:00:: 
country. There were|be%2:42:03:: milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored 
bodices|bodice%1:06:00:: and golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:07:01:: all over their gowns; and princesses|princess%1:18:00:: with 
most|most%4:02:01:: gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frocks|frock%1:06:00:: of silver|silver%1:27:00:: and gold|gold%1:27:00:: and purple; and shepherds|shepherd%1:18:00:: 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in knee-breeches with pink|pink%1:07:00:: and yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 stripes|stripe%1:06:00:: down 
them, and golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 buckles|buckle%1:06:00:: on their shoes; and princes|prince%1:18:00:: with jewelled|jewel%2:36:00:: 
crowns|crown%1:06:01:: upon their heads, wearing|wear%2:29:00:: ermine|ermine%1:27:00:: robes|robe%1:06:01:: and satin doublets; and 
funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 clowns|clown%1:18:00:: in ruffled|ruffle%2:37:01:: gowns, with round|round%3:00:00:: red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:15:01:: upon their cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: 
and tall, pointed|point%2:32:00:: caps. And, strangest of all, these people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
made|make%2:42:05:: of china, even|even%4:02:00:: to their clothes, and were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that the 
tallest|tall%3:00:00:: of them was|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: higher|high%3:00:01:: than Dorothy's knee. 
 
No one|one%1:23:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: so|so%4:02:07:: much|much%3:00:00:: as look|look%1:07:01:: at the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: at first, except one 
little|little%3:00:01:: purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 china|china%1:06:00:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: with an extra-large head, which came|come%2:38:00:: to the 
wall|wall%1:06:00:: and barked|bark%2:32:01:: at them in a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 voice, afterwards|afterwards%4:02:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"How shall we get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
They found|find%2:39:02:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: pull|pull%2:35:00:: it up, so the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: the wall|wall%1:06:00:: and the others jumped|jump%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon him so|so%4:02:09:: 
that the hard|hard%3:00:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: their feet. Of course|course%1:15:00:: they took|take%2:31:03:: 
pains|pain%1:18:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to light|light%2:38:00:: on his head|head%1:08:00:: and get|get%2:30:02:: the pins|pin%1:06:00:: in their feet. When 
all were|be%2:42:03:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: down they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, whose body|body%1:08:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: flattened|flatten%2:30:00:: out, and patted|pat%2:35:00:: his straw|straw%1:27:00:: into shape|shape%1:07:00:: again. 
 
"We must cross|cross%2:38:00:: this strange|strange%3:00:00:: place|place%1:15:00:: in order|order%1:07:00:: to get|get%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "for it would be|be%2:42:03:: unwise|unwise%3:00:00:foolish:00 for us to go|go%2:41:00:: any other|other%3:00:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: 
except due|due%3:00:02:: South." 
 
They began|begin%2:30:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the country|country%1:15:02:: of the china|china%1:06:00:: people, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to was|be%2:42:06:: a china|china%1:06:00:: milk-maid milking|milk%2:30:00:: a china|china%1:06:00:: cow. 
As they drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the cow|cow%1:05:01:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a kick|kick%1:04:00:: and kicked|kick%2:38:00:: over the 
stool, the pail, and even|even%4:02:00:: the milk-maid herself, all falling|fall%2:38:00:: on the 
china|china%1:06:00:: ground|ground%1:27:00:: with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clatter. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: shocked|shock%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:31:01:: that the cow|cow%1:05:01:: had|have%2:30:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg|leg%1:08:01:: short|short%3:00:01:: off, 
and that the pail|pail%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in several|several%3:00:00:some:00 small|small%3:00:00:: pieces, while the poor|poor%3:00:00:: 
milk-maid had|have%2:40:00:: a nick|nick%1:07:00:: in her left|left%3:00:00:: elbow. 
 
"There!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the milk-maid, angrily; "see what you have|have%2:40:00:: done! My 
cow|cow%1:05:01:: has|have%2:42:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg, and I must take|take%2:38:09:: her to the mender's shop|shop%1:06:00:: 
and have|have%2:30:00:: it glued|glue%2:35:00:: on again. What do|do%2:36:00:: you mean|mean%2:32:01:: by coming|come%2:38:04:: here|here%4:02:01:: and 
frightening|frightening%3:00:00:alarming:00 my cow?" 
 
"I'm very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sorry," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy; "please forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: us." 
 
But the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: milk-maid was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: vexed|vex%2:31:02:: to make|make%2:41:00:: any answer. She

limping|limp%2:38:00:: on three legs. As she left|leave%2:31:05:: them the milk-maid cast|cast%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: 
reproachful|reproachful%3:00:00:unfavorable:02 glances|glance%1:04:00:: over her shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: at the clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 strangers, 
holding|hold%2:35:00:: her nicked|nick%2:35:01:: elbow|elbow%1:08:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: to her side. 
 
 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: at this mishap. 
 
"We must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: here," said|say%2:32:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 Woodman, "or we 
may hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: these pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: so they will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:30:00:: over it." 
 
A little|little%3:00:01:: farther|far%4:02:00:: on Dorothy met|meet%2:38:01:: a most|most%4:02:01:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: young|young%3:00:00:: 
princess, who stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%4:02:04:: as she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and started|start%2:38:04:: to 
run|run%2:38:04:: away. 
 
Dorothy wanted|want%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: of the Princess, so she ran|run%2:38:00:: after her; but 
the china|china%1:06:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
"Don't chase me! don't chase me!" 
 
She had|have%2:40:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 little|little%3:00:01:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: that Dorothy stopped|stop%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"Why not?" 
 
"Because," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the princess, also|also%4:02:00:: stopping, a safe|safe%3:00:01:: distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
away, "if I run|run%2:38:00:: I may fall|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and break|break%2:29:04:: myself." 
 
"But couldn't you be|be%2:42:03:: mended?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh, yes; but one is|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: after being|be%2:42:03:: mended, you know," 
replied|reply%2:32:00:: the princess. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: not," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Now there is|be%2:42:04:: Mr.|mr.%1:10:00:: Joker, one of our clowns," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the china|china%1:06:00:: 
lady, "who is|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: upon his head. He has|have%2:40:00:: broken|break%2:41:00:: 
himself so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in a hundred places, and doesn't 
look|look%2:39:01:: at all pretty. Here|here%4:02:00:: he comes|come%2:38:00:: now, so you can see|see%2:39:00:: for yourself." 
 
Indeed, a jolly|jolly%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Clown|clown%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: toward them, and 
Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: that in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of his pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of red|red%1:07:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: completely|completely%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with cracks, running|run%2:38:01:: every 
which way|way%1:07:01:: and showing|show%2:39:00:: plainly|plainly%4:02:00:: that he had|have%2:40:01:: been|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in many|many%3:00:00:: places. 
 
The Clown|clown%1:18:01:: put|put%2:35:05:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: in his pockets, and after puffing|puff%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his

Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: I. 
 
 
Dorothy lived|live%2:42:08:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: prairies, with Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: 
Henry, who was|be%2:42:03:: a farmer, and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, who was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer's wife. 
Their house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: small, for the lumber|lumber%1:27:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: it had|have%2:40:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:38:10:: 
by wagon|wagon%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles. There were|be%2:42:04:: four walls, a floor|floor%1:06:00:: and a roof, 
which made|make%2:42:05:: one room; and this room|room%1:06:00:: contained|contain%2:42:00:: a rusty|rusty%3:00:00:rusted:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
stove, a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, 
and the beds. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in one corner, 
and Dorothy a little|little%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in another corner. There was|be%2:42:00:: no garret|garret%1:06:00:: at 
all, and no cellar--except a small|small%3:00:00:: hole, dug|dig%2:35:01:: in the ground, called|call%2:32:02:: a 
cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: cellar, where the family|family%1:14:02:: could go|go%2:38:00:: in case|case%1:26:00:: one of those great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
whirlwinds|whirlwind%1:19:00:: arose, mighty|mighty%4:02:00:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 to crush|crush%2:30:00:: any building|building%1:06:00:: in its path. It 
was|be%2:42:03:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: by a trap-door in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the floor, from which a 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into the small, dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. 
 
When Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the doorway|doorway%1:06:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: around, she could see|see%2:39:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairie|prairie%1:15:00:: on every side. Not|not%4:02:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: nor a 
house|house%1:14:03:: broke|break%2:38:01:: the broad|broad%3:00:04:: sweep|sweep%1:07:00:: of flat|flat%3:00:00:even:01 country|country%1:15:01:: that reached|reach%2:38:00:: the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: in all directions. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: baked|baked%3:00:00:dry:01 the plowed|plow%2:36:00:: land|land%1:17:01:: into a 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 mass, with little|little%3:00:01:: cracks|crack%1:17:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through it. Even|even%4:02:00:: the grass|grass%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: green, for the sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: burned|burn%2:30:02:: the tops|top%1:15:01:: of the long|long%3:00:01:: blades|blade%1:20:00:: until 
they were|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:02:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. Once the house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: painted, but the sun|sun%1:17:00:: blistered|blister%2:30:01:: the paint|paint%1:06:00:: and the rains|rain%1:19:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: it 
away, and now|now%4:02:05:: the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: as dull|dull%3:00:00:unsaturated:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as everything else. 
 
 
When Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: came|come%2:38:04:: there|there%4:02:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: she was|be%2:42:03:: a young, pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 wife. The 
sun|sun%1:19:00:: and wind|wind%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: changed|change%2:30:01:: her, too. They had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the sparkle|sparkle%1:07:01:: from 
her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and left|leave%2:42:02:: them a sober|sober%3:00:00:serious:00 gray; they had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: the red|red%1:07:00:: from her 
cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: and lips, and they were|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 also. She was|be%2:42:03:: thin|thin%3:00:03:: and gaunt, 
and never|never%4:02:00:: smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: an orphan, first|first%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:04:: 
to her, Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: by the child's laughter|laughter%1:10:00:: that 
she would scream|scream%2:32:01:: and press|press%2:35:00:: her hand|hand%1:08:00:: upon her heart|heart%1:09:00:: whenever Dorothy's 
merry|merry%3:00:02:joyous:00 voice|voice%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: her ears; and she still|still%4:02:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: that she could find|find%2:40:02:: anything to laugh|laugh%1:10:00:: at. 
 
Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: laughed. He worked|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: from morning|morning%1:28:00:: till night|night%1:28:00:: and 
did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: what joy|joy%1:12:00:: was. He was|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:old:02 also, from his long|long%3:00:01:: beard|beard%1:08:00:: to 
his rough|rough%3:00:00:: boots, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: stern|stern%3:00:00:implacable:00 and solemn, and rarely|rarely%4:02:00:: spoke. 
 
It was|be%2:42:06:: Toto that made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy laugh, and saved|save%2:41:01:: her from growing|grow%2:30:00:: as 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as her other|other%3:00:00:: surroundings. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: gray; he was|be%2:42:03:: a little|little%3:00:01:: 
black|black%3:00:01:: dog, with long, silky|silky%3:00:00:bright:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and small|small%3:00:00:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that twinkled|twinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on either side|side%1:15:02:: of his funny, wee nose. Toto played|play%2:41:03:: all day|day%1:28:00:: 
long, and Dorothy played|play%2:41:03:: with him, and loved|love%2:37:00:: him dearly. 
 
 
 
To-day, however, they were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: playing. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: upon the 
door-step and looked|look%2:39:00:: anxiously|anxiously%4:02:00:: at the sky, which was|be%2:42:03:: even|even%4:02:00:: grayer|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 than 
usual. Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the door|door%1:06:01:: with Toto in her arms, and looked|look%2:39:00:: at 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: too. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: washing|wash%2:35:00:: the dishes. 
 
From the far|far%3:00:00:: north|north%1:24:00:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 wail|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, and Uncle|uncle%1:18:01:: 
Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: where the long|long%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: in waves|wave%1:11:01:: 
before the coming|come%2:30:01:: storm. There now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:30:01:: a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 whistling|whistling%1:11:00:: in the 
air|air%1:27:00:: from the south, and as they turned|turn%2:38:00:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that way|way%1:15:00:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: 
ripples|ripple%1:11:00:: in the grass|grass%1:20:00:: coming|come%2:38:00:: from that direction|direction%1:15:00:: also. 
 
Suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up. 
 
"There's a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: coming, Em," he called|call%2:32:09:: to his wife; "I'll go|go%2:38:00:: look|look%1:04:00:: 
after the stock." Then|then%4:02:00:: he ran|run%2:38:00:: toward the sheds|shed%1:06:00:: where the cows|cow%1:05:01:: and 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: kept. 
 
Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: dropped|drop%2:30:01:: her work|work%1:04:00:: and came|come%2:38:00:: to the door. One glance|glance%1:04:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: her of 
the danger|danger%1:26:00:: close|close%1:28:00:: at hand. 
 
"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed; "run for the cellar!" 
 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: out of Dorothy's arms|arm%1:08:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: under the bed, and the 
girl|girl%1:18:02:: started|start%2:30:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, badly|badly%4:02:02:: frightened, threw|throw%2:35:00:: open|open%3:00:01:: the 
trap-door in the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: into the small, 
dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. Dorothy caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto at last, and started|start%2:30:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: her 
aunt. When she was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%3:00:00:incomplete:00 way|way%1:15:00:: across the room|room%1:06:00:: there came|come%2:30:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 shriek|shriek%1:10:00:: 
from the wind, and the house|house%1:06:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:00:strong:00 that she lost|lose%2:40:02:: her footing|footing%1:26:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: upon the floor. 
 
A strange|strange%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: happened. 
 
The house|house%1:06:00:: whirled|whirl%2:38:01:: around two or three times|time%1:11:00:: and rose|rise%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: through 
the air. Dorothy felt|feel%2:29:00:: as if she were|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. 
 
The north|north%1:24:00:: and south|south%1:24:00:: winds|wind%1:19:00:: met|meet%2:42:02:: where the house|house%1:06:00:: stood, and made|make%2:36:00:: it the 
exact|exact%3:00:00:: center|center%1:15:01:: of the cyclone. In the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:26:00:: the air|air%1:27:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
generally|generally%4:02:02:: still, but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pressure|pressure%1:07:00:: of the wind|wind%1:19:00:: on every side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the house|house%1:06:00:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: it up|up%4:02:00:: higher|high%3:00:01:: and higher, until it was|be%2:42:03:: at the very|very%4:02:00:: 
top|top%1:15:00:: of the cyclone; and there it remained|remain%2:42:01:: and was|be%2:42:05:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: and 
miles|mile%1:23:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as you could carry|carry%2:35:02:: a feather. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: dark, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: howled|howl%2:32:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: around her, but 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:10:: she was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. After the first|first%3:00:00:: few|few%3:00:00:: whirls|whirl%1:25:00:: 
around, and one other|other%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: tipped|tip%2:40:00:: badly, she felt|feel%2:37:00:: as 
if she were|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: rocked|rock%2:38:00:: gently, like a baby|baby%1:18:00:: in a cradle. 
 
Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it. He ran|run%2:38:00:: about the room, now|now%4:02:05:: here, now|now%4:02:05:: there, 
barking|bark%2:32:00:: loudly; but Dorothy sat|sit%2:35:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: still|still%4:02:02:: on the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: 
to see|see%2:31:08:: what would happen. 
 
Once Toto got|get%2:30:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: near the open|open%3:00:01:: trap-door, and fell|fall%2:38:03:: in; and at first|first%3:00:00:: 
the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she had|have%2:39:06:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: him. But soon|soon%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: one of his 
ears|ear%1:08:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: through the hole, for the strong|strong%3:00:00:: pressure|pressure%1:19:00:: of the air|air%1:27:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: keeping|keep%2:42:00:: him up|up%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:06:: that he could not|not%4:02:00:: fall. She crept|creep%2:38:00:: to the hole, 
caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto by the ear, and dragged|drag%2:35:00:: him into the room|room%1:06:00:: again; afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: 
closing|close%2:35:00:: the trap-door so that no more|more%3:00:02:: accidents|accident%1:11:01:: could happen. 
 
Hour|hour%1:28:00:: after hour|hour%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: away, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: Dorothy got|get%2:30:00:: over her fright; 
but she felt|feel%2:37:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: lonely, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: shrieked|shriek%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: all about 
her that she nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: deaf. At first|first%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: if she 
would be|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:38:00:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:40:05:: again; but as the hours|hour%1:28:01:: 
passed|pass%2:38:03:: and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 happened, she stopped|stop%2:42:00:: worrying|worry%2:37:00:: and 
resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: calmly|calmly%4:02:00:: and see|see%2:31:08:: what the future|future%1:28:00:: would bring. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 
she crawled|crawl%2:38:00:: over the swaying|sway%2:38:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: to her bed, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon it; 
and Toto followed|follow%2:38:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside her. 
 
In spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the swaying of the house|house%1:06:00:: and the wailing|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, 
Dorothy soon|soon%4:02:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: asleep. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: II. 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by a shock, so|so%4:02:02:: sudden|sudden%3:00:00:: and severe|severe%3:00:00:strong:00 that if Dorothy 
had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: she might have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: hurt. As it 
was, the jar|jar%1:06:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: her catch|catch%2:40:00:: her breath|breath%1:27:00:: and wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: what had|have%2:40:00:: happened; 
and Toto put|put%2:35:00:: his cold|cold%3:00:02:: little|little%3:00:01:: nose|nose%1:08:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: and whined|whine%2:32:01:: dismally. 
Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: that the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: moving; nor was|be%2:42:03:: it 
dark, for the bright|bright%3:00:00:light:06 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: at the window, flooding|flood%2:35:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: room. She sprang|spring%2:38:01:: from her bed|bed%1:06:00:: and with Toto at her heels|heel%1:08:00:: ran|run%2:38:08:: 
and opened|open%2:35:00:: the door. 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a cry|cry%1:10:00:: of amazement|amazement%1:12:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: about her, her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: and bigger|big%3:00:01:: at the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sights|sight%1:10:00:: she saw. 
 
The cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: down, very|very%4:02:00:: gently--for a cyclone--in 
the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a country|country%1:15:00:: of marvelous|marvelous%3:00:00:incredible:00 beauty. There were|be%2:42:04:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 patches|patch%1:06:00:: 
of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sward|sward%1:17:00:: all about, with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 trees|tree%1:20:00:: bearing|bear%2:36:00:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and 
luscious|luscious%3:00:00:sexy:00 fruits. Banks|bank%1:17:00:: of gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: on every hand, and 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: with rare|rare%3:00:00:scarce:00 and brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 plumage|plumage%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: and fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: in the trees|tree%1:20:00:: 
and bushes. A|a%1:08:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: was|be%2:42:04:: a small|small%3:00:00:: brook, rushing|rush%2:30:00:: and sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 
along between green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 banks, and murmuring|murmur%2:32:00:: in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to 
a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: on the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairies. 
 
While she stood|stand%2:35:00:: looking|look%2:39:00:: eagerly|eagerly%4:02:00:: at the strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: sights, 
she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: coming|come%2:38:00:: toward her a group|group%1:03:00:: of the queerest|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 people|people%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: seen. They were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as the grown|grown%3:00:00:mature:01 folk|folk%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
used|use%2:34:02:: to; but neither were|be%2:42:03:: they very|very%4:02:00:: small. In fact, they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: about 
as|as%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: as Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: a well-grown child|child%1:18:00:: for her age, although 
they were, so|so%4:02:07:: far|far%4:02:00:: as looks|look%1:07:00:: go, many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: older. 
 
 
 
Three were|be%2:42:03:: men|man%1:18:00:: and one a woman, and all were|be%2:42:03:: oddly|oddly%4:02:00:: dressed. They wore|wear%2:29:00:: 
round|round%1:04:03:: hats|hat%1:06:00:: that rose|rise%2:38:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: point|point%1:25:00:: a foot|foot%1:23:00:: above their heads, with 
little|little%3:00:01:: bells|bell%1:06:00:: around the brims|brim%1:06:00:: that tinkled|tinkle%2:39:00:: sweetly|sweetly%4:02:00:: as they moved. The 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: of the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: blue; the little|little%3:00:01:: woman's hat|hat%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: white, and she 
wore|wear%2:29:00:: a white|white%3:00:01:: gown|gown%1:06:00:: that hung|hang%2:35:00:: in plaits|plait%1:08:00:: from her shoulders; over it were|be%2:42:03:: 
sprinkled|sprinkle%2:35:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: stars|star%1:17:01:: that glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: like diamonds. The men|man%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in blue, of the same|same%3:00:02:: shade|shade%1:07:00:: as their hats, and wore|wear%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: 
polished|polished%3:00:00:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with a deep|deep%3:00:00:colorful:00 roll|roll%1:25:00:: of blue|blue%1:07:00:: at the tops. The men, Dorothy 
thought, were|be%2:42:03:: about as|as%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: as Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry, for two of them had|have%2:40:00:: beards. 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: doubtless much|much%3:00:00:: older: her face|face%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: 
with wrinkles, her hair|hair%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: white, and she walked|walk%2:38:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: stiffly. 
 
When these people|people%1:14:00:: drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the house|house%1:06:00:: where Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: in 
the doorway, they paused|pause%2:32:01:: and whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: among themselves, as if afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: farther. But the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to Dorothy, made|make%2:32:00:: 
a low|low%3:00:01:: bow|bow%1:10:01:: and said, in a sweet|sweet%3:00:00:melodious:00 voice, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: welcome, most|most%4:02:00:: noble|noble%3:00:01:: Sorceress, to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins. 
We are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for having|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and for setting|set%2:30:01:: our people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage." 
 
 
 
Dorothy listened|listen%2:39:00:: to this speech|speech%1:10:01:: with wonder. What could the little|little%3:00:01:: 
woman|woman%1:18:00:: possibly|possibly%4:02:00:: mean|mean%2:32:01:: by calling|call%2:32:02:: her a sorceress, and saying|say%2:32:00:: she 
had|have%2:41:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East? Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: an innocent, 
harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: by a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
from home; and she had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything in all her life. 
 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: expected|expect%2:32:00:: her to answer; so Dorothy 
said, with hesitation, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind; but there must be|be%2:42:00:: some mistake. I have|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:42:00:: 
anything." 
 
"Your house|house%1:06:00:: did, anyway," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, with a laugh; 
"and that is|be%2:42:06:: the same|same%3:00:02:: thing. See!" she continued, pointing|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:15:02:: of the house; "there are|be%2:42:04:: her two toes, still|still%4:02:01:: sticking|stick%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: from 
under a block|block%1:06:00:: of wood." 
 
Dorothy looked, and gave|give%2:41:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fright. There, indeed, just|just%4:02:01:: 
under the corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beam|beam%1:06:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: rested|rest%2:35:00:: on, two feet|foot%1:23:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out, shod in silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: with pointed|pointed%3:00:00:: toes. 
 
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clasping|clasp%2:35:00:: her hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: in 
dismay; "the house|house%1:06:00:: must have|have%2:29:02:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on her. What ever|ever%4:02:04:: shall we do?" 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to be|be%2:42:00:: done," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman, calmly. 
 
 
 
"But who was|be%2:42:06:: she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East, as I said," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "She has|have%2:40:00:: held|hold%2:42:00:: all the Munchkins in bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: for many|many%3:00:00:: 
years, making|make%2:36:00:: them slave|slave%1:18:00:: for her night|night%1:28:00:: and day. Now|now%1:28:00:: they are|be%2:42:03:: all set|set%1:14:00:: 
free, and are|be%2:42:03:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for the favour." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Munchkins?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in this land|land%1:15:02:: of the East, where the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:intense:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: ruled." 
 
"Are you a Munchkin?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but I am|be%2:42:06:: their friend, although I live|live%2:42:08:: in the land|land%1:15:01:: of the North. 
When they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: the Munchkins sent|send%2:38:01:: a swift|swift%1:05:00:: 
messenger|messenger%1:18:00:: to me, and I came|come%2:38:00:: at once. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North." 
 
"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy; "are you a real|real%3:00:00:: witch?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "But I am|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: witch, and 
the people|people%1:14:01:: love|love%2:37:01:: me. I am|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: who 
ruled|rule%2:41:00:: here, or I should have|have%2:41:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: myself." 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:01:: all witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: wicked," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%1:23:00:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at facing|face%2:32:00:: a real|real%3:00:00:: witch. 
 
"Oh, no; that is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake. There were|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: four witches|witch%1:18:03:: in all 
the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz, and two of them, those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:00:: and the 
South, are|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: witches. I know|know%2:31:02:: this is|be%2:42:03:: true, for I am|be%2:42:06:: one of them 
myself, and cannot be|be%2:42:03:: mistaken. Those who dwelt|dwell%2:42:00:: in the East|east%1:15:00:: and the 
West|west%1:15:01:: were, indeed, wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witches; but now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: one 
of them, there is|be%2:42:00:: but one wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz--the one|one%1:23:00:: 
who lives|live%2:42:06:: in the West." 
 
"But," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em|em%1:23:01:: has|have%2:40:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: me 
that the witches|witch%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all dead--years and years|year%1:28:01:: ago." 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em?" inquired|inquire%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman. 
 
"She is|be%2:42:06:: my aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: who lives|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, where I came|come%2:42:09:: from." 
 
The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: for a time, with her head|head%1:08:00:: 
bowed|bow%2:38:00:: and her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: upon the ground. Then|then%4:02:00:: she looked|look%2:39:00:: up and said, 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: where Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: is, for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: that country|country%1:15:00:: 
mentioned|mention%2:32:00:: before. But tell|tell%2:32:00:: me, is|be%2:42:03:: it a civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: country?" 
 
"Oh, yes;" replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then that accounts|account%2:42:01:: for it. In|in%1:15:00:: the civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: countries|country%1:14:00:: I believe|believe%2:31:04:: 
there are|be%2:42:00:: no witches|witch%1:18:00:: left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor 
magicians. But, you see, the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz has|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: civilized, for 
we are|be%2:42:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: from all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the world. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: we still|still%4:02:01:: 
have|have%2:32:00:: witches|witch%1:18:00:: and wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: amongst us." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Wizards?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oz himself is|be%2:42:06:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Witch, sinking|sink%2:38:02:: her 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: to a whisper. "He is|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: than all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of us 
together. He lives|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:02:: another question, but just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: the Munchkins, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: by, gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: shout|shout%1:10:00:: and pointed|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:06:00:: of the house|house%1:06:00:: where the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying. 
 
 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman; and looked, and began|begin%2:30:01:: 
to laugh. The feet|foot%1:08:01:: of the dead|dead%3:00:01:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: disappeared|disappear%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: and 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:42:03:: but the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: old," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North, "that she dried|dry%2:30:01:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: quickly|quickly%4:02:00:: in the sun. That is|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of her. But the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: yours, and you shall have|have%2:40:00:: them to wear." She reached|reach%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and 
picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the shoes, and after shaking|shake%2:38:00:: the dust|dust%1:27:00:: out of them handed|hand%2:40:00:: 
them to Dorothy. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of those silver|silver%3:00:00:metallic:00 shoes," said|say%2:32:00:: one of 
the Munchkins; "and there is|be%2:42:03:: some charm|charm%1:07:00:: connected|connect%2:31:00:: with them; but what 
it is|be%2:42:06:: we never|never%4:02:00:: knew." 
 
Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: into the house|house%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: them on the 
table. Then|then%4:02:00:: she came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: to the Munchkins and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: and Uncle, for I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they 
will worry|worry%2:37:00:: about me. Can you help|help%2:41:00:: me find|find%2:40:00:: my way?" 
 
The Munchkins and the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: first|first%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at one another, and then|then%4:02:00:: at 
Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads. 
 
"At the East, not|not%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from here," said|say%2:32:00:: one, "there is|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert, 
and none|none%1:28:00:: could live|live%2:42:04:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the South," said|say%2:32:00:: another, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there 
and seen|see%2:39:02:: it. The South|south%1:15:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings." 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: told," said|say%2:32:00:: the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 man, "that it is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the West. And 
that country, where the Winkies live, is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the West, who would make|make%2:30:00:: you her slave|slave%1:18:00:: if you passed|pass%2:38:05:: her way." 
 
"The North|north%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my home," said|say%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: lady, "and at its edge|edge%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: the 
same|same%3:00:02:: great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert|desert%1:15:00:: that surrounds|surround%2:35:00:: this land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: I'm afraid, my 
dear, you will have|have%2:39:06:: to live|live%2:42:08:: with us." 
 
Dorothy began|begin%2:30:00:: to sob, at this, for she felt|feel%2:37:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 among all 
these strange|strange%3:00:00:: people. Her tears|tear%1:08:01:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to grieve|grieve%2:37:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 
Munchkins, for they immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: their handkerchiefs|handkerchief%1:06:00:: and 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep also. As for the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her 
cap|cap%1:06:00:: and balanced|balance%2:35:00:: the point|point%1:25:00:: on the end|end%1:15:00:: of her nose, while she counted|count%2:32:00:: 
"one, two, three" in a solemn|solemn%3:00:00:serious:00 voice. At once|once%4:02:02:: the cap|cap%1:06:00:: changed|change%2:30:00:: to a 
slate, on which was|be%2:42:05:: written|write%2:36:01:: in big, white|white%3:00:01:: chalk|chalk%1:06:00:: marks: 
 
"LET DOROTHY GO|go%1:06:00:: TO THE CITY|city%1:15:00:: OF EMERALDS." 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: the slate|slate%1:06:00:: from her nose, and, having|have%2:40:00:: read|read%2:31:00:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: on it, asked, 
 
"Is your name|name%1:10:00:: Dorothy, my dear?" 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child, looking|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:01:: her tears. 
 
"Then you must go|go%2:38:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: this City?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:05:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the center|center%1:15:01:: of the country, and is|be%2:42:05:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by Oz, the 
Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: I told|tell%2:32:01:: you of." 
 
"Is he a good|good%3:00:01:: man?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"He is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Wizard. Whether he is|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: or not|not%4:02:00:: I cannot tell, for I 
have|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: there?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"You must walk. It is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, through a country|country%1:15:02:: that is|be%2:42:03:: 
sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: dark|dark%3:00:00:evil:00 and terrible. However, I will 
use|use%2:34:01:: all the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: I know|know%2:31:03:: of to keep|keep%2:41:01:: you from harm." 
 
"Won't you go|go%2:38:00:: with me?" pleaded|plead%2:32:00:: the girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon 
the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: as her only|only%3:00:00:single:05 friend. 
 
"No, I cannot do|do%2:36:01:: that," she replied; "but I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my kiss, 
and no one will|will%1:09:01:: dare injure|injure%2:29:00:: a person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: by the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
of the North." 
 
She came|come%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy and kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:01:: on the forehead. 
Where her lips|lip%1:08:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:02:: they left|leave%2:42:00:: a round, shining|shin%2:38:00:: mark, as 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:02:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds|emerald%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Witch; "so you cannot miss|miss%2:39:00:: it. When you get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of 
him, but tell|tell%2:32:01:: your story|story%1:10:03:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to help|help%2:41:00:: you. Good-bye, my dear." 
 
 
 
The three Munchkins bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to her and wished|wish%2:32:00:: her a pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: 
journey, after which they walked|walk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: through the trees. The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
gave|give%2:40:07:: Dorothy a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: nod, whirled|whirl%2:38:04:: around|around%4:02:09:: on her left|leave%2:38:01:: heel|heel%1:06:02:: 
three times, and straightway disappeared, much|much%3:00:00:: to the surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: of 
little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, who barked|bark%2:32:01:: after her loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: gone, 
because he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: to growl|growl%2:32:00:: while she stood|stand%2:35:00:: by. 
 
But Dorothy, knowing|know%2:31:01:: her to be|be%2:42:06:: a witch, had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: her to disappear|disappear%2:30:00:: 
in just|just%4:02:05:: that way, and was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: in the least. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: III. 
 
 
When Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:30:02:: alone|alone%4:02:01:: she began|begin%2:30:00:: to feel|feel%2:29:00:: hungry. So she went|go%2:38:00:: 
to the cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: herself some bread, which she spread|spread%2:42:00:: with 
butter. She gave|give%2:40:00:: some to Toto, and taking|take%2:35:00:: a pail|pail%1:06:00:: from the shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: 
she carried|carry%2:35:02:: it down|down%4:02:00:: to the little|little%3:00:01:: brook|brook%1:17:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with clear, 
sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:: water. Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark|bark%2:32:00:: at the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: there. Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him, and saw|saw%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 
fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: hanging|hanging%1:04:01:: from the branches|branch%1:20:00:: that she gathered|gather%2:35:00:: some of it, finding|finding%1:04:00:: 
it just|just%4:02:00:: what she wanted|want%2:37:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: her breakfast. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the house, and having|have%2:41:00:: helped|help%2:34:00:: herself and Toto 
to a good|good%3:00:01:: drink|drink%1:04:01:: of the cool, clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, she set|set%2:30:01:: about making|make%2:30:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: 
for the journey|journey%1:04:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. 
 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one other|other%3:00:00:: dress, but that happened|happen%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: and 
was|be%2:42:03:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: on a peg|peg%2:35:00:: beside her bed. It was|be%2:42:03:: gingham, with checks|check%1:21:00:: 
of white|white%3:00:01:: and blue; and although the blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: somewhat|somewhat%4:02:01:: faded|fade%2:30:01:: with 
many|many%3:00:00:: washings, it was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frock. The girl|girl%1:18:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: herself 
carefully, dressed|dress%2:29:00:: herself in the clean|clean%3:00:01:: gingham, and tied|tie%2:35:00:: her pink|pink%1:07:00:: 
sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: on her head. She took|take%2:40:05:: a little|little%3:00:01:: basket|basket%1:06:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with 
bread|bread%1:13:00:: from the cupboard, laying|lay%2:35:01:: a white|white%3:00:01:: cloth|cloth%1:06:00:: over the top. Then|then%4:02:00:: she 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at her feet|foot%1:08:01:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: how old|old%3:00:02:: and worn|wear%2:30:00:: her shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: were. 
 
"They surely|surely%4:02:00:: will never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, Toto," she said. And 
Toto looked|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: with his little|little%3:00:01:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and wagged|wag%2:38:00:: 
his tail|tail%1:05:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: he knew|know%2:31:03:: what she meant. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: on the table|table%1:06:01:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that 
had|have%2:42:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East. 
 
"I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if they will fit|fit%2:30:01:: me," she said|say%2:32:00:: to Toto. "They would be|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:01:: 
the thing|thing%1:26:00:: to take|take%2:39:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: in, for they could not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:03:: out." 
 
She took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her old|old%3:00:01:: leather|leather%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and tried|try%2:29:00:: on the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 ones, 
which fitted|fit%2:42:05:: her as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as if they had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for her. 
 
Finally|finally%4:02:02:: she picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket. 
 
"Come along, Toto," she said, "we will go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz how to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again." 
 
She closed|close%2:35:00:: the door, locked|lock%2:35:00:: it, and put|put%2:35:00:: the key|key%1:06:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in the 
pocket|pocket%1:06:00:: of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting|trot%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: soberly|soberly%4:02:00:: behind 
her, she started|start%2:30:01:: on her journey. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 roads|road%1:06:00:: near by, but it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:40:06:: her long|long%3:00:02:: to 
find|find%2:40:01:: the one|one%1:23:00:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. Within a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: she was|be%2:42:03:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: briskly|briskly%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald City, her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: tinkling|tinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on the hard, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 roadbed. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: and the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 and Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:37:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: as you might 
think|think%2:31:01:: a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: would who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: whisked|whisk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from her 
own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 country|country%1:15:00:: and set|set%2:36:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: surprised, as she walked|walk%2:38:00:: along, to see|see%2:39:00:: how pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: about her. There were|be%2:42:04:: neat|neat%3:00:00:tidy:00 fences|fence%1:06:00:: at the sides|side%1:15:02:: of the road, 
painted|paint%2:35:00:: a dainty|dainty%3:00:00:delicate:00 blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color, and beyond them were|be%2:42:04:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of grain|grain%1:20:00:: and 
vegetables|vegetable%1:20:00:: in abundance. Evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: the Munchkins were|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: farmers|farmer%1:18:00:: 
and able|able%3:00:00:: to raise|raise%2:36:03:: large|large%3:00:00:: crops. Once|once%4:02:00:: in a while|while%1:28:00:: she would pass|pass%2:30:11:: a 
house, and the people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to look|look%2:39:00:: at her and bow|bow%2:38:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: as she 
went|go%2:38:00:: by; for everyone knew|know%2:31:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: the means|mean%1:09:00:: of destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch|witch%1:18:01:: and setting|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage. The houses|house%1:06:00:: of the 
Munchkins were|be%2:42:06:: odd|odd%3:00:00:strange:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: dwellings, for each was|be%2:42:03:: round, with a big|big%3:00:01:: 
dome|dome%1:06:00:: for a roof. All were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: blue, for in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the 
East|east%3:00:00:: blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:popular:00 color. 
 
Towards evening, when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: with her long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: 
to wonder|wonder%2:32:01:: where she should pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night, she came|come%2:38:04:: to a house|house%1:06:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: 
larger|large%3:00:00:: than the rest. On the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lawn|lawn%1:15:00:: before it many|many%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: and women|woman%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dancing. Five little|little%3:00:01:: fiddlers|fiddler%1:18:00:: played|play%2:36:12:: as|as%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: as possible|possible%3:00:00:: and 
the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: laughing|laughing%3:00:00:happy:00 and singing, while a big|big%3:00:01:: table|table%1:06:01:: near by was|be%2:42:03:: 
loaded|load%2:35:01:: with delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits|fruit%1:20:00:: and nuts, pies|pie%1:13:00:: and cakes, and many|many%3:00:00:: other|other%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat. 
 
The people|people%1:14:00:: greeted|greet%2:32:00:: Dorothy kindly, and invited|invite%2:41:00:: her to supper|supper%1:13:00:: and to 
pass|pass%2:41:11:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with them; for this was|be%2:42:06:: the home|home%1:15:04:: of one of the richest|rich%3:00:00:: 
Munchkins in the land, and his friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gathered|gather%2:41:00:: with him to 
celebrate|celebrate%2:41:00:: their freedom|freedom%1:26:00:: from the bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witch. 
 
Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:00:wholesome:00 supper|supper%1:13:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: waited|wait%2:31:00:: upon by the rich|rich%3:00:00:: Munchkin 
himself, whose name|name%1:10:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: Boq. Then|then%4:02:00:: she sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon a settee|settee%1:06:00:: and 
watched|watch%2:39:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: dance. 
 
When Boq saw|saw%2:35:00:: her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he said, 
 
"You must be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 sorceress." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Because you wear|wear%2:29:00:: silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch. 
Besides, you have|have%2:40:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: in your frock, and only|only%3:00:00:single:05 witches|witch%1:18:03:: and 
sorceresses|sorceress%1:18:00:: wear|wear%2:29:00:: white." 
 
 
 
"My dress|dress%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: checked," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, smoothing|smooth%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the 
wrinkles|wrinkle%1:25:00:: in it. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to wear|wear%2:29:00:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Boq. "Blue is|be%2:42:06:: the color|color%1:07:00:: of 
the Munchkins, and white|white%3:00:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the witch|witch%1:18:01:: color; so we know|know%2:31:02:: you are|be%2:42:06:: a 
friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: witch." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: what to say|say%2:32:00:: to this, for all the people|people%1:14:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
to think|think%2:31:01:: her a witch, and she knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: an ordinary|ordinary%3:00:02:common:01 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: by the chance|chance%1:19:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: into a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
When she had|have%2:39:06:: tired|tire%2:29:00:: watching|watch%2:39:05:: the dancing, Boq led|lead%2:38:01:: her into the house, 
where he gave|give%2:40:00:: her a room|room%1:06:00:: with a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 bed|bed%1:06:00:: in it. The sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
made|make%2:42:05:: of blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cloth, and Dorothy slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: in them till morning, 
with Toto curled|curl%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: on the blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rug|rug%1:06:00:: beside her. 
 
She ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 breakfast, and watched|watch%2:39:05:: a wee Munchkin baby, who 
played|play%2:41:03:: with Toto and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: and crowed|crow%2:32:02:: and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: in a way|way%1:07:01:: 
that greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: amused|amuse%2:41:00:: Dorothy. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 curiosity|curiosity%1:09:00:: to all the 
people, for they had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:38:00:: a dog|dog%1:05:00:: before. 
 
"How far|far%4:02:04:: is|be%2:42:03:: it to the Emerald City?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked. 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Boq, gravely, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there. 
It is|be%2:42:03:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 for people|people%1:14:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Oz, unless they have|have%2:40:00:: 
business|business%1:04:00:: with him. But it is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: way|way%1:06:00:: to the Emerald City, and it 
will take|take%2:40:06:: you many|many%3:00:00:: days. The country|country%1:15:01:: here|here%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and pleasant, but 
you must pass|pass%2:38:00:: through rough|rough%3:00:00:: and dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: places|place%1:15:00:: before you reach|reach%2:38:00:: the 
end|end%1:11:00:: of your journey." 
 
This worried|worried%3:00:00:troubled:00 Dorothy a little, but she knew|know%2:31:02:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz 
could help|help%2:41:00:: her get|get%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again, so she bravely|bravely%4:02:00:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
turn|turn%2:38:00:: back. 
 
She bade|bid%2:32:01:: her friends|friend%1:18:00:: good-bye, and again|again%4:02:00:: started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: of 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. When she had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 miles|mile%1:23:01:: she thought|think%2:31:03:: she would 
stop|stop%2:38:00:: to rest, and so|so%4:02:05:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the fence|fence%1:06:00:: beside the road|road%1:06:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down. There was|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: beyond the fence, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
far|far%4:02:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: a Scarecrow, placed|place%2:35:00:: high|high%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: the birds|bird%1:05:00:: 
from the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: corn. 
 
Dorothy leaned|lean%2:38:00:: her chin|chin%1:08:00:: upon her hand|hand%1:08:00:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow. Its head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a small|small%3:00:00:: sack|sack%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, with eyes, 
nose|nose%1:06:01:: and mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: on it to represent|represent%2:32:02:: a face. An old, pointed|point%2:32:00:: 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hat, that had|have%2:40:00:: belonged|belong%2:42:06:: to some Munchkin, was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: on this 
head, and the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the figure|figure%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 suit|suit%1:06:00:: of clothes, worn|wear%2:30:00:: and 
faded, which had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. On the feet|foot%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:04:: some 
old|old%3:00:01:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tops, such|such%3:00:00:much:00 as every man|man%1:18:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: in this country, and 
the figure|figure%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: above the stalks|stalk%1:20:00:: of corn|corn%1:20:00:: by means|mean%1:09:00:: of the pole|pole%1:06:00:: 
stuck|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: its back. 
 
 
 
While Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: looking|look%2:39:00:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: into the queer, painted|paint%2:35:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: of 
the Scarecrow, she was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: one of the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: wink|wink%2:39:00:: 
at her. She thought|think%2:31:03:: she must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: mistaken, at first, for none|none%1:04:00:: of 
the scarecrows|scarecrow%1:06:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: wink; but presently|presently%4:02:00:: the figure|figure%1:08:00:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: its 
head|head%1:08:00:: to her in a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: way. Then|then%4:02:00:: she climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from the fence|fence%1:06:00:: and 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to it, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around the pole|pole%1:06:00:: and barked. 
 
"Good day," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a rather|rather%4:02:04:: husky|husky%3:00:00:robust:00 voice. 
 
"Did you speak?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, in wonder. 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you do?" 
 
"I'm pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 well, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, politely; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you 
do?" 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: feeling|feel%2:29:00:: well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: tedious|tedious%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 being|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day|day%1:28:02:: to scare|scare%2:37:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: crows." 
 
"Can't you get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No, for this pole|pole%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: up|up%4:02:00:: my back. If you will please|please%2:37:01:: take|take%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: 
the pole|pole%1:06:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to you." 
 
Dorothy reached|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: both arms|arm%1:08:00:: and lifted|lift%2:38:00:: the figure|figure%1:25:00:: off the pole; for, 
being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: light. 
 
"Thank you very|very%4:02:01:: much," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: set|set%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the ground. "I feel|feel%2:29:00:: like a new|new%3:00:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: at this, for it sounded|sound%2:39:06:: queer|queer%1:18:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: 
man|man%1:18:00:: speak, and to see|see%2:39:00:: him bow|bow%2:38:00:: and walk|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside her. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: himself and 
yawned, "and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" 
 
"My name|name%1:10:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: 
City, to ask|ask%2:32:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: the Emerald City?" he enquired; "and who is|be%2:42:06:: Oz?" 
 
"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise. 
 
"No, indeed; I|i%1:27:00:: don't know|know%2:31:01:: anything. You see, I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, so I have|have%2:40:00:: 
no brains|brain%1:09:00:: at all," he answered, sadly. 
 
 
 
"Oh," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "I'm awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: for you." 
 
"Do you think," he asked, "If I go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City|city%1:15:00:: with you, that 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz would give|give%2:40:03:: me some brains?" 
 
"I cannot tell," she returned; "but you may come|come%2:38:00:: with me, if you 
like. If Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you any brains|brain%1:09:00:: you will be|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off 
than you are|be%2:42:06:: now." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued, 
confidentially, "I don't mind|mind%2:32:00:: my legs|leg%1:08:01:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and body|body%1:08:01:: being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, 
because I cannot get|get%2:30:00:: hurt. If anyone treads|tread%2:38:01:: on my toes|toe%1:08:01:: or sticks|stick%2:35:01:: a 
pin|pin%1:06:06:: into me, it doesn't matter, for I|i%1:27:00:: cant|cant%1:10:01:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it. But I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: to call|call%2:32:00:: me a fool, and if my head|head%1:08:00:: stays|stay%1:04:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw|straw%1:27:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:00:: of with brains, as yours is, how am|be%2:42:03:: I ever|ever%4:02:04:: to know|know%2:31:01:: anything?" 
 
"I understand|understand%2:31:00:: how you feel," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: 
sorry for him. "If you will come|come%2:38:00:: with me I'll ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to do|do%2:41:01:: all he can 
for you." 
 
"Thank you," he answered, gratefully. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, Dorothy helped|help%2:41:00:: him over the fence, and 
they started|start%2:38:02:: along the path|path%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
Toto did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: this addition|addition%1:06:00:: to the party, at first. He smelled|smell%2:39:03:: 
around the stuffed|stuff%2:30:02:: man|man%1:18:00:: as if he suspected|suspect%2:32:00:: there might be|be%2:42:00:: a nest|nest%1:17:00:: of 
rats|rat%1:05:00:: in the straw, and he often|often%4:02:00:: growled|growl%2:32:00:: in an unfriendly|unfriendly%3:00:01:: way|way%1:07:01:: at the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"Don't mind|mind%1:09:00:: Toto," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, to her new|new%3:00:00:: friend; "he never|never%4:02:00:: bites." 
 
"Oh, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: afraid," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "he can't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
straw. Do|do%1:10:01:: let|let%2:41:00:: me carry|carry%2:35:02:: that basket|basket%1:06:00:: for you. I shall not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: it, 
for I can't get|get%2:30:00:: tired. I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you a secret," he continued, as he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along; "there is|be%2:42:04:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:06:01:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "the Munchkin farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: who made|make%2:36:01:: you?" 
 
"No," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted|light%2:43:00:: match." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IV. 
 
 
After a few|few%3:00:00:: hours|hour%1:28:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: rough, and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
difficult|difficult%3:00:00:: that the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: often|often%4:02:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: over the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: here|here%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: or 
missing|miss%2:42:00:: altogether, leaving|leave%2:42:00:: holes|hole%1:17:01:: that Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: across and Dorothy 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: around. As for the Scarecrow, having|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%3:00:01:: ahead, and so|so%4:02:05:: stepped|step%2:38:00:: into the holes|hole%1:06:00:: and fell|fall%2:38:03:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length|length%1:07:00:: 
on the hard|hard%3:00:01:: bricks. It never|never%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: him, however, and Dorothy would 
pick|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet|foot%1:08:01:: again, while he joined|join%2:41:00:: her in 
laughing|laugh%2:29:00:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: at his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mishap. 
 
 
 
The farms|farm%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: cared|care%2:41:13:: for here|here%4:02:00:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: farther|far%4:02:00:: 
back. There were|be%2:42:00:: fewer|few%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees, and the farther|far%4:02:00:: 
they went|go%2:38:01:: the more|more%4:02:00:: dismal|dismal%3:00:00:depressing:00 and lonesome|lonesome%3:00:00:dejected:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: became. 
 
At noon|noon%1:28:00:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the roadside, near a little|little%3:00:01:: brook, and 
Dorothy opened|open%2:35:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and got|get%2:35:03:: out|out%4:02:04:: some bread. She offered|offer%2:40:00:: a piece|piece%1:21:00:: 
to the Scarecrow, but he refused. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: hungry," he said; "and it is|be%2:42:03:: a lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: not. For 
my mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: painted, and if I should cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:06:00:: in it so I could 
eat, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with would come|come%2:38:00:: out, and that would spoil|spoil%2:30:01:: 
the shape|shape%1:07:00:: of my head." 
 
Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: that this was|be%2:42:03:: true, so she only|only%4:02:02:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: and went|go%2:38:01:: 
on eating|eat%2:34:00:: her bread. 
 
"Tell me something about yourself, and the country|country%1:15:00:: you came|come%2:42:09:: from," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: her dinner. So she told|tell%2:32:01:: 
him all about Kansas, and how gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 everything was|be%2:42:03:: there, and how 
the cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: her to this queer|queer%1:18:00:: land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
listened|listen%2:39:00:: carefully, and said, 
 
"I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: why you should wish|wish%2:37:02:: to leave|leave%2:31:05:: this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
country|country%1:15:01:: and go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 place|place%1:15:00:: you call|call%2:32:02:: Kansas." 
 
 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: because you have|have%2:40:00:: no brains," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. "No matter|matter%1:09:00:: 
how dreary|dreary%3:00:00:dull:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 our homes|home%1:06:00:: are, we people|people%1:14:00:: of flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: and blood|blood%1:08:00:: 
would rather|rather%4:02:01:: live|live%2:42:08:: there|there%4:02:00:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: country, be|be%2:42:03:: it ever|ever%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
beautiful. There is|be%2:42:00:: no place|place%1:15:00:: like home." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sighed. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: it," he said. "If your heads|head%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: with straw, like mine, you would probably|probably%4:02:00:: all live|live%2:42:08:: in the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: places, and then|then%4:02:00:: Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: would have|have%2:40:00:: no people|people%1:14:00:: at all. It is|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: for Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: brains." 
 
"Won't you tell|tell%2:32:01:: me a story, while we are|be%2:42:03:: resting?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her reproachfully, and answered, 
 
"My life|life%1:26:02:: has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: short|short%3:00:02:: that I really|really%4:02:04:: know|know%2:31:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: whatever. I was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: made|make%2:36:08:: day|day%1:28:00:: before yesterday. What happened|happen%2:30:00:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: before 
that time|time%1:28:05:: is|be%2:42:03:: all|all%4:02:00:: unknown|unknown%3:00:00:: to me. Luckily, when the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: my 
head, one of the first|first%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:04:00:: he did|do%2:41:01:: was|be%2:42:06:: to paint|paint%2:35:00:: my ears, so that I 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: what was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: on. There was|be%2:42:04:: another Munchkin with him, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: I heard|hear%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: saying, 
 
"'How do|do%2:41:01:: you like|like%2:37:05:: those ears?' 
 
"'They aren't straight,' answered|answer%2:32:00:: the other. 
 
"'Never mind,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'they are|be%2:42:06:: ears|ear%1:08:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same,' which 
was|be%2:42:03:: true|true%3:00:00:: enough. 
 
"'Now I'll make|make%2:36:00:: the eyes,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer. So he painted|paint%2:35:00:: my right|right%1:15:00:: 
eye, and as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: I found|find%2:39:02:: myself looking|look%2:39:00:: at him and 
at everything around me with a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of curiosity, for this was|be%2:42:06:: 
my first|first%3:00:00:: glimpse|glimpse%1:04:00:: of the world. 
 
"'That's a rather|rather%4:02:04:: pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 eye,' remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Munchkin who was|be%2:42:06:: watching|watch%2:41:00:: 
the farmer; 'blue paint|paint%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:00:: the color|color%1:07:00:: for eyes.' 
 
"'I think|think%1:09:00:: I'll make|make%2:30:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: bigger,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; and 
when the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 eye|eye%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: done|do%2:41:01:: I could see|see%2:39:00:: much|much%4:02:00:: better|better%3:00:02:: than before. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: my nose|nose%1:08:00:: and my mouth; but I did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: speak, because 
at that time|time%1:28:00:: I didn't know|know%2:31:03:: what a mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: for. I had|have%2:40:00:: the fun|fun%1:04:00:: of 
watching|watch%2:39:00:: them make|make%2:36:11:: my body|body%1:08:00:: and my arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs; and when they 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: on my head, at last, I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud, for I thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: 
just|just%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as anyone. 
 
"'This fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: will scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows|crow%1:05:00:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: enough,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: like a man.' 
 
"'Why, he is|be%2:42:03:: a man,' said|say%2:32:00:: the other, and I quite|quite%4:02:01:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. The 
farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: me under his arm|arm%1:08:00:: to the cornfield, and set|set%2:35:00:: me up|up%4:02:00:: on a 
tall|tall%3:00:00:: stick, where you found|find%2:40:00:: me. He and his friend|friend%1:18:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after|after%4:02:01:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
away|away%4:02:03:: and left|leave%2:30:02:: me alone. 
 
"I did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: deserted|desert%2:31:00:: this way; so I tried|try%2:41:00:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: after 
them, but my feet|foot%1:08:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the ground, and I was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:36:00:: to 
stay|stay%2:30:00:: on that pole. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 life|life%1:26:01:: to lead, for I had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to 
think|think%2:36:00:: of, having|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:00:: made|make%2:36:08:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: while before. Many|many%3:00:00:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the cornfield, but as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they saw|saw%2:35:00:: me they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again, thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: I was|be%2:42:06:: a Munchkin; and this pleased|please%2:37:00:: me and 
made|make%2:30:00:: me feel|feel%2:31:01:: that I was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: an important|important%3:00:00:: person. By and by an old|old%3:00:02:: 
crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: near me, and after looking|look%2:39:00:: at me carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: he perched|perch%2:38:00:: upon 
my shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
 
 
"'I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if that farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: thought|think%2:31:06:: to fool|fool%2:41:00:: me in this clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 manner. 
Any crow|crow%1:05:00:: of sense|sense%1:09:04:: could see|see%2:31:01:: that you are|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw.' 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he hopped|hop%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at my feet|foot%1:08:01:: and ate|eat%2:34:00:: all the corn|corn%1:20:00:: he wanted. The 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds, seeing|see%2:31:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: harmed|harm%2:29:00:: by me, came|come%2:38:04:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: the corn|corn%1:20:00:: 
too, so|so%4:02:05:: in a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of them about me." 
 
"I felt|feel%2:37:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: at this, for it showed|show%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a good|good%3:00:01:: Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
after all; but the old|old%3:00:02:: crow|crow%1:05:00:: comforted|comfort%2:37:01:: me, saying: 'If you only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head|head%1:08:00:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any of them, and a 
better|better%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: than some of them. Brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 things|thing%1:09:00:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 having|have%2:40:00:: 
in this world, no matter|matter%1:09:01:: whether one is|be%2:42:06:: a crow|crow%1:05:00:: or a man.' 
 
"After the crows|crow%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:01:: I thought|think%2:31:00:: this over, and decided|decide%2:31:00:: I would 
try|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: some brains. By good|good%3:00:01:: luck, you came|come%2:38:04:: along|along%4:02:00:: and pulled|pull%2:41:00:: 
me off the stake, and from what you say|say%2:32:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%4:02:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz will 
give|give%2:40:00:: me brains|brain%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as we get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"I hope|hope%1:12:01:: so," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly, "since you seem|seem%2:39:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to have|have%2:40:00:: 
them." 
 
"Oh yes; I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "It is|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an 
uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: feeling|feeling%1:26:00:: to know|know%2:31:02:: one is|be%2:42:03:: a fool." 
 
 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "let us go." And she handed|hand%2:40:00:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: to the 
Scarecrow. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: no fences|fence%1:06:00:: at all by the road|road%1:06:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: now, and the land|land%1:21:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
rough|rough%3:00:00:: and untilled. Towards evening|evening%1:28:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and close|close%3:00:05:: together|together%4:02:02:: that their branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: over the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. It was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: dark|dark%3:00:01:: under the 
trees, for the branches|branch%1:20:00:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the daylight; but the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: stop, and went|go%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: into the forest. 
 
"If this road|road%1:06:00:: goes|go%2:42:00:: in, it must come|come%2:38:00:: out," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and as 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: at the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: of the road, we must go|go%2:38:00:: wherever 
it leads|lead%2:38:01:: us." 
 
"Anyone would know|know%2:31:01:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Certainly; that is|be%2:42:06:: why I know|know%2:31:00:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "If it 
required|require%2:42:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: to figure|figure%2:31:02:: it out, I never|never%4:02:00:: should have|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: it." 
 
After an hour|hour%1:28:00:: or so|so%4:02:05:: the light|light%1:19:00:: faded|fade%2:30:02:: away, and they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
stumbling|stumble%2:38:01:: along|along%4:02:01:: in the darkness. Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: at all, 
but Toto could, for some dogs|dog%1:05:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: in the dark; and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he could see|see%2:39:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as by day. So she took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his arm, and managed|manage%2:41:08:: to get|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: fairly|fairly%4:02:02:: well. 
 
"If you see|see%2:39:00:: any house, or any place|place%1:15:00:: where we can pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night," she 
said, "you must tell|tell%2:32:04:: me; for it is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: walking|walking%1:04:00:: in the 
dark." 
 
Soon|soon%4:02:00:: after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stopped. 
 
"I see|see%2:39:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: at the right|right%1:15:00:: of us," he said, "built of logs|log%1:27:01:: 
and branches. Shall we go|go%2:38:00:: there?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child. "I am|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tired%3:00:00:: out." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: her through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
cottage, and Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in one 
corner. She lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at once, and with Toto beside her soon|soon%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
into a sound|sound%3:00:00:reasonable:00 sleep. The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: tired, stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in 
another corner|corner%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: until morning|morning%1:28:00:: came. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: V. 
 
 
When Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: shining|shin%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and Toto 
had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: out|out%4:02:04:: chasing birds|bird%1:05:00:: and squirrels. She sat|sit%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:01:: 
around her. There was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, still|still%4:02:01:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: in his 
corner, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for her. 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: and search|search%2:35:00:: for water," she said|say%2:32:00:: to him. 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you want|want%2:37:00:: water?" he asked. 
 
"To wash|wash%2:29:00:: my face|face%1:08:00:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: after the dust|dust%1:27:00:: of the road, and to drink, so|so%4:02:09:: 
the dry|dry%3:00:01:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: will not|not%4:02:00:: stick|stick%2:38:00:: in my throat." 
 
"It must be|be%2:42:03:: inconvenient|inconvenient%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, 
thoughtfully; "for you must sleep, and eat|eat%2:34:00:: and drink. However, you 
have|have%2:40:00:: brains, and it is|be%2:42:03:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of bother|bother%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: 
properly." 
 
They left|leave%2:38:01:: the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they found|find%2:40:00:: a 
little|little%3:00:01:: spring|spring%1:17:00:: of clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, where Dorothy drank|drink%2:34:00:: and bathed|bath%2:29:00:: and ate|eat%2:34:01:: 
her breakfast. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: left|leave%2:42:03:: in the basket, 
and the girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: thankful|thankful%3:00:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: anything, 
for there was|be%2:42:00:: scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: for herself and Toto for the day. 
 
When she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:34:00:: her meal, and was|be%2:42:03:: about to go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, she was|be%2:42:03:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 groan|groan%1:10:00:: near by. 
 
"What was|be%2:42:06:: that?" she asked, timidly. 
 
"I cannot imagine," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but we can go|go%2:38:00:: and see." 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: then|then%4:02:00:: another groan|groan%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: their ears, and the sound|sound%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to 
come|come%2:38:00:: from behind them. They turned|turn%2:38:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a 
few|few%3:00:00:: steps, when Dorothy discovered|discover%2:39:03:: something shining|shin%2:38:00:: in a ray|ray%1:19:00:: of 
sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: that fell|fall%2:38:00:: between the trees. She ran|run%2:38:00:: to the place, and then|then%4:02:00:: 
stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, with a cry|cry%1:10:04:: of surprise. 
 
One of the big|big%3:00:01:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: partly|partly%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: through, and standing|standing%1:04:00:: 
beside it, with an uplifted|uplifted%3:00:00:elated:00 axe|axe%1:06:00:: in his hands, was|be%2:42:04:: a man|man%1:18:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: 
of tin. His head|head%1:08:00:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: jointed|joint%2:35:00:: upon his body, but he 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: motionless, as if he could not|not%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: at all. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in amazement, and so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: the Scarecrow, while 
Toto barked|bark%2:32:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: and made|make%2:41:00:: a snap|snap%1:04:00:: at the tin|tin%1:27:00:: legs, which hurt|hurt%2:39:00:: his 
teeth. 
 
"Did you groan?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the tin|tin%1:27:00:: man; "I did. I've been|be%2:42:03:: groaning|groan%2:32:00:: for more|more%3:00:01:: than 
a year, and no one|one%1:23:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: me before or come|come%2:38:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for you?" she enquired, softly, for she was|be%2:42:03:: moved|move%2:37:00:: by 
the sad|sad%3:00:00:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: in which the man|man%1:18:00:: spoke. 
 
 
 
"Get an oil-can and oil|oil%1:27:00:: my joints," he answered. "They are|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
badly|badly%4:02:02:: that I cannot move|move%2:38:01:: them at all; if I am|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: oiled|oil%2:35:00:: I shall soon|soon%4:02:00:: 
be|be%2:42:03:: all right|right%3:00:02:: again. You will find|find%2:40:02:: an oil-can on a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: in my cottage." 
 
Dorothy at once|once%4:02:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: the oil-can, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: she returned|return%2:38:00:: and asked, anxiously, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: your joints?" 
 
"Oil my neck, first," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. So she oiled|oil%2:35:00:: it, and 
as it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of the tin|tin%1:27:00:: head|head%1:06:00:: 
and moved|move%2:38:01:: it gently|gently%4:02:01:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: until it worked|work%2:35:02:: freely, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: could turn|turn%2:38:00:: it himself. 
 
"Now oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled|oil%2:35:00:: them and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: them carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: free|free%3:00:00:: from 
rust|rust%1:27:00:: and as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as new. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: gave|give%2:40:03:: a sigh|sigh%1:10:00:: of satisfaction|satisfaction%1:12:00:: and lowered|lower%2:38:00:: his axe, 
which he leaned|lean%2:35:00:: against the tree. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 comfort," he said. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:00:: that axe in 
the air|air%1:27:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: since I rusted, and I'm glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: it down|down%4:02:00:: 
at last. Now, if you will oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: of my legs, I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all 
right|right%4:02:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: more." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they oiled|oil%2:35:00:: his legs|leg%1:08:01:: until he could move|move%2:38:01:: them freely; and he 
thanked|thank%2:32:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: and again|again%4:02:00:: for his release, for he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
polite|polite%3:00:00:: creature, and very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 grateful. 
 
"I might have|have%2:41:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: there|there%4:02:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: if you had|have%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: along," he said; 
"so you have|have%2:40:00:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How did|do%2:41:01:: you happen|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:05:: here?" 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: on our way|way%1:04:02:: to the Emerald City, to see|see%2:39:02:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz," she 
answered, "and we stopped|stop%2:38:00:: at your cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:41:11:: Oz?" he asked. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: wants|want%2:37:00:: him to 
put|put%2:35:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: into his head," she replied. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: appeared|appear%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: deeply|deeply%4:02:00:: for a moment. Then|then%4:02:00:: he said: 
 
"Do you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart?" 
 
"Why, I guess|guess%1:10:00:: so," Dorothy answered; "it would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: as to give|give%2:40:00:: 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brains." 
 
 
 
"True," the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: returned. "So, if you will allow|allow%2:41:00:: me to join|join%2:41:00:: 
your party, I will also|also%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"Come along," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, heartily; and Dorothy added|add%2:32:01:: 
that she would be|be%2:42:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: his company. So the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
shouldered|shoulder%2:35:02:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to put|put%2:35:00:: the oil-can in her basket. 
"For," he said, "if I should get|get%2:30:00:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the rain, and rust|rust%1:22:00:: again, 
I would need|need%2:34:00:: the oil-can badly." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: their new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: join|join%2:41:00:: the party, 
for soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:01:: their journey|journey%1:04:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a place|place%1:15:00:: 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and branches|branch%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 over the road|road%1:06:00:: that the 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: could not|not%4:02:00:: pass. But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: 
and chopped|chop%2:35:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: that soon|soon%4:02:00:: he cleared|clear%2:30:02:: a passage|passage%1:06:00:: for the entire|entire%3:00:01:whole:00 party. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: as they walked|walk%2:38:00:: along that she did|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: notice|notice%2:39:04:: when the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: into a hole|hole%1:17:01:: and rolled|roll%2:38:01:: over|over%4:02:01:: to 
the side|side%1:15:02:: of the road. Indeed, he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:09:: to her to help|help%2:41:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"Why didn't you walk|walk%2:38:00:: around the hole?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I don't know|know%2:31:01:: enough," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, cheerfully. "My head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: with straw, you know, and that is|be%2:42:06:: why I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
him for some brains." 
 
"Oh, I see;" said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "But, after all, brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
the best|best%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
"Have you any?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"No, my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: empty," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "but once I had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains, and a heart|heart%1:09:00:: also; so, having|have%2:40:00:: tried|try%2:34:00:: them both, I should much|much%4:02:03:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"And why is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will know." 
 
So, while they were|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: 
the following|follow%2:42:05:: story: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: the son|son%1:18:00:: of a woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: who chopped|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: and sold|sell%2:40:00:: the wood|wood%1:27:00:: for a living. When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I too|too%4:02:01:: became|become%2:42:01:: a 
wood-chopper, and after my father|father%1:18:00:: died|die%2:30:00:: I took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:04:02:: of my old|old%3:00:02:: mother|mother%1:18:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she lived. Then|then%4:02:00:: I made|make%2:36:08:: up|up%4:02:00:: my mind|mind%1:09:04:: that instead|instead%4:02:01:: of living|live%2:42:01:: 
alone|alone%4:02:01:: I would marry, so that I might not|not%4:02:00:: become|become%2:30:00:: lonely. 
 
 
 
"There was|be%2:42:04:: one of the Munchkin girls|girl%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: that I 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: to love|love%2:37:00:: her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised|promise%2:32:00:: 
to marry|marry%2:41:00:: me as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as I could earn|earn%2:40:01:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 money|money%1:21:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: a better|better%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: for her; so I set|set%2:30:01:: to work|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever. But the girl|girl%1:18:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: 
with an old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: her to marry|marry%2:41:00:: anyone, for she was|be%2:42:03:: 
so|so%4:02:02:: lazy|lazy%3:00:00:idle:00 she wished|wish%2:37:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: to remain|remain%2:42:03:: with her and do|do%2:41:01:: the cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
and the housework. So the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: to the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and promised|promise%2:32:01:: her two sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: and a cow|cow%1:05:01:: if she would prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: the 
marriage. Thereupon the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: enchanted|enchant%2:37:00:: my axe, and when I was|be%2:42:03:: 
chopping|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:05:: at my best|best%3:00:00:: one day, for I was|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:40:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: and my wife|wife%1:18:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: all at once|once%4:02:02:: 
and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my left|left%3:00:00:: leg. 
 
"This at first|first%4:02:02:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 misfortune, for I knew|know%2:31:00:: a one-legged man|man%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wood-chopper. So I went|go%2:38:00:: to a tin-smith 
and had|have%2:32:00:: him make|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. The leg|leg%1:08:01:: worked|work%2:35:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well, 
once|once%4:02:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to it; but my action|action%1:04:02:: angered|anger%2:37:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the East, for she had|have%2:40:00:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: I should not|not%4:02:00:: marry|marry%2:41:00:: the 
pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: Munchkin girl. When I began|begin%2:30:00:: chopping|chop%2:35:01:: again|again%4:02:00:: my axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: and 
cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my right|right%3:00:00:: leg. Again I went|go%2:38:00:: to the tinner, and again|again%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: 
me a leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. After this the enchanted|enchanted%3:00:00:: axe|axe%1:06:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my arms, 
one after the other; but, nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: daunted, I had|have%2:30:00:: them replaced|replace%2:30:00:: with 
tin|tin%1:27:00:: ones. The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my 
head, and at first|first%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me. But the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: 
happened|happen%2:30:02:: to come|come%2:38:04:: along, and he made|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: head|head%1:08:00:: out of tin. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: beaten|beat%2:33:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then, and I worked|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than 
ever; but I little|little%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:01:: how cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 my enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: could be. She thought|think%2:31:00:: of a 
new|new%3:00:00:: way|way%1:04:01:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: my love|love%1:12:00:: for the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Munchkin maiden, and made|make%2:30:00:: my 
axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: again, so that it cut|cut%2:35:00:: right|right%4:02:09:: through my body, splitting me 
into two halves. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:03:: to my help|help%1:04:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: me a 
body|body%1:08:00:: of tin, fastening|fasten%2:35:00:: my tin|tin%1:27:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: to it, by means|mean%1:09:00:: of 
joints, so that I could move|move%2:38:01:: around|around%4:02:04:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. But, alas! I had|have%2:40:00:: 
now|now%4:02:00:: no heart, so that I lost|lose%2:40:02:: all my love|love%1:12:00:: for the Munchkin girl, and did|do%2:41:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether I married|marry%2:41:00:: her or not. I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: she is|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: living|live%2:42:08:: 
with the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for me to come|come%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
 
 
"My body|body%1:08:00:: shone|shine%2:43:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: in the sun|sun%1:17:00:: that I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of it 
and it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: if my axe slipped, for it could not|not%4:02:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: me. 
There was|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one danger--that my joints|joint%1:08:00:: would rust; but I kept|keep%2:40:01:: an 
oil-can in my cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:09:00:: to oil|oil%1:27:00:: myself whenever I needed|need%2:34:00:: 
it. However, there came|come%2:30:01:: a day|day%1:28:03:: when I forgot|forget%2:31:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: this, and, being|be%2:42:06:: 
caught|catch%2:35:03:: in a rainstorm, before I thought|think%2:31:00:: of the danger|danger%1:26:01:: my joints|joint%1:08:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
rusted, and I was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: in the woods|wood%1:14:00:: until you came|come%2:38:04:: to help|help%2:41:00:: 
me. It was|be%2:42:06:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 thing|thing%1:04:00:: to undergo, but during the year|year%1:28:01:: I stood|stand%2:42:04:: 
there|there%4:02:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: that the greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 loss|loss%1:11:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: known|know%2:31:04:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
the loss|loss%1:21:01:: of my heart. While I was|be%2:42:03:: in love|love%1:12:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: the happiest|happy%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: on 
earth; but no one can|can%1:06:02:: love|love%1:18:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: a heart, and so I am|be%2:42:03:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: 
to ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to give|give%2:40:00:: me one. If he does, I will go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the Munchkin 
maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: and marry|marry%2:41:00:: her." 
 
Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the 
story|story%1:10:03:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and now|now%4:02:05:: they knew|know%2:31:01:: why he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to 
get|get%2:30:01:: a new|new%3:00:00:: heart. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "I shall ask|ask%2:32:01:: for brains|brain%1:08:00:: instead|instead%4:02:00:: 
of a heart; for a fool|fool%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what to do|do%2:41:01:: with a heart|heart%1:09:00:: if he 
had|have%2:40:00:: one." 
 
"I shall take|take%2:35:00:: the heart," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "for brains|brain%1:08:00:: do|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: make|make%2:30:00:: one happy, and happiness|happiness%1:12:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: anything, for she was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: to know|know%2:31:01:: which of 
her two friends|friend%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: right, and she decided|decide%2:31:00:: if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: 
to Kansas|kansa%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: whether the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: no heart, or each got|get%2:40:00:: what he wanted. 
 
 
 
What worried|worry%2:37:01:: her most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: that the bread|bread%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: gone, and another 
meal|meal%1:13:00:: for herself and Toto would empty|empty%2:30:01:: the basket. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 neither 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: nor the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: anything, but she was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: 
of tin|tin%1:27:00:: nor straw, and could not|not%4:02:00:: live|live%2:42:04:: unless she was|be%2:42:03:: fed. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VI. 
 
 
All this time|time%1:28:05:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 woods. The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, but these 
were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: by dried|dry%2:30:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: and dead|dead%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: from the trees, 
and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all good. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: few|few%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: in this part|part%1:24:00:: of the forest, for birds|bird%1:05:00:: love|love%2:37:02:: the 
open|open%3:00:00:unobstructed:00 country|country%1:15:02:: where there is|be%2:42:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of sunshine; but now|now%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:01:: 
there came|come%2:38:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: from some wild|wild%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: hidden|hide%2:39:00:: among the trees. 
These sounds|sound%1:11:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl's heart beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast, for she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know|know%2:31:01:: what made|make%2:36:00:: them; but Toto knew, and he walked|walk%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy's 
side, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: even|even%2:30:01:: bark|bark%1:11:00:: in return. 
 
"How long|long%4:02:00:: will it be," the child|child%1:18:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "before we 
are|be%2:42:03:: out of the forest?" 
 
"I cannot tell," was|be%2:42:06:: the answer, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the 
Emerald City. But my father|father%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: there once, when I was|be%2:42:03:: a boy, and 
he said|say%2:32:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: through a dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: country, although 
nearer to the city|city%1:15:00:: where Oz dwells|dwell%2:42:00:: the country|country%1:15:02:: is|be%2:42:03:: beautiful. But I|i%1:27:00:: 
am not|not%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I have|have%2:40:00:: my oil-can, and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: can hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
Scarecrow, while you bear|bear%2:42:01:: upon your forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the good|good%3:00:02:: 
Witch's kiss, and that will protect|protect%2:33:00:: you from harm." 
 
"But Toto!" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously; "what will protect|protect%2:33:00:: him?" 
 
"We must protect|protect%2:33:00:: him ourselves, if he is|be%2:42:03:: in danger," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman. 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: as he spoke|speak%2:32:00:: there came|come%2:38:00:: from the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 roar, and the 
next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: bounded|bound%2:38:01:: into the road. With one blow|blow%1:04:01:: of his 
paw|paw%2:35:01:: he sent|send%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: spinning|spin%2:38:01:: over and over to the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the 
road, and then|then%4:02:00:: he struck|strike%2:35:00:: at the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: with his sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: claws. 
But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make|make%2:36:00:: no impression|impression%1:09:00:: on the tin, 
although the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: over|over%4:02:01:: in the road|road%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: still. 
 
Little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, now|now%4:02:05:: that he had|have%2:40:00:: an enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: to face, ran|run%2:38:00:: barking|bark%2:32:01:: toward the 
Lion, and the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: his mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: the dog, when 
Dorothy, fearing|fear%2:37:03:: Toto would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, and heedless of danger, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward|forward%4:02:00:: and slapped|slap%2:35:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: upon his nose|nose%1:08:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as she could, 
while she cried|cry%2:32:01:: out: 
 
"Don't you dare|dare%2:41:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: Toto! You ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself, a 
big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: like you, to bite|bite%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: dog!" 
 
"I didn't bite|bite%1:26:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, as he rubbed|rub%2:35:00:: his nose|nose%1:08:00:: with his 
paw|paw%1:08:01:: where Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: hit|hit%2:35:00:: it. 
 
"No, but you tried|try%2:41:00:: to," she retorted. "You are|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a big|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
coward." 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, hanging|hang%2:38:03:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in shame; "I've always|always%4:02:00:: 
known|know%2:31:01:: it. But how can I help|help%2:41:00:: it?" 
 
"I don't know, I'm sure. To think|think%2:31:00:: of your striking|strike%2:35:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: man, 
like the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow!" 
 
"Is he stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, in surprise, as he watched|watch%2:41:00:: her pick|pick%1:14:00:: 
up the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet, while she patted|pat%2:35:01:: him into 
shape|shape%1:08:00:: again. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: he's stuffed," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: angry. 
 
"That's why he went|go%2:38:00:: over so|so%4:02:02:: easily," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. "It astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
me to see|see%2:39:00:: him whirl|whirl%1:04:02:: around so. Is|be%2:42:03:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one stuffed, also?" 
 
"No," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "he's made|make%2:42:05:: of tin." And she helped|help%2:41:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
again. 
 
"That's why he nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: blunted|blunt%2:30:01:: my claws," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "When they 
scratched|scratch%2:35:03:: against the tin|tin%1:06:01:: it made|make%2:32:00:: a cold|cold%1:09:00:: shiver|shiver%2:38:00:: run|run%2:38:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: my back. 
What is|be%2:42:06:: that little|little%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: tender|tender%3:00:00:loving:00 of?" 
 
"He is|be%2:42:06:: my dog, Toto," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Is he made|make%2:42:05:: of tin, or stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Neither. He's a--a--a meat|meat%1:13:01:: dog," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh. He's a curious|curious%3:00:00:: animal, and seems|seem%2:39:00:: remarkably|remarkably%4:02:00:: small, now|now%4:02:05:: that I 
look|look%2:39:00:: at him. No|no%1:10:00:: one would think|think%2:31:00:: of biting|bite%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: except 
a coward|coward%1:18:00:: like me," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the Lion, sadly. 
 
"What makes|make%2:30:00:: you a coward?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, looking|look%2:39:00:: at the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: 
in wonder, for he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as a small|small%3:00:00:: horse. 
 
 
 
"It's a mystery," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: that 
way. All the other|other%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to be|be%2:42:03:: 
brave, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts. 
I learned|learn%2:31:00:: that if I roared|roar%2:32:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: every living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: and got|get%2:30:00:: out of my way. Whenever I've met|meet%2:38:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: I've been|be%2:42:03:: 
awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: scared; but I just|just%4:02:03:: roared|roar%2:32:03:: at him, and he has|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could go. If the elephants|elephant%1:05:00:: and the tigers|tiger%1:05:00:: and the bears|bear%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: tried|try%2:41:00:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: me, I should have|have%2:40:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: myself--I'm such a 
coward; but just|just%4:02:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they hear|hear%2:39:00:: me roar|roar%1:10:00:: they all try|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:35:09:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: from me, and of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them go." 
 
"But that isn't right. The King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts|beast%1:03:00:: shouldn't be|be%2:42:03:: a coward," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:01:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: a tear|tear%2:29:00:: from his eye|eye%1:08:00:: with the 
tip|tip%1:25:00:: of his tail; "it is|be%2:42:06:: my great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow, and makes|make%2:30:00:: my life|life%1:26:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
unhappy. But whenever there is|be%2:42:04:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: my heart|heart%1:08:00:: begins|begin%2:30:00:: to beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast." 
 
"Perhaps you have|have%2:29:02:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"It may be," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"If you have," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: glad, for 
it proves|prove%2:31:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. For my part, I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart; so I cannot 
have|have%2:40:00:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease." 
 
"Perhaps," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully, "if I had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should 
not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Have you brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so. I've never|never%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: to see," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I am going|go%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, "for my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw." 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: Toto and me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," added|add%2:32:01:: 
Dorothy. 
 
"Do you think|think%2:31:03:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion. 
 
"Just as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as he could give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Or give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Or send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go|go%2:38:00:: with you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for my 
life|life%1:26:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: simply|simply%4:02:03:: unbearable|unbearable%3:00:00:: without a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of courage." 
 
"You will be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: welcome," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "for you will help|help%2:41:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts. It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me they must be|be%2:42:06:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: than you are|be%2:42:03:: if they allow|allow%2:32:00:: you to scare|scare%2:37:00:: them so easily." 
 
"They really|really%4:02:03:: are," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "but that doesn't make|make%2:30:00:: me any braver, 
and as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I know|know%2:31:02:: myself to be|be%2:42:03:: a coward|coward%1:18:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: unhappy." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: company|company%1:14:01:: set|set%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the journey, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 strides|stride%1:04:00:: at Dorothy's side. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: approve|approve%2:32:00:: 
this new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: at first, for he could not|not%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: how nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: he 
had|have%2:30:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: crushed|crush%2:35:00:: between the Lion's great|great%3:00:01:large:00 jaws; but after a time|time%1:28:00:: he 
became|become%2:30:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: at ease, and presently|presently%4:02:00:: Toto and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
grown|grow%2:30:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: friends. 
 
During the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of that day|day%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: no other|other%3:00:00:: adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: to mar the 
peace|peace%1:26:02:: of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon a 
beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: crawling|crawl%2:38:00:: along the road, and killed|kill%2:35:00:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: 
thing. This made|make%2:30:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy, for he was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: 
careful|careful%3:00:00:mindful:00 not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: any living|live%2:42:04:: creature; and as he walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he 
wept|weep%2:29:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 tears|tear%1:08:01:: of sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: and regret. These tears|tear%1:08:01:: ran|run%2:38:01:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
his face|face%1:08:00:: and over the hinges|hinge%1:06:00:: of his jaw, and there they rusted. 
When Dorothy presently|presently%4:02:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: him a question|question%1:10:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could 
not|not%4:02:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: his mouth, for his jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: together. He 
became|become%2:30:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at this and made|make%2:41:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: motions|motion%1:04:00:: to Dorothy to 
relieve|relieve%2:40:01:: him, but she could not|not%4:02:00:: understand. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: 
to know|know%2:31:01:: what was|be%2:42:03:: wrong. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the oil-can from 
Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few|few%3:00:00:: 
moments|moment%1:28:01:: he could talk|talk%2:32:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as before. 
 
 
 
"This will serve|serve%2:42:03:: me a lesson," said|say%2:32:00:: he, "to look|look%2:39:00:: where I step. For if 
I should kill|kill%2:35:00:: another bug|bug%1:05:02:: or beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: I should surely|surely%4:02:00:: cry|cry%2:29:00:: again, and 
crying|cry%2:34:00:: rusts|rust%2:30:01:: my jaw|jaw%1:08:00:: so that I cannot speak." 
 
Thereafter|thereafter%4:02:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: carefully, with his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on the road, 
and when he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 ant|ant%1:05:00:: toiling by he would step|step%2:38:01:: over it, so|so%4:02:05:: as 
not|not%4:02:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: it. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and 
therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: he took|take%2:41:04:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 care|care%1:09:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 or unkind|unkind%3:00:00:: to anything. 
 
"You people|people%1:14:00:: with hearts," he said, "have something to guide|guide%2:38:00:: you, 
and need never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: wrong; but I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and so I must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
careful. When Oz gives|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: of course|course%1:14:00:: I needn't mind|mind%1:09:00:: so much."

They were|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to camp|camp%1:06:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: that night|night%1:28:00:: under a large|large%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no houses|house%1:06:00:: near. The tree|tree%1:20:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a good, thick|thick%3:00:01:: 
covering|cover%2:35:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: them from the dew, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood|wood%1:27:00:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and Dorothy built|build%2:36:00:: a splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 fire|fire%1:06:00:: that 
warmed|warm%2:30:01:: her and made|make%2:30:00:: her feel|feel%2:37:00:: less|less%4:02:00:: lonely. She and Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: the last|last%3:00:00:: of 
their bread, and now|now%4:02:05:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what they would do|do%2:41:01:: for breakfast. 
 
"If you wish," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I will go|go%2:38:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and kill|kill%2:35:00:: a 
deer|deer%1:05:00:: for you. You can roast|roast%1:13:00:: it by the fire, since your tastes|taste%1:12:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
peculiar|peculiar%3:00:00:unusual:00 that you prefer|prefer%2:37:00:: cooked|cook%2:36:01:: food, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will have|have%2:34:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: breakfast." 
 
"Don't! please|please%2:37:01:: don't," begged|beg%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "I should certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: 
weep if you killed|kill%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 deer, and then|then%4:02:00:: my jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: would rust|rust%1:22:00:: again." 
 
 
 
But the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 supper, and no 
one|one%1:23:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: knew|know%2:31:01:: what it was, for he didn't mention|mention%1:10:01:: it. And the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
found|find%2:40:02:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: with them, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that she would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: hungry|hungry%3:00:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: time. She thought|think%2:31:03:: this was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
kind|kind%1:09:00:: and thoughtful|thoughtful%3:00:00:considerate:00 of the Scarecrow, but she laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: heartily|heartily%4:02:03:: at the 
awkward|awkward%3:00:00:unwieldy:00 way|way%1:07:01:: in which the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 creature|creature%1:03:00:: picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the nuts. His padded|padded%3:00:00:soft:01 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 and the nuts|nut%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that he dropped|drop%2:38:00:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: as he put|put%2:35:00:: in the basket. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: how 
long|long%4:02:00:: it took|take%2:40:06:: him to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the basket, for it enabled|enable%2:30:00:: him to keep|keep%2:41:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
from the fire, as he feared|fear%2:37:03:: a spark|spark%2:43:00:: might get|get%2:38:12:: into his straw|straw%1:27:01:: and burn|burn%2:30:02:: 
him up. So he kept|keep%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: from the flames, and only|only%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
near to cover|cover%2:35:00:: Dorothy with dry|dry%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: when she lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to sleep. These 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: her very|very%4:02:00:: snug|snug%3:00:00:comfortable:00 and warm|warm%3:00:01:: and she slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until morning. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: daylight|daylight%1:19:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: bathed|bath%2:29:00:: her face|face%1:08:00:: in a little|little%3:00:01:: rippling|ripple%2:38:00:: 
brook|brook%1:17:00:: and soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they all started|start%2:38:02:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
This was|be%2:42:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: an eventful|eventful%3:00:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: for the travellers. They had|have%2:40:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: an hour|hour%1:28:00:: when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: before them a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: that 
crossed|cross%2:38:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: and divided|divide%2:41:00:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see|see%2:39:00:: on 
either side. It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: ditch, and when they crept|creep%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the 
edge|edge%1:15:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: into it they could see|see%2:39:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: deep, and 
there were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: big, jagged|jagged%3:00:00:uneven:00 rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. The sides|side%1:15:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:07:: 
steep|steep%1:17:00:: that none|none%1:28:00:: of them could climb|climb%2:38:00:: down, and for a moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
that their journey|journey%1:04:00:: must end. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, despairingly. 
 
"I haven't the faintest|faint%3:00:02:indistinct:00 idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
shook|shake%2:38:00:: his shaggy mane|mane%1:05:00:: and looked|look%2:29:00:: thoughtful. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said: 
 
"We cannot fly, that is|be%2:42:03:: certain; neither can we climb|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into this 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump|jump%1:11:00:: over it, we must stop|stop%2:38:00:: where 
we are." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:03:: I could jump|jump%2:38:00:: over it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, after 
measuring|measure%2:30:00:: the distance|distance%1:07:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in his mind. 
 
"Then we are|be%2:42:03:: all right," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for you can carry|carry%2:38:07:: 
us all over|over%4:02:05:: on your back, one at a time." 
 
"Well, I'll try|try%1:04:00:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "Who will go|go%2:41:00:: first?" 
 
"I will," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "for, if you found|find%2:31:09:: that you could 
not|not%4:02:00:: jump|jump%2:38:00:: over the gulf, Dorothy would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, or the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
badly|badly%4:02:00:: dented|dent%2:35:00:: on the rocks|rock%1:17:01:: below. But if I am|be%2:42:05:: on your back|back%1:08:00:: it will not|not%4:02:00:: 
matter so|so%4:02:02:: much, for the fall|fall%1:04:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me at all." 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of falling, myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, 
"but I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but try|try%2:41:01:: it. So|so%4:02:05:: get|get%2:30:00:: on my back|back%1:08:00:: 
and we will make|make%2:41:00:: the attempt." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:38:00:: upon the Lion's back, and the big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to 
the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: and crouched|crouch%2:38:00:: down. 
 
"Why don't you run|run%2:38:00:: and jump?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Because that isn't the way|way%1:07:01:: we Lions|lion%1:05:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: these things," he replied. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: giving|give%2:40:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spring, he shot|shoot%2:38:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: and landed|land%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: 
on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. They were|be%2:42:03:: all greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: how easily|easily%4:02:01:: he 
did|do%2:36:01:: it, and after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:41:00:: got|get%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from his back|back%1:08:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
sprang|spring%2:38:01:: across the ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: again. 
 
Dorothy thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:38:00:: next; so she took|take%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
climbed|climb%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back, holding|hold%2:35:00:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: to his mane|mane%1:05:00:: with one 
hand. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: as if she was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: through the air; 
and then, before she had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about it, she was|be%2:42:03:: safe|safe%3:00:01:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: a third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: and got|get%2:40:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
and then|then%4:02:00:: they all sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: for a few|few%3:00:00:: moments|moment%1:28:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: the beast|beast%1:03:00:: a 
chance|chance%1:26:00:: to rest, for his great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 leaps|leap%1:04:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: his breath|breath%1:27:00:: short, and he 
panted|pant%2:32:00:: like a big|big%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: that has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: running|run%2:38:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long. 
 
 
 
They found|find%2:31:10:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 on this side, and it looked|look%2:39:01:: dark|dark%1:28:00:: 
and gloomy. After the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: rested|rest%2:32:00:: they started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, silently wondering, each in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mind, if ever|ever%4:02:04:: 
they would come|come%2:38:04:: to the end|end%1:15:00:: of the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and reach|reach%2:38:01:: the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: 
again. To add|add%2:30:00:: to their discomfort, they soon|soon%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: noises|noise%1:11:00:: in 
the depths|depth%1:07:00:: of the forest, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: to them that it was|be%2:42:06:: 
in this part|part%1:15:00:: of the country|country%1:15:00:: that the Kalidahs lived. 
 
"What are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:03:: monstrous|monstrous%3:00:00:evil:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:00:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like 
tigers," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion; "and with claws|claw%1:05:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%3:00:01:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: that 
they could tear|tear%2:35:00:: me in two as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as I could kill|kill%2:35:00:: Toto. I'm 
terribly|terribly%4:02:01:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of the Kalidahs." 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: that you are," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy "They must be|be%2:42:03:: 
dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 beasts." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to another gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: 
across the road; but this one|one%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: broad|broad%3:00:04:: and deep|deep%3:00:00:thick:01 that the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
knew|know%2:31:01:: at once|once%4:02:00:: he could not|not%4:02:00:: leap|leap%2:38:00:: across it. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: what they should do, and after serious|serious%3:00:00:critical:03 
thought|think%2:31:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 tree, standing|stand%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the ditch. If the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: can chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, so that it will fall|fall%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side, we 
can walk|walk%2:38:00:: across it easily." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: a first|first%3:00:00:best:00 rate|rate%1:24:00:: idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "One would almost|almost%4:02:00:: suspect|suspect%2:32:00:: 
you had|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of straw." 
 
The Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: at once, and so|so%4:02:02:: sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: that the 
tree|tree%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: through. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: put|put%2:35:05:: his strong|strong%3:00:00:: 
front|front%3:00:00:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: against the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and pushed|push%2:38:00:: with all his might, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
the big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: tipped|tip%2:38:01:: and fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:04:00:: across the ditch, with its 
top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. 
 
They had|have%2:40:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: started|start%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: this queer|queer%1:18:00:: bridge|bridge%1:06:00:: when a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: 
made|make%2:32:00:: them all look|look%2:39:00:: up, and to their horror|horror%1:12:01:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: toward 
them two great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:01:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like tigers. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs!" said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble. 
 
"Quick!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, "let us cross|cross%2:38:00:: over." 
 
 
 
So Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: first, holding|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms; the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
followed, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: next. The Lion, although he was|be%2:42:03:: 
certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: afraid, turned|turn%2:38:00:: to face|face%2:32:00:: the Kalidahs, and then|then%4:02:00:: he gave|give%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
loud|loud%3:00:00:: and terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 a roar|roar%1:11:00:: that Dorothy screamed|scream%2:32:01:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
over backwards, while even|even%4:02:00:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%3:00:02:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: 
at him in surprise. 
 
But, seeing|see%2:31:01:: they were|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the Lion, and remembering|remember%2:31:00:: that 
there were|be%2:42:04:: two of them and only|only%4:02:02:: one of him, the Kalidahs again|again%4:02:00:: rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: over the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:31:01:: what 
they would do|do%2:41:01:: next. Without stopping|stop%2:42:00:: an instant|instant%1:28:01:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: 
also|also%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: the tree, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: lost, for they will surely|surely%4:02:00:: tear|tear%2:35:01:: us to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: with their sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
claws. But stand|stand%1:06:03:: close|close%1:28:00:: behind me, and I will fight|fight%2:33:01:: them as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I 
am|be%2:42:03:: alive." 
 
"Wait a minute!" called|call%2:32:09:: the Scarecrow. He had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: what was|be%2:42:06:: 
best|best%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: done, and now|now%4:02:05:: he asked|ask%2:32:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:01:: the end|end%1:15:00:: 
of the tree|tree%1:20:00:: that rested|rest%2:35:00:: on their side|side%1:15:02:: of the ditch. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to use|use%2:34:01:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: at once, and, just|just%4:02:05:: as the two Kalidahs were|be%2:42:03:: 
nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: across, the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: into the gulf, carrying|carry%2:35:02:: the 
ugly, snarling brutes|brute%1:18:00:: with it, and both were|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:35:02:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: on the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, drawing|draw%2:34:01:: a long|long%3:00:02:: breath|breath%1:04:00:: of relief, "I 
see|see%2:31:01:: we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to live|live%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: while longer, and I am|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: of it, 
for it must be|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: alive. Those 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: me so|so%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: that my heart|heart%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: beating|beat%2:38:00:: yet." 
 
"Ah." said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly, "I wish|wish%1:12:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:08:00:: to beat." 
 
 
 
This adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: out of 
the forest, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: that Dorothy became|become%2:30:00:: tired, and had|have%2:40:00:: 
to ride|ride%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back. To their great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy|joy%1:12:00:: the trees|tree%1:20:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: thinner|thin%3:00:01:insignificant:00 
the further|far%4:02:04:: they advanced, and in the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: they suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon 
a broad|broad%3:00:04:: river, flowing|flow%2:38:00:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: before them. On the other|other%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the water|water%1:27:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through a 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country, with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 meadows|meadow%1:15:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: with bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:02:: and 
all the road|road%1:06:00:: bordered|border%2:42:00:: with trees|tree%1:20:00:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits. They 
were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: this delightful|delightful%3:00:00:pleasing:00 country|country%1:15:02:: before them. 
 
"How shall we cross|cross%2:38:00:: the river?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: done," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: must 
build|build%2:36:00:: us a raft, so we can float|float%2:38:01:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: took|take%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: small|small%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
a raft, and while he was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: at this the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: on the river|river%1:17:00:: 
bank|bank%2:40:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fruit. This pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but nuts|nut%1:20:00:: all day, and she made|make%2:30:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 meal|meal%1:13:00:: of the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: fruit. 
 
But it takes|take%2:42:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to make|make%2:36:01:: a raft, even|even%4:02:00:: when one is|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: industrious|industrious%3:00:00:diligent:00 and 
untiring as the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and when night|night%1:28:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: the work|work%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: done. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they found|find%2:40:02:: a cozy|cozy%3:00:00:comfortable:00 place|place%1:15:00:: under the trees|tree%1:20:00:: where they slept|sleep%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: until 
the morning; and Dorothy dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: of the Emerald City, and of the good|good%3:00:01:: 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: Oz, who would soon|soon%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: her back|back%4:02:04:: to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VIII. 
 
 
Our little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: of travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:01:: next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: refreshed|refresh%2:30:00:: and 
full|full%3:00:00:: of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted|breakfast%2:34:00:: like a princess|princess%1:18:00:: off peaches|peach%1:13:00:: and 
plums|plum%1:13:00:: from the trees|tree%1:20:00:: beside the river. 
 
Behind them was|be%2:42:03:: the dark|dark%3:00:01:: forest|forest%1:14:00:: they had|have%2:30:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: through, 
although they had|have%2:39:06:: suffered|suffer%2:39:01:: many|many%3:00:00:: discouragements; but before them was|be%2:42:05:: a 
lovely, sunny|sunny%3:00:00:cheerful:00 country|country%1:15:02:: that seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to beckon|beckon%2:32:00:: them on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, the broad|broad%3:00:04:: river|river%1:17:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: them off|off%4:02:00:: from this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
land; but the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: done, and after the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: 
a few|few%3:00:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: logs|log%1:27:01:: and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: them together|together%4:02:02:: with wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pins, they 
were|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to start. Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the raft|raft%1:06:00:: and 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon the raft|raft%1:06:00:: 
it tipped|tip%2:38:01:: badly, for he was|be%2:42:03:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy; but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to steady|steady%3:00:00:secure:03 it, and they had|have%2:40:01:: long|long%4:02:00:: 
poles|pole%1:06:00:: in their hands|hand%1:08:00:: to push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: through the water. 
 
They got|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: at first, but when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the middle|middle%1:09:00:: 
of the river|river%1:17:00:: the swift|swift%3:00:00:fast:01 current|current%1:11:00:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: stream, farther|far%4:02:00:: 
and farther|far%4:02:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick; and the water|water%1:27:00:: grew|grow%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
deep|deep%4:02:00:: that the long|long%3:00:01:: poles|pole%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the bottom. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: bad," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for if we cannot get|get%2:38:00:: to the 
land|land%2:38:03:: we shall be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: into the country|country%1:15:02:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
West, and she will enchant|enchant%2:37:00:: us and make|make%2:30:00:: us her slaves." 
 
"And then|then%4:02:02:: I should get|get%2:40:00:: no brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I should never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"We must certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: if we can," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
continued, and he pushed|push%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: on his long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: that it stuck|stick%2:38:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: 
in the mud|mud%1:27:00:: at the bottom|bottom%1:17:00:: of the river, and before he could pull|pull%2:35:00:: it 
out again, or let|let%2:41:00:: go, the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
left|left%4:02:03:: clinging|cling%2:35:00:: to the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the river. 
 
"Good bye!" he called|call%2:32:09:: after them, and they were|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to leave|leave%2:38:01:: 
him; indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cry, but fortunately|fortunately%4:02:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:01:: 
that he might rust, and so|so%4:02:05:: dried|dry%2:30:01:: his tears|tear%1:08:01:: on Dorothy's apron. 
 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: this was|be%2:42:06:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: for the Scarecrow. 
 
"I am now|now%4:02:00:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: than when I first|first%4:02:02:: met|meet%2:38:01:: Dorothy," he thought. 
"Then, I was|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a cornfield, where I could make|make%2:36:00:: 
believe|believe%2:31:00:: scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows, at any rate; but surely|surely%4:02:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: no use|use%1:07:00:: for 
a Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a river. I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: any brains, after all!" 
 
 
 
Down the stream|stream%1:17:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: floated, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said: 
 
"Something must be|be%2:42:06:: done|do%2:36:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: us. I think|think%2:31:03:: I can swim|swim%2:38:00:: to the shore|shore%1:06:00:: 
and pull|pull%2:35:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: after me, if you will only|only%4:02:02:: hold|hold%2:42:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: to the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of 
my tail." 
 
 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: into the water|water%1:27:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his tail, when the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to swim|swim%2:38:00:: with all his might|might%1:07:00:: toward 
the shore. It was|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, although he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big; but by and by 
they were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:03:: out of the current, and then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy took|take%2:40:15:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman's long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: and helped|help%2:41:00:: push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: to the land. 
 
They were|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tire%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the shore|shore%1:17:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 and 
stepped|step%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grass, and they also|also%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: that the 
stream|stream%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them a long|long%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: past the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: that 
led|lead%2:42:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to let|let%2:41:00:: the sun|sun%1:19:00:: dry|dry%3:00:01:: him. 
 
"We must get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, in some way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The best|best%3:00:00:: plan|plan%1:09:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: along the river|river%1:17:00:: bank|bank%1:17:01:: until we come|come%2:38:04:: to 
the road|road%1:06:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So, when they were|be%2:42:03:: rested, Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and they 
started|start%2:38:02:: along the grassy|grassy%3:00:00:: bank, back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: from which the river|river%1:17:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 country, with plenty|plenty%1:23:00:: of flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
and fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: and sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: to cheer|cheer%2:37:02:: them, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:29:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
sorry for the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they could have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 happy. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could, Dorothy only|only%4:02:02:: stopping|stop%2:38:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: to 
pick|pick%2:31:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: flower; and after a time|time%1:28:05:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:07:: out, 
 
"Look!" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they all looked|look%2:39:00:: at the river|river%1:17:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon 
his pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the water, looking|look%2:39:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:uninhabited:00 and sad. 
 
"What can we do|do%2:41:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: him?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: both shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads, for they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know. So they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the bank|bank%1:17:01:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: wistfully|wistfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: until a Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: by, which, seeing|see%2:39:00:: them, stopped|stop%2:38:00:: to rest|rest%2:32:00:: 
at the water's edge. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl; "and these are|be%2:42:06:: my friends, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion; and we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"This isn't the road," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, as she twisted|twist%2:38:01:: her long|long%3:00:01:: neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: at the queer party. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, "but we have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: the Scarecrow, and 
are|be%2:42:03:: wondering|wonder%2:32:01:: how we shall get|get%2:35:03:: him again." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: he?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"Over there|there%4:02:00:: in the river," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"If he wasn't so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: I would get|get%2:35:03:: him for you," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Stork. 
 
"He isn't heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: a bit," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, eagerly, "for he is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: 
with straw; and if you will bring|bring%2:38:00:: him back|back%4:02:04:: to us we shall thank|thank%2:32:00:: you 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: and ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much." 
 
"Well, I'll try," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork; "but if I find|find%2:31:10:: he is|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to 
carry|carry%2:30:05:: I shall have|have%2:39:06:: to drop|drop%2:38:01:: him in the river|river%1:17:00:: again." 
 
So the big|big%3:00:01:: bird|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and over the water|water%1:17:00:: till she came|come%2:38:04:: to 
where the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon his pole. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: with 
her great|great%3:00:01:large:00 claws|claw%1:05:02:: grabbed|grab%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: by the arm|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: 
into the air|air%1:15:00:: and back|back%4:02:04:: to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and Toto were|be%2:42:03:: sitting. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:39:01:: himself among his friends|friend%1:18:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
happy|happy%3:00:00:: that he hugged|hug%2:35:01:: them all, even|even%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto; and as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he sang|sing%2:36:00:: "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt|feel%2:31:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: gay. 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: I should have|have%2:39:06:: to stay|stay%2:42:02:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: forever," he said, 
"but the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: me, and if I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: any brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
find|find%2:39:01:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and do|do%2:36:02:: it some kindness|kindness%1:04:00:: in return." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, who was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside them. 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: anyone in trouble. But I must go|go%2:38:01:: now, for 
my babies|baby%1:18:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: in the nest|nest%1:17:00:: for me. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: the 
Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and that Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the 
air|air%1:27:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along listening|listen%2:39:00:: to the singing|singing%1:04:00:: of the bright-colored 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: which now|now%4:02:05:: became|become%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 that 
the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: carpeted|carpet%2:35:01:: with them. There were|be%2:42:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: and 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 blossoms, besides great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clusters|cluster%1:14:00:: of scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: they almost|almost%4:02:00:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: Dorothy's eyes. 
 
"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked, as she breathed|breathe%2:29:00:: in the spicy 
scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "When I have|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
probably|probably%4:02:00:: like them better." 
 
"If I only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should love|love%2:37:00:: them," added|add%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: like flowers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "they seem|seem%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: helpless|helpless%3:00:00:dependent:00 
and frail. But there are|be%2:42:04:: none|none%1:28:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as these." 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon more|more%3:00:02:: and more|more%3:00:02:: of the big|big%3:00:01:: scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, and 
fewer|few%3:00:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: of the other|other%3:00:00:: flowers; and soon|soon%4:02:00:: they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 meadow|meadow%1:15:00:: of poppies. Now|now%1:28:00:: it is|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:00:: 
that when there are|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these flowers|flower%1:20:02:: together|together%4:02:03:: their odor|odor%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: that anyone who breathes|breathe%2:29:00:: it falls|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, and if the sleeper|sleeper%1:18:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: he sleeps|sleep%2:29:00:: on and on 
forever. But Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, nor could she get|get%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from 
the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that were|be%2:42:04:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: about; so|so%4:02:05:: presently|presently%4:02:00:: her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: heavy|heavy%3:00:03:: and she felt|feel%2:31:00:: she must sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to rest|rest%1:04:00:: and to sleep. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. 
 
"We must hurry|hurry%2:38:00:: and get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: before dark," 
he said; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. So they kept|keep%2:42:07:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: 
until Dorothy could stand|stand%2:35:00:: no longer. Her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of 
herself and she forgot|forget%2:31:01:: where she was|be%2:42:05:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: among the poppies, fast|fast%4:02:01:: 
asleep. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"If we leave|leave%2:31:05:: her here|here%4:02:00:: she will die," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "The smell|smell%1:07:00:: of the 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: killing|kill%2:30:04:: us all. I myself can scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:42:00:: my eyes|eye%1:08:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: 
and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: already." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: true; Toto had|have%2:42:00:: fallen|fall%2:30:08:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh, were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
troubled|trouble%2:37:01:: by the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
 
 
"Run fast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Lion, "and get|get%2:30:00:: out of this 
deadly|deadly%3:00:00:unpardonable:00 flower-bed as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as you can. We will bring|bring%2:38:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with us, but if you should fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried." 
 
So the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: aroused|arouse%2:37:01:: himself and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could 
go. In a moment|moment%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: out of sight. 
 
"Let us make|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with our hands, and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. So they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: Toto and put|put%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in Dorothy's lap, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: they made|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with their hands|hand%1:08:00:: for the seat|seat%1:06:01:: and their arms|arm%1:08:00:: for 
the arms|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:02:: between them through the flowers. 
 
On and on they walked, and it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: of deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: them would never|never%4:02:00:: end. They followed|follow%2:38:01:: the bend|bend%1:06:00:: 
of the river, and at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 came|come%2:38:04:: upon their friend|friend%1:18:00:: the Lion, lying|lie%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:01:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: among the poppies. The flowers|flower%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:intense:00 for 
the huge|huge%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: and he had|have%2:42:00:: given|give%2:38:13:: up, at last, and fallen|fall%2:38:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: a short|short%3:00:02:: 
distance|distance%1:07:00:: from the end|end%1:15:00:: of the poppy-bed, where the sweet|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 grass|grass%1:20:00:: spread|spread%1:04:00:: 
in beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: before them. 
 
"We can do|do%2:36:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: for him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly; "for he is|be%2:42:03:: 
much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to lift. We must leave|leave%2:31:05:: him here|here%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: on forever, 
and perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: he will dream|dream%2:39:00:: that he has|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: at last." 
 
"I'm sorry," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: 
for one so|so%4:02:02:: cowardly. But let|let%2:41:00:: us go|go%2:30:01:: on." 
 
They carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: to a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 spot|spot%1:15:01:: beside the river, 
far|far%4:02:02:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: from the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: field|field%1:15:00:: to prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: her breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: any more|more%3:00:02:: of 
the poison|poison%1:27:00:: of the flowers, and here|here%4:02:00:: they laid|lay%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: for the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: breeze|breeze%1:19:00:: to waken|waken%2:29:00:: her. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IX. 
 
 
"We cannot be|be%2:42:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, now," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, as he stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside the girl, "for we have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as 
far|far%4:02:02:: as the river|river%1:17:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: us away." 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when he heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:03:: growl, and 
turning|turn%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: (which worked|work%2:35:02:: beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: on hinges) he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a 
strange|strange%3:00:00:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: bounding|bound%2:38:01:: over the grass|grass%1:20:00:: towards them. It was, 
indeed, a great, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 wildcat, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it must be|be%2:42:06:: 
chasing|chase%2:38:00:: something, for its ears|ear%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to its head|head%1:08:00:: and its 
mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: open, showing|show%2:39:00:: two rows|row%1:14:00:: of ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: teeth, while its red|red%1:07:00:: 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: glowed|glow%2:39:00:: like balls|ball%1:25:00:: of fire. As it came|come%2:38:04:: nearer the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
saw|saw%2:35:00:: that running|run%2:38:00:: before the beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 field-mouse, and 
although he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: he knew|know%2:31:02:: it was|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: for the wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: to try|try%2:41:00:: 
to kill|kill%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a pretty, harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: creature. 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, and as the wildcat|wildcat%1:06:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: by he gave|give%2:40:03:: it a 
quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 blow|blow%1:04:01:: that cut|cut%2:35:00:: the beast's head|head%2:38:01:: clean|clean%3:00:00:perfect:00 off|off%4:02:03:: from its body, and it 
rolled|roll%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: at his feet|foot%1:08:01:: in two pieces. 
 
The field-mouse, now|now%4:02:05:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: freed|free%2:41:00:: from its enemy, stopped|stop%2:38:01:: short; 
and coming|come%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: up to the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: it said, in a squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you! Thank|thank%2:32:00:: you ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: for saving|save%2:41:00:: my life." 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:01:: of it, I beg|beg%2:32:01:: of you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
heart, you know, so I am|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: to help|help%2:29:00:: all those who may need|need%2:34:01:: a 
friend, even|even%4:02:00:: if it happens|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a mouse." 
 
"Only a mouse!" cried|cry%2:32:07:: the little|little%3:00:01:: animal, indignantly; "why, I am|be%2:42:03:: a 
Queen--the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: of all the field-mice!" 
 
"Oh, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, making|make%2:41:00:: a bow. 
 
"Therefore you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deed, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:07:: as a brave|brave%2:42:00:: one, in 
saving|save%2:41:05:: my life," added|add%2:32:01:: the Queen. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as their 
little|little%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: could carry|carry%2:35:02:: them, and when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: their Queen|queen%1:18:01:: they 
exclaimed, 
 
[Illustration: "_Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the 
Queen._"] 
 
"Oh, your Majesty, we thought|think%2:31:03:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: killed! How did|do%2:41:01:: you manage|manage%2:41:09:: 
to escape|escape%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wildcat?" and they all bowed|bow%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: low|low%3:00:01:: to the 
little|little%3:00:01:: Queen|queen%1:18:01:: that they almost|almost%4:02:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon their heads. 
 
"This funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 tin|tin%1:27:00:: man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: and saved|save%2:41:01:: my 
life. So|so%4:02:05:: hereafter|hereafter%4:02:00:: you must all serve|serve%2:41:01:: him, and obey|obey%2:41:00:: his slightest|slight%3:00:00:: wish." 
 
"We will!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: all the mice, in a shrill|shrill%3:00:00:high:03 chorus. And then|then%4:02:00:: they 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: in all directions, for Toto had|have%2:40:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: from his sleep, 
and seeing|see%2:39:00:: all these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: around him he gave|give%2:41:00:: one bark|bark%1:11:00:: of delight|delight%1:12:00:: and 
jumped|jump%2:38:00:: right|right%4:02:04:: into the middle|middle%1:09:00:: of the group. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: to 
chase mice|mouse%1:05:00:: when he lived|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, and he saw|saw%2:35:00:: no harm|harm%1:11:01:: in it. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in his arms|arm%1:08:00:: and held|hold%2:35:00:: him tight, 
while he called|call%2:32:09:: to the mice: "Come back! come|come%2:38:00:: back! Toto shall not|not%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: you." 
 
At this the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: stuck|stick%2:38:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: out from a clump|clump%1:14:00:: of 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and asked, in a timid|timid%3:00:00:cowardly:00 voice, 
 
"Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: he will not|not%4:02:00:: bite|bite%2:35:00:: us?" 
 
"I will not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
 
 
One by one the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: creeping|creep%2:38:00:: back, and Toto did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: bark|bark%2:32:00:: again, 
although he tried|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the Woodman's arms, and would have|have%2:40:00:: 
bitten|bite%2:35:00:: him had|have%2:40:00:: he not|not%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Finally|finally%4:02:03:: one 
of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: mice|mouse%1:05:00:: spoke. 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: anything we can do," it asked, "to repay|repay%2:40:00:: you for saving|save%2:41:01:: the 
life|life%1:18:00:: of our Queen?" 
 
"Nothing that I know|know%2:31:01:: of," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to think, but could not|not%4:02:00:: because his head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, said, quickly, 
 
"Oh, yes; you can save|save%2:41:01:: our friend, the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, who is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: 
in the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed." 
 
"A Lion!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: Queen; "why, he would eat|eat%2:34:00:: us all up." 
 
"Oh, no;" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "this Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Really?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Mouse. 
 
"He says|say%2:32:00:: so himself," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and he would never|never%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%1:12:02:: anyone who is|be%2:42:06:: our friend. If you will help|help%2:41:00:: us to save|save%2:41:01:: him I 
promise|promise%1:10:00:: that he shall treat|treat%2:41:00:: you all with kindness." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Queen, "we will trust|trust%2:31:00:: you. But what shall we do?" 
 
"Are there|there%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: which call|call%2:32:02:: you Queen|queen%1:18:00:: and are|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to 
obey|obey%2:41:00:: you?" 
 
"Oh, yes; there are|be%2:42:00:: thousands," she replied. 
 
"Then send|send%2:38:01:: for them all to come|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, and let|let%2:41:00:: 
each one bring|bring%2:38:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: piece|piece%1:06:00:: of string." 
 
The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: to the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: that attended|attend%2:41:00:: her and told|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: at 
once|once%4:02:00:: and get|get%2:35:03:: all her people. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they heard|hear%2:39:00:: her orders|order%1:10:03:: they 
ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: in every direction|direction%1:15:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as possible. 
 
"Now," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you must go|go%2:38:00:: to those 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: by the river-side and make|make%2:36:01:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: that will carry|carry%2:35:02:: the Lion." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: went|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:00:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to work; and he 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: out of the limbs|limb%1:20:00:: of trees, from which he chopped|chop%2:35:01:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: all the leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: and branches. He fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: it together|together%4:02:02:: with 
wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pegs|peg%2:35:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: the four wheels|wheel%1:06:00:: out of short|short%3:00:01:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: 
tree-trunk. So|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: and so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: he work|work%2:41:02:: that by the time|time%1:11:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to arrive|arrive%2:38:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: all ready|ready%3:00:00:: for them. 
 
They came|come%2:38:00:: from all directions, and there were|be%2:42:03:: thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of them: big|big%3:00:01:: 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and middle-sized mice; and each one brought|bring%2:38:00:: a 
piece|piece%1:11:00:: of string|string%1:06:00:: in his mouth. It was|be%2:42:04:: about this time|time%1:11:00:: that Dorothy woke|wake%2:29:01:: 
from her long|long%3:00:02:: sleep|sleep%1:26:00:: and opened|open%2:35:00:: her eyes. She was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: herself lying|lie%2:35:00:: upon the grass, with thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of mice|mouse%1:05:00:: standing|stand%2:42:02:: 
around|around%4:02:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at her timidly. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her about 
everything, and turning|turn%2:38:00:: to the dignified|dignified%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Mouse, he said, 
 
"Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the Queen." 
 
Dorothy nodded|nod%2:32:00:: gravely|gravely%4:02:00:: and the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: made|make%2:41:00:: a courtesy, after which she 
became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: with the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to fasten|fasten%2:35:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: to the 
truck, using|use%2:34:01:: the strings|string%1:06:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: brought. One end|end%1:15:00:: of a string|string%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
tied|tie%2:35:00:: around the neck|neck%1:08:00:: of each mouse|mouse%1:05:00:: and the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to the truck. 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a thousand times|time%1:28:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than any of the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
who were|be%2:42:03:: to draw|draw%2:35:01:: it; but when all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: they 
were|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to pull|pull%2:35:00:: it quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. Even|even%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could sit|sit%2:35:00:: on it, and were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:06:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: by their queer|queer%1:18:00:: little|little%4:02:00:: 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: to the place|place%1:15:00:: where the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: asleep. 
 
 
 
After a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heavy, they managed|manage%2:41:08:: 
to get|get%2:30:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: on the truck. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: hurriedly|hurriedly%4:02:00:: gave|give%2:40:02:: her people|people%1:14:01:: 
the order|order%1:10:03:: to start, for she feared|fear%2:37:03:: if the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: stayed|stay%2:42:02:: among the 
poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: they also|also%4:02:00:: would fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep. 
 
 
 
At first|first%4:02:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: creatures, many|many%3:00:00:: though they were, could hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: 
the heavily|heavily%4:02:00:: loaded|loaded%3:00:00:full:00 truck; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: both pushed|push%2:41:00:: 
from behind, and they got|get%2:30:00:: along better. Soon|soon%4:02:00:: they rolled|roll%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed|bed%1:06:01:: to the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields, where he could breathe|breathe%2:29:00:: the sweet, 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: again, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the poisonous|poisonous%3:00:00:toxic:00 scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
Dorothy came|come%2:38:00:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: warmly|warmly%4:02:00:: for 
saving|save%2:41:01:: her companion|companion%1:18:00:: from death. She had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the big|big%3:00:00:conspicuous:00 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: rescued. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: unharnessed from the truck|truck%1:06:00:: and scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to their homes. The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the last|last%3:00:00:: 
to leave. 
 
"If ever|ever%4:02:04:: you need|need%2:42:00:: us again," she said, "come out|out%4:02:04:: into the field|field%1:15:00:: and 
call, and we shall hear|hear%2:39:00:: you and come|come%2:38:04:: to your assistance. Good|good%1:06:00:: bye!" 
 
"Good bye!" they all answered, and away|away%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: ran, while Dorothy 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: lest he should run|run%2:38:00:: after her and frighten her. 
 
After this they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: until he should awaken; and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: Dorothy some fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: from a tree|tree%1:20:00:: near by, which 
she ate|eat%2:34:00:: for her dinner. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: X. 
 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: some time|time%1:28:05:: before the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: awakened, for he had|have%2:39:06:: lain|lie%2:35:00:: 
among the poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: while, breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: in their deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fragrance; 
but when he did|do%2:41:01:: open|open%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and roll|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: himself still|still%4:02:01:: alive. 
 
"I ran|run%2:38:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as I could," he said, sitting|sit%2:38:00:: down and yawning; "but 
the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: for me. How did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:30:00:: me out?" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they told|tell%2:32:01:: him of the field-mice, and how they had|have%2:40:00:: generously|generously%4:02:00:: 
saved|save%2:41:01:: him from death; and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: laughed, and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: myself very|very%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: and terrible; yet|yet%4:02:02:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:06:01:: as flowers|flower%1:20:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: near to killing|kill%2:35:00:: me, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: as 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How strange|strange%3:00:00:: it all is! But, comrades, what 
shall we do|do%2:36:01:: now?" 
 
"We must journey|journey%1:04:00:: on until we find|find%2:40:02:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: again," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "and then|then%4:02:00:: we can keep|keep%2:42:07:: on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
So, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: fully|fully%4:02:02:: refreshed, and feeling|feeling%1:09:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: himself again, 
they all started|start%2:30:00:: upon the journey, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: enjoying|enjoy%2:37:00:: the walk|walk%1:04:03:: through 
the soft, fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: grass; and it was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: before they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: where 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz dwelt. 
 
 
 
The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: and well|well%4:02:00:: paved, now, and the country|country%1:15:01:: about was|be%2:42:03:: 
beautiful; so that the travelers|traveler%1:18:00:: rejoiced|rejoice%2:37:00:: in leaving|leave%2:38:01:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind, and with it the many|many%3:00:00:: dangers|danger%1:26:01:: they had|have%2:39:06:: met|meet%2:38:01:: in its gloomy|gloomy%3:00:00:depressing:00 
shades. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: built|build%2:36:00:: beside the road; but 
these were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green, and when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: house, in 
which a farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: lived, that also|also%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green. They 
passed|pass%2:38:05:: by several|several%3:00:00:some:00 of these houses|house%1:06:00:: during the afternoon, and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to the doors|door%1:06:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at them as if they would like|like%2:37:01:: to 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: questions; but no one|one%1:23:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near them nor spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them because of 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion, of which they were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: afraid. The people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in clothing|clothing%1:06:00:: of a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 emerald green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: peaked|peaked%3:00:00:ill:01 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: like those of the Munchkins. 
 
 
 
"This must be|be%2:42:06:: the Land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "and we are|be%2:42:06:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: 
getting|get%2:30:00:: near the Emerald City." 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "everything is|be%2:42:03:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 here, while in 
the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:loved:00 color. But the 
people|people%1:14:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: as the Munchkins and I'm afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 
we shall be|be%2:42:03:: unable|unable%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a place|place%1:15:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"I should like|like%2:37:01:: something to eat|eat%2:34:00:: besides fruit," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: Toto is|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: starved. Let|let%1:14:00:: us stop|stop%2:38:00:: at the next|next%3:00:00:close:01 house|house%1:06:00:: and 
talk|talk%2:32:01:: to the people." 
 
So, when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 sized|size%2:30:00:: farm|farm%1:06:00:: house, Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: 
up to the door|door%1:06:00:: and knocked. A|a%1:10:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: it just|just%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: 
out, and said, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you want, child, and why is|be%2:42:03:: that great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: with you?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with you, if you will allow|allow%2:32:00:: us," answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
Dorothy; "and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my friend|friend%1:18:00:: and comrade, and would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: 
you for the world." 
 
"Is he tame?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the woman, opening|open%2:35:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: wider. 
 
"Oh, yes;" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and he is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 coward, too; so that he 
will be|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of you than you are|be%2:42:03:: of him." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the woman, after thinking|think%2:31:00:: it over and taking|take%2:34:00:: another 
peep|peep%1:04:00:: at the Lion, "if that is|be%2:42:06:: the case|case%1:09:00:: you may come|come%2:38:00:: in, and I will 
give|give%2:40:00:: you some supper|supper%1:13:00:: and a place|place%1:15:00:: to sleep." 
 
So they all entered|enter%2:38:00:: the house, where there|there%4:02:00:: were, besides the woman, 
two children|child%1:18:00:: and a man. The man|man%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: his leg, and was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the 
couch|couch%1:06:00:: in a corner. They seemed|seem%2:39:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: a 
company, and while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: laying|lay%2:35:01:: the table|table%1:06:01:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:03:: you all going?" 
 
"To the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz." 
 
"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man. "Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: that Oz will see|see%2:38:00:: you?" 
 
"Why not?" she replied. 
 
"Why, it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: that he never|never%4:02:00:: lets|let%2:41:00:: any one come|come%2:38:00:: into his presence. I 
have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: times, and it is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and 
wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place; but I have|have%2:41:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: permitted|permit%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz, 
nor do|do%2:41:01:: I know|know%2:31:00:: of any living|live%2:42:00:: person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"Does he never|never%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: out?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Never. He sits|sit%2:35:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: after day|day%1:28:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: of his palace, 
and even|even%4:02:00:: those who wait|wait%2:42:00:: upon him do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: him face|face%2:38:00:: to face." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:03:: he like?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to tell," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wizard, and can take|take%2:30:01:: on|on%4:02:00:: any form|form%1:09:00:: he wishes. So|so%4:02:02:: that some say|say%2:32:01:: he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: like a bird; and some say|say%2:32:01:: he looks|look%2:42:02:: like an elephant; and some 
say|say%2:32:00:: he looks|look%2:39:01:: like a cat. To others he appears|appear%2:39:00:: as a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: fairy, 
or a brownie, or in any other|other%3:00:00:: form|form%1:03:00:: that pleases|please%2:37:00:: him. But who the real|real%1:23:00:: 
Oz is, when he is|be%2:42:03:: in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 form, no living|live%2:42:04:: person|person%1:03:00:: can tell." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:same:02 strange," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "but we must try, in some way, 
to see|see%2:39:02:: him, or we shall have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: our journey|journey%1:04:00:: for nothing." 
 
 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Oz?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, eagerly. 
 
"Oh, Oz could do|do%2:41:01:: that easily|easily%4:02:01:: enough," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the man. "He has|have%2:40:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
brains|brain%1:18:00:: than he needs." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That will not|not%4:02:00:: trouble|trouble%1:11:00:: him," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the man, "for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: a large|large%3:00:00:: 
collection|collection%1:14:00:: of hearts, of all sizes|size%1:07:00:: and shapes." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Oz keeps|keep%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pot|pot%1:23:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: in his throne|throne%1:06:00:: room," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, 
"which he has|have%2:40:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 plate, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: it from running|run%2:38:01:: 
over. He will be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: you some." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: Kansas?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in surprise. 
 
"I don't know," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sorrowfully; "but it is|be%2:42:06:: my home, and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: it's somewhere." 
 
"Very likely. Well, Oz can do|do%2:41:04:: anything; so I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: he will find|find%2:38:10:: 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for you. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must get|get%2:30:00:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him, and that will be|be%2:42:06:: 
a hard|hard%3:00:06:: task; for the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: does|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: anyone, and 
he usually|usually%4:02:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 way. But what do|do%2:41:04:: you want?" he continued, 
speaking|speak%2:32:01:: to Toto. Toto only|only%4:02:01:: wagged|wag%2:38:00:: his tail; for, strange|strange%3:00:00:: to say, he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: speak. 
 
 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: called|call%2:32:09:: to them that supper|supper%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready, so they gathered|gather%2:41:00:: 
around the table|table%1:06:01:: and Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: some delicious|delicious%3:00:00:tasty:00 porridge|porridge%1:13:00:: and a dish|dish%1:06:00:: of 
scrambled|scramble%2:35:02:: eggs|egg%1:13:00:: and a plate|plate%1:23:00:: of nice|nice%3:00:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: bread, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: her meal. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: some of the porridge, but did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:00:: for it, saying|say%2:32:00:: it 
was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:11:: from oats|oat%1:13:00:: and oats|oat%1:13:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: food|food%1:03:00:: for horses, not|not%4:02:00:: for lions. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: at all. Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: of 
everything, and was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: a good|good%3:00:01:: supper|supper%1:13:00:: again. 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: gave|give%2:40:00:: Dorothy a bed|bed%1:06:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: in, and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside 
her, while the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: of her room|room%1:06:00:: so she might not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
disturbed. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a corner|corner%1:15:02:: and 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: quiet|quiet%3:00:02:: all night, although of course|course%1:17:00:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: up, they started|start%2:30:00:: on their 
way, and soon|soon%4:02:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: in the sky|sky%1:17:00:: just|just%4:02:04:: before them. 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
As they walked|walk%2:38:00:: on, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: brighter and brighter, and it 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they were|be%2:42:03:: nearing|near%2:38:00:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of their travels. Yet it 
was|be%2:42:03:: afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: before they came|come%2:38:04:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: the 
City. It was|be%2:42:03:: high, and thick, and of a bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color. 
 
In front|front%1:15:00:: of them, and at the end|end%1:15:00:: of the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, was|be%2:42:05:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
gate, all studded|stud%2:42:00:: with emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: that glittered|glitter%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: that even|even%4:02:00:: 
the painted|painted%3:00:00:artificial:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by their brilliancy. 
 
There was|be%2:42:04:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed|push%2:38:02:: the button|button%1:06:01:: and 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: a silvery|silvery%3:00:00:bright:00 tinkle|tinkle%1:11:00:: sound|sound%1:09:00:: within. Then|then%4:02:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: gate|gate%1:06:00:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
open, and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through and found|find%2:39:05:: themselves in a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: room, the walls|wall%1:06:00:: of which glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: with countless|countless%3:00:00:incalculable:00 emeralds. 
 
Before them stood|stand%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: about the same|same%3:00:00:: size|size%1:07:00:: as the Munchkins. 
He was|be%2:42:03:: clothed|clothe%2:29:00:: all in green, from his head|head%1:08:00:: to his feet, and even|even%4:02:00:: his 
skin|skin%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: of a greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint. At his side|side%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:05:: a large|large%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box. 
 
When he saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: in the Emerald City?" 
 
"We came|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The man|man%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: surprised|surprised%3:00:00:: at this answer|answer%1:10:00:: that he sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it 
over. 
 
"It has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: since anyone asked|ask%2:32:01:: me to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz," he said, 
shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in perplexity. "He is|be%2:42:03:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: and terrible, and if 
you come|come%2:38:04:: on an idle|idle%3:00:00:frivolous:00 or foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand|errand%1:04:00:: to bother|bother%2:41:01:: the wise|wise%3:00:00:: reflections|reflection%1:09:00:: of 
the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Wizard, he might be|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: you all in an instant." 
 
 
 
"But it is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand, nor an idle|idle%3:00:00:: one," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow; "it is|be%2:42:03:: important. And we have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: told|tell%2:32:01:: that Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:reputable:00 
Wizard." 
 
"So he is," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man; "and he rules|rule%2:41:00:: the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: wisely|wisely%4:02:00:: 
and well. But to those who are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: honest, or who approach|approach%2:32:00:: him from 
curiosity, he is|be%2:42:03:: most|most%4:02:01:: terrible, and few|few%3:00:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: dared|dare%2:41:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
his face. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates, and since you demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz I must take|take%2:38:09:: you to his palace. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must put|put%2:35:00:: on 
the spectacles." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Because if you did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:04:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: the brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: and glory|glory%1:07:00:: of 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: would blind|blind%3:00:00:: you. Even|even%4:02:00:: those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:01:: 
must wear|wear%2:29:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day. They are|be%2:42:03:: all locked|lock%2:35:01:: on, for Oz 
so|so%4:02:05:: ordered|order%2:32:00:: it when the City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: first|first%3:00:00:: built, and I have|have%2:40:00:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 key|key%1:06:00:: 
that will unlock|unlock%2:35:00:: them." 
 
 
 
He opened|open%2:35:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: box, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: of every size|size%1:07:00:: and shape. All of them had|have%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: 
in them. The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the gates|gate%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: that would just|just%4:02:00:: fit|fit%2:42:02:: 
Dorothy and put|put%2:35:00:: them over her eyes. There were|be%2:42:04:: two golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 bands|band%1:06:00:: 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: to them that passed|pass%2:42:08:: around the back|back%1:06:00:: of her head, where they 
were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: by a little|little%3:00:01:: key|key%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:05:: at the end|end%1:15:00:: of a chain|chain%1:06:00:: the 
Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: around his neck. When they were|be%2:42:03:: on, Dorothy 
could not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: she wished, but of course|course%1:15:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:34:00:: 
to be|be%2:42:03:: blinded|blind%2:39:01:: by the glare|glare%1:07:00:: of the Emerald City, so she said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man|man%1:18:00:: fitted|fitted%3:44:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: for the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and even|even%4:02:00:: on little|little%3:00:01:: Toto; and all were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:02:: with the key. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: put|put%2:35:00:: on his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: and told|tell%2:32:04:: them 
he was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to show|show%2:32:01:: them to the palace. Taking|take%2:35:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 key|key%1:06:00:: from 
a peg|peg%2:35:00:: on the wall|wall%1:06:00:: he opened|open%2:35:00:: another gate, and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him 
through the portal|portal%1:06:01:: into the streets|street%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XI. 
 
 
Even|even%4:02:00:: with eyes|eye%1:08:00:: protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: Dorothy and her 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: at first|first%4:02:02:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by the brilliancy|brilliancy%1:07:00:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 City. 
The streets|street%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lined|line%2:35:00:: with beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: all built|build%2:36:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
and studded|stud%2:42:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: with sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 emeralds. They walked|walk%2:38:00:: over a 
pavement|pavement%1:06:01:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble, and where the blocks|block%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: joined|join%2:35:01:: 
together|together%4:02:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: rows|row%1:14:00:: of emeralds, set|set%2:35:02:: closely, and glittering in the 
brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: of the sun. The window|window%1:06:04:: panes|pane%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glass; even|even%4:02:00:: the 
sky|sky%1:17:00:: above the City|city%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint, and the rays|ray%1:19:00:: of the sun|sun%1:17:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: green. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: people, men, women|woman%1:18:00:: and children, walking|walking%1:04:00:: about, and 
these were|be%2:42:03:: all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and had|have%2:40:00:: greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 skins. They 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy and her strangely|strangely%4:02:01:: assorted|assorted%3:00:00:heterogeneous:00 company|company%1:26:00:: with wondering|wonder%2:32:12:: 
eyes, and the children|child%1:18:00:: all ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: behind their mothers|mother%1:18:00:: when 
they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Lion; but no one|one%1:23:00:: spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them. Many|many%3:00:00:: shops|shop%1:06:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the 
street, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that everything in them was|be%2:42:03:: green. Green|green%1:07:00:: 
candy|candy%1:13:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pop-corn were|be%2:42:03:: offered|offer%2:40:00:: for sale, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:08:: as green|green%1:07:00:: 
shoes, green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hats|hat%1:06:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of all sorts. At one place|place%1:15:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: selling|sell%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lemonade, and when the children|child%1:18:00:: bought|buy%2:40:00:: it Dorothy 
could see|see%2:39:00:: that they paid|pay%2:40:00:: for it with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pennies. 
 
There seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:04:: no horses|horse%1:05:00:: nor animals|animal%1:03:00:: of any kind; the men|man%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: 
things|thing%1:06:00:: around|around%4:02:06:: in little|little%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carts, which they pushed|push%2:38:00:: before them. 
Everyone seemed|seem%2:39:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and contented|contented%3:00:00:: and prosperous. 
 
The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:00:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:00:: to a big|big%3:00:01:: building, exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the City, which was|be%2:42:05:: 
the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard. There was|be%2:42:04:: a soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: before the 
door, dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 uniform|uniform%1:06:00:: and wearing|wear%2:29:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 beard. 
 
"Here are|be%2:42:04:: strangers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: to him, "and 
they demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz." 
 
"Step inside," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and I will carry|carry%2:35:02:: your message|message%1:10:01:: 
to him." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the Palace|palace%1:14:00:: gates|gate%1:06:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: led|lead%2:38:01:: into a big|big%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: 
with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: and lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 furniture|furniture%1:06:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: with emeralds. 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: them all wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: their feet|foot%1:08:01:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 mat|mat%1:06:00:: before 
entering|enter%2:38:00:: this room, and when they were|be%2:42:03:: seated|seat%2:35:00:: he said, politely, 
 
"Please make|make%2:30:00:: yourselves comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: while I go|go%2:38:00:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: of the 
Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:00:: Oz you are|be%2:42:05:: here." 
 
They had|have%2:40:01:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: before the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: returned. When, at 
last, he came|come%2:38:00:: back, Dorothy asked, 
 
"Have you seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz?" 
 
 
 
"Oh, no;" returned|return%2:32:01:: the soldier; "I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him. But I spoke|speak%2:32:00:: 
to him as he sat|sit%2:42:00:: behind his screen, and gave|give%2:40:00:: him your message. He 
says|say%2:32:00:: he will grant|grant%2:40:01:: you an audience, if you so|so%4:02:05:: desire; but each one 
of you must enter|enter%2:38:00:: his presence|presence%1:15:00:: alone, and he will admit|admit%2:41:01:: but one each 
day. Therefore, as you must remain|remain%2:42:03:: in the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 days, I 
will have|have%2:30:00:: you shown|show%2:38:00:: to rooms|room%1:06:00:: where you may rest|rest%2:32:00:: in comfort|comfort%1:26:00:: after your 
journey." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the girl; "that is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 kind|kind%1:09:00:: of Oz." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: blew|blow%2:29:00:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whistle, and at once|once%4:02:02:: a young|young%3:00:00:: girl, 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, entered|enter%2:38:00:: the room. She had|have%2:42:00:: 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 eyes, and she bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy as 
she said, 
 
"Follow me and I will show|show%2:32:01:: you your room." 
 
So Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye to all her friends|friend%1:18:00:: except Toto, and taking|take%2:31:03:: 
the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: through seven passages|passage%1:08:00:: 
and up|up%4:02:00:: three flights|flight%1:06:00:: of stairs|stair%1:06:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a room|room%1:06:00:: at the front|front%1:15:00:: 
of the Palace. It was|be%2:42:03:: the sweetest|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: in the world, with 
a soft, comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: that had|have%2:42:00:: sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: and a green|green%1:07:00:: 
velvet|velvet%1:06:00:: counterpane. There was|be%2:42:04:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 fountain|fountain%1:06:02:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the 
room, that shot|shoot%2:38:03:: a spray|spray%1:11:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 perfume|perfume%1:06:00:: into the air, to fall|fall%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: 
into a beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved|carve%2:35:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: basin. Beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the windows, and there was|be%2:42:04:: a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: with a row|row%1:14:00:: of little|little%3:00:01:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 books. When Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to open|open%2:35:00:: these books|book%1:06:00:: she found|find%2:40:02:: them 
full|full%3:00:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pictures|picture%1:06:00:: that made|make%2:32:00:: her laugh, they were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: funny. 
 
In a wardrobe|wardrobe%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 dresses, made|make%2:42:05:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and satin|satin%1:06:00:: and 
velvet; and all of them fitted|fit%2:42:05:: Dorothy exactly. 
 
"Make yourself perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: at home," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "and if you 
wish|wish%1:10:01:: for anything ring|ring%1:11:00:: the bell. Oz will send|send%2:32:00:: for you to-morrow 
morning." 
 
She left|leave%2:31:05:: Dorothy alone|alone%4:02:01:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the others. These she also|also%4:02:00:: 
led|lead%2:38:01:: to rooms, and each one of them found|find%2:39:01:: himself lodged|lodge%2:42:00:: in a very|very%4:02:00:: 
pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: part|part%1:24:00:: of the Palace. Of course|course%1:15:00:: this politeness|politeness%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: wasted|waste%2:34:05:: on 
the Scarecrow; for when he found|find%2:39:05:: himself alone|alone%4:02:01:: in his room|room%1:06:00:: he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
stupidly|stupidly%4:02:00:: in one spot, just|just%4:02:05:: within the doorway, to wait|wait%2:42:00:: till morning. 
It would not|not%4:02:00:: rest|rest%2:32:01:: him to lie|lie%2:38:00:: down, and he could not|not%4:02:00:: close|close%2:35:00:: his eyes; 
so|so%4:02:09:: he remained|remain%2:42:03:: all night|night%1:28:00:: staring|star%2:30:00:: at a little|little%3:00:01:: spider|spider%1:05:00:: which was|be%2:42:03:: weaving|weave%2:36:00:: 
its web|web%1:06:00:: in a corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the room, just|just%4:02:05:: as if it were|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: one of the 
most|most%4:02:01:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: in the world. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his 
bed|bed%1:06:00:: from force|force%1:04:00:: of habit, for he remembered|remember%2:31:00:: when he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh; 
but not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: he passed|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: moving|move%2:38:01:: his joints|joint%1:08:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
and down|down%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 they kept|keep%2:42:07:: in good|good%3:00:01:: working|work%2:35:02:: order. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would 
have|have%2:40:00:: preferred|prefer%2:37:00:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in the forest, and did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: 
being|be%2:42:03:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a room; but he had|have%2:40:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: sense|sense%1:09:04:: to let|let%2:41:00:: this worry|worry%1:09:00:: 
him, so he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: upon the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: like a cat|cat%1:05:00:: and 
purred|purr%2:32:00:: himself asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: in a minute. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, after breakfast, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to fetch|fetch%2:35:00:: 
Dorothy, and she dressed|dress%2:29:01:: her in one of the prettiest|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 gowns--made of 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brocaded|brocaded%3:00:00:adorned:00 satin. Dorothy put|put%2:35:05:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: apron|apron%1:06:00:: and tied|tie%2:35:00:: a 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck, and they started|start%2:38:02:: for the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: 
of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
 
 
First|first%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 hall|hall%1:06:02:: in which were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: ladies|lady%1:18:01:: and 
gentlemen|gentleman%1:18:00:: of the court, all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in rich|rich%3:00:00:: costumes. These people|people%1:14:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but talk|talk%2:32:01:: to each other, but they always|always%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to 
wait|wait%2:42:00:: outside the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: every morning, although they were|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: 
permitted|permit%2:41:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: As Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: at her curiously, 
and one of them whispered, 
 
"Are you really|really%4:02:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon the face|face%1:08:00:: of Oz the Terrible?" 
 
"Of course," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl, "if he will see|see%2:41:11:: me." 
 
"Oh, he will see|see%2:38:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: her message|message%1:10:01:: 
to the Wizard, "although he does|do%2:36:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to have|have%2:40:00:: people|people%1:14:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
him. Indeed, at first|first%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: I should send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: 
where you came|come%2:42:09:: from. Then|then%4:02:00:: he asked|ask%2:32:00:: me what you looked|look%2:39:01:: like, and when 
I mentioned|mention%2:32:02:: your silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: interested. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him about the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead, and he decided|decide%2:31:00:: he would 
admit|admit%2:41:01:: you to his presence." 
 
Just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: rang, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: the signal. You must go|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: alone." 
 
She opened|open%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: door|door%1:06:00:: and Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: through and found|find%2:30:13:: 
herself in a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place. It was|be%2:42:03:: a big, round|round%1:13:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: with a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: roof, and the walls|wall%1:06:00:: and ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and floor|floor%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with 
large|large%3:00:00:: emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: closely|closely%4:02:00:: together. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the roof|roof%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 light, as|as%4:02:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as the sun, which made|make%2:30:00:: the emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: sparkle|sparkle%1:07:00:: in 
a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 manner. 
 
But what interested|interest%2:42:00:: Dorothy most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
that stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the room. It was|be%2:42:03:: shaped|shape%2:30:00:: like a chair|chair%1:06:00:: 
and sparkled|sparkle%2:43:00:: with gems, as did|do%2:36:01:: everything else. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the 
chair|chair%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: an enormous|enormous%3:00:00:large:00 Head, without body|body%1:08:01:: to support|support%2:35:00:: it or any arms|arm%1:08:00:: or 
legs|leg%1:08:02:: whatever. There was|be%2:42:04:: no hair|hair%1:08:00:: upon this head, but it had|have%2:40:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and 
nose|nose%1:08:00:: and mouth, and was|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the head|head%1:08:00:: of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: giant. 
 
As Dorothy gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon this in wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: and fear|fear%2:37:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply|sharply%4:02:02:: and steadily. Then|then%4:02:00:: the mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: moved, and 
Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: a voice|voice%1:10:00:: say: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an awful|awful%3:00:00:bad:00 voice|voice%1:07:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to come|come%2:42:04:: from the 
big|big%3:00:01:: Head; so she took|take%2:41:04:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: and answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy, the Small|small%1:08:00:: and Meek. I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: to you for help." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: for a full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 minute. Then|then%4:02:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: the 
voice: 
 
"Where did|do%2:36:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes?" 
 
"I got|get%2:40:00:: them from the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the East, when my house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: on 
her and killed|kill%2:35:00:: her," she replied. 
 
"Where did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead?" continued|continue%2:42:01:: the voice. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: where the good|good%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: me when she bade|bid%2:32:00:: me 
good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: and sent|send%2:38:01:: me to you," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
Again|again%4:02:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply, and they saw|saw%2:35:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: telling|tell%2:32:04:: 
the truth. Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:00:: me to do?" 
 
"Send me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, where my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: are," she 
answered, earnestly. "I don't like your country, although it is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
beautiful. And I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: will be|be%2:42:03:: dreadfully|dreadfully%4:02:00:: worried|worry%2:37:00:: over my 
being|be%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:29:00:: three times, and then|then%4:02:00:: they turned|turn%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and 
down|down%4:02:00:: to the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: queerly|queerly%4:02:01:: that they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room. And at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 they looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy again. 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and I am|be%2:42:03:: weak; because you are|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: 
and I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a helpless|helpless%3:00:01:powerless:00 little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," she answered. 
 
"But you were|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"That just|just%4:02:01:: happened," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, simply; "I could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head, "I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my answer. You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: 
to expect|expect%2:32:00:: me to send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: unless you do|do%2:41:01:: something for 
me in return. In this country|country%1:14:01:: everyone must pay|pay%2:40:00:: for everything he 
gets. If you wish|wish%2:37:02:: me to use|use%2:34:01:: my magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 power|power%1:07:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: you home|home%1:15:02:: again|again%4:02:00:: you 
must do|do%2:41:01:: something for me first. Help|help%2:41:00:: me and I will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"What must I|i%1:27:00:: do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Kill the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"But I cannot!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised. 
 
"You killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and you wear|wear%2:29:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes, 
which bear|bear%2:42:14:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm. There is|be%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:00:: but one Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: 
in all this land, and when you can tell|tell%2:32:00:: me she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will send|send%2:35:00:: 
you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas--but not|not%4:02:00:: before." 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep, she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed; and the 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: upon her anxiously, as if the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz 
felt|feel%2:31:00:: that she could help|help%2:41:00:: him if she would. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything, willingly," she sobbed; "and even|even%4:02:00:: if I wanted|want%2:37:00:: 
to, how could I kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch? If you, who are|be%2:42:06:: Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 and 
Terrible, cannot kill|kill%2:35:00:: her yourself, how do|do%2:41:01:: you expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to do|do%2:41:01:: it?" 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head; "but that is|be%2:42:06:: my answer, and until the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:offensive:01 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: dies|die%2:30:00:: you will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: your Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: again. Remember|remember%2:31:01:: 
that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be|be%2:42:03:: killed. 
Now|now%4:02:02:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:04:: your task." 
 
Sorrowfully Dorothy left|leave%2:38:01:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: where the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: what 
Oz had|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to her. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no hope|hope%1:09:00:: for me," she said, sadly, "for Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: me 
home|home%1:15:04:: until I have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West; and that I can 
never|never%4:02:00:: do." 
 
Her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: sorry, but could do|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: her; so she went|go%2:38:01:: 
to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 room|room%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: herself to sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and said, 
 
"Come with me, for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and was|be%2:42:03:: admitted|admit%2:41:01:: into the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room, where he saw, sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in the emerald throne, a most|most%4:02:01:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady. She was|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gauze|gauze%1:06:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: upon her flowing|flow%2:35:04:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 locks|lock%1:08:00:: a crown|crown%1:06:02:: of jewels. Growing|grow%2:30:02:: from her shoulders|shoulder%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: wings, 
gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: and so|so%4:02:02:: light|light%3:00:01:: that they fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: if the slightest|slight%3:00:00:insignificant:00 
breath|breath%1:19:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: them. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: bowed, as|as%4:02:00:: prettily|prettily%4:02:00:: as his straw|straw%1:27:00:: stuffing|stuff%2:30:02:: would 
let|let%2:41:00:: him, before this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: creature, she looked|look%2:39:00:: upon him sweetly, 
and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, who had|have%2:39:06:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head|head%1:18:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him of, was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: astonished; but he answered|answer%2:32:00:: her bravely. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a Scarecrow, stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
brains, and I come|come%2:38:00:: to you praying|pray%2:32:00:: that you will put|put%2:35:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in my head|head%1:09:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:01:: of straw, so that I may become|become%2:42:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any other|other%3:00:00:: in 
your dominions." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the lady. 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: and powerful, and no one|one%1:23:00:: else can help|help%2:41:00:: me," 
answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:40:05:: favors|favor%1:04:00:: without some return," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "but this much|much%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will promise. If you will kill|kill%2:35:00:: for me the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:01:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will bestow|bestow%2:40:00:: upon you a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: brains, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 good|good%3:00:01:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: that 
you will be|be%2:42:03:: the wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: you asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," said, the Scarecrow, 
in surprise. 
 
 
 
"So I did. I don't care|care%1:12:01:: who kills|kill%2:35:00:: her. But until she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will 
not|not%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:32:00:: your wish. Now|now%1:28:00:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seek|seek%2:35:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: 
earned|earn%2:40:03:: the brains|brain%1:09:00:: you so|so%4:02:02:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: desire." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: and told|tell%2:32:01:: them what 
Oz had|have%2:42:00:: said; and Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: that the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Head, as she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him, but a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "she needs|need%2:34:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: as the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman." 
 
On the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and said, 
 
"Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you. Follow|follow%2:38:00:: me," 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and came|come%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. He 
did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: whether he would find|find%2:31:10:: Oz a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: or a Head, but 
he hoped|hop%2:38:03:: it would be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. "For," he said|say%2:32:00:: to himself, "if 
it is|be%2:42:06:: the Head, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:03:: a heart, since a head|head%1:08:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: of its own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 and therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: cannot feel|feel%1:26:00:: for me. But if it 
is|be%2:42:03:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: I shall beg|beg%2:32:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: for a heart, for all ladies|lady%1:18:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: 
themselves said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: hearted." 
 
But when the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he saw|saw%2:35:00:: neither 
the Head|head%1:08:00:: nor the Lady, for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the shape|shape%1:09:00:: of a most|most%4:02:01:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 
Beast. It was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as an elephant, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to hold|hold%2:35:01:: its weight. The Beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a head|head%1:08:00:: 
like that of a rhinoceros, only|only%4:02:06:: there were|be%2:42:04:: five eyes|eye%1:08:00:: in its face. 
There were|be%2:42:04:: five long|long%3:00:01:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:02:: out of its body|body%1:08:01:: and it also|also%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
five long, slim|slim%3:00:00:thin:03 legs. Thick, woolly|woolly%3:00:00:soft:01 hair|hair%1:08:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: every part|part%1:24:00:: of it, 
and a more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: monster|monster%1:18:02:: could not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: imagined. It was|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: at that moment, for it would 
have|have%2:42:00:: beat|beat%2:38:00:: loud|loud%4:02:00:: and fast|fast%4:02:01:: from terror. But being|be%2:42:03:: only|only%3:00:00:single:05 tin, the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all afraid, although he was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed. 
 
"I am Oz, the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 and Terrible," spake the Beast, in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: that 
was|be%2:42:03:: one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar. "Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Woodman, and made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and cannot 
love. I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that I may be|be%2:42:06:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: the Beast. 
 
"Because I ask|ask%2:32:01:: it, and you alone|alone%4:02:00:: can grant|grant%2:40:03:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman. 
 
Oz gave|give%2:41:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 growl|growl%1:11:00:: at this, but said, gruffly, 
 
"If you indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: desire|desire%2:37:00:: a heart, you must earn|earn%2:40:03:: it." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"Help Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Beast. "When the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, come|come%2:30:03:: to me, and I will then|then%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you 
the biggest|big%3:00:01:: and kindest|kind%3:00:00:: and most|most%4:02:00:: loving|loving%3:00:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:41:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: 
and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them of the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: seen. They all wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: at the many|many%3:00:00:: forms|form%1:09:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: could take|take%2:30:01:: upon himself, 
and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said, 
 
 
 
"If he is|be%2:42:03:: a beast|beast%1:03:00:: when I go|go%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: him, I shall roar|roar%1:10:00:: my loudest, and 
so|so%4:02:05:: frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: him that he will grant|grant%2:32:00:: all I|i%1:23:00:: ask. And if he is|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady, I shall pretend|pretend%2:32:01:: to spring|spring%2:38:01:: upon her, and so|so%4:02:05:: compel|compel%2:41:00:: her to do|do%2:36:01:: my 
bidding. And if he is|be%2:42:03:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Head, he will be|be%2:42:03:: at my mercy; for I 
will roll|roll%2:38:00:: this head|head%1:08:00:: all about the room|room%1:06:00:: until he promises|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: us 
what we desire. So|so%4:02:05:: be|be%2:42:03:: of good|good%3:00:01:: cheer|cheer%1:07:00:: my friends|friend%1:18:00:: for all will yet|yet%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
well." 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: to 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and bade|bid%2:32:00:: him enter|enter%2:38:00:: the presence|presence%1:15:00:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the door, and glancing|glance%2:39:00:: around saw, to 
his surprise, that before the throne|throne%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 
and glowing|glowing%3:00:00:enthusiastic:00 he could scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: to gaze|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it. His first|first%3:00:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: that Oz had|have%2:42:00:: by accident|accident%1:11:00:: caught|catch%2:30:00:: on fire|fire%1:22:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: burning|burn%2:30:01:: up; but, 
when he tried|try%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: nearer, the heat|heat%1:07:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: intense|intense%3:00:00:: that it singed|sing%2:32:08:: 
his whiskers, and he crept|creep%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: tremblingly to a spot|spot%1:15:01:: nearer the door. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: a low, quiet|quiet%3:00:00:soft:04 voice|voice%1:07:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: from the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, and these were|be%2:42:06:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: it spoke: 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:41:01:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: 
me?" And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of everything. I come|come%2:38:00:: to you to beg|beg%2:32:00:: 
that you give|give%2:40:03:: me courage, so that in reality|reality%1:26:01:: I may become|become%2:42:01:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of 
Beasts, as men|man%1:18:00:: call|call%2:32:02:: me." 
 
"Why should I give|give%2:40:03:: you courage?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because of all Wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: you are|be%2:42:06:: the greatest, and alone|alone%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: power|power%1:07:00:: to 
grant|grant%2:32:00:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
The Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: burned|burn%2:43:01:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: for a time, and the voice|voice%1:07:00:: said, 
 
"Bring me proof|proof%1:09:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, and that moment|moment%1:28:00:: I will 
give|give%2:40:03:: you courage. But so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: lives|live%2:42:04:: you must remain|remain%2:30:00:: a 
coward." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: at this speech, but could say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: in reply, 
and while he stood|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: gazing|gaze%2:39:00:: at the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: it became|become%2:42:01:: 
so|so%4:02:09:: furiously|furiously%4:02:01:: hot|hot%3:00:01:: that he turned|turn%2:38:00:: tail|tail%1:08:01:: and rushed|rush%2:38:01:: from the room. He 
was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:39:01:: his friends|friend%1:18:00:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for him, and told|tell%2:32:01:: them of his 
terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 interview|interview%1:10:01:: with the Wizard. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sadly. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:04:00:: we can do," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, "and that 
is|be%2:42:03:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Winkies, seek|seek%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, and 
destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: her." 
 
"But suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we cannot?" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Then I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: courage," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart," spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, 
beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to cry. 
 
"Be careful!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "the tears|tear%1:08:01:: will fall|fall%2:38:03:: on your 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, and spot|spot%1:10:01:: it." 
 
So Dorothy dried|dry%2:30:01:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we must try|try%2:41:01:: it; but I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I do|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
anybody, even|even%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:41:12:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again." 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: with you; but I'm too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a coward|coward%1:18:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: too," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: of much|much%3:00:00:: 
help|help%1:04:00:: to you, I am|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a fool." 
 
"I haven't the heart|heart%1:09:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: a Witch," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; 
"but if you go|go%2:38:01:: I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall go|go%2:38:00:: with you." 
 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to start|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
morning, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: sharpened|sharpen%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grindstone|grindstone%1:06:00:: and 
had|have%2:30:00:: all his joints|joint%1:08:00:: properly|properly%4:02:00:: oiled. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: himself with 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: straw|straw%1:27:00:: and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: new|new%3:00:00:: paint|paint%1:06:00:: on his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that he might see|see%2:39:00:: 
better. The green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind|kind%3:00:00:: to them, filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's 
basket|basket%1:06:00:: with good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat, and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: a little|little%3:00:01:: bell|bell%1:06:00:: around 
Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon. 
 
They went|go%2:38:00:: to bed|bed%1:06:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: early|early%3:00:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until daylight, when 
they were|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by the crowing|crowing%1:10:00:: of a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cock|cock%1:05:01:: that lived|live%2:42:08:: in the 
back|back%4:02:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: of the palace, and the cackling of a hen|hen%1:05:01:: that had|have%2:40:00:: laid|lay%2:35:02:: a

The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: of

"Which road|road%1:06:00:: leads|lead%2:38:01:: to the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no road," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates; "no one ever|ever%4:02:04::

"How, then, are|be%2:42:06:: we to find|find%2:40:00:: her?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
 
 
"That will be|be%2:42:03:: easy," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the man; "for when she knows|know%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: in

"Perhaps not," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for we mean|mean%2:31:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: her." 
 
 
 
"Oh, that is|be%2:42:03:: different," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates. "No one has|have%2:42:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:35:00:: her before, so I naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would make|make%2:41:00:: 
slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of you, as she has|have%2:40:00:: of all the rest. But take|take%2:41:04:: care; for she is|be%2:42:03:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: and fierce, and may not|not%4:02:00:: allow|allow%2:41:00:: you to destroy|destroy%2:33:00:: her. Keep|keep%2:42:00:: to the 
West, where the sun|sun%1:17:00:: sets, and you cannot fail|fail%2:41:02:: to find|find%2:40:00:: her." 
 
They thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him and bade|bid%2:32:01:: him good-bye, and turned|turn%2:38:00:: toward the West, 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: over fields|field%1:15:00:: of soft|soft%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: and there|there%4:02:00:: with daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: 
and buttercups. Dorothy still|still%4:02:01:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: the pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: dress|dress%1:06:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
put|put%2:35:05:: on|on%4:02:00:: in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found|find%2:40:02:: it was|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:01:: green, but pure|pure%3:00:04:: white. The ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: its green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's dress. 
 
The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: behind. As they advanced|advance%2:38:00:: the 
ground|ground%1:27:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: rougher|rough%3:00:00:: and hillier, for there were|be%2:42:00:: no farms|farm%1:06:00:: nor houses|house%1:06:00:: 
in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the West, and the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: untilled. 
 
In the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone hot|hot%3:00:01:: in their faces, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: to offer|offer%2:40:02:: them shade; so|so%4:02:06:: that before night|night%1:28:00:: Dorothy and Toto and 
the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tired, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, 
with the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: keeping|keep%2:31:00:: watch. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: but one eye, yet|yet%4:02:02:: that was|be%2:42:03:: as 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as a telescope, and could see|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. So, as she sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle, she happened|happen%2:30:02:: to look|look%2:39:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy 
lying|lie%2:42:03:: asleep, with her friends|friend%1:18:00:: all about her. They were|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:01:: 
distance|distance%1:12:00:: off, but the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: them in her 
country; so she blew|blow%2:39:05:: upon a silver|silver%1:27:00:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: that hung around her neck. 
 
At once|once%4:02:02:: there came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: to her from all directions|direction%1:15:00:: a pack|pack%1:14:00:: of great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
wolves. They had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: and fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 teeth. 
 
"Go to those people," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, "and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to pieces." 
 
"Are you not|not%4:02:00:: going|go%2:41:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: them your slaves?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the 
wolves. 
 
"No," she answered, "one is|be%2:42:03:: of tin, and one of straw; one is|be%2:42:06:: a girl|girl%1:18:00:: 
and another a Lion. None|none%1:28:00:: of them is|be%2:42:03:: fit|fit%3:00:02:: to work, so you may tear|tear%2:35:01:: them 
into small|small%3:00:00:: pieces." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the wolf, and he dashed|dash%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 speed, 
followed|follow%2:38:00:: by the others. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: awake and heard|hear%2:31:00:: 
the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: coming. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my fight," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so get|get%2:30:00:: behind me and I will 
meet|meet%2:38:01:: them as they come." 
 
He seized|seize%2:35:00:: his axe, which he had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sharp, and as the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
of the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: on the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: his arm|arm%1:08:00:: and chopped|chop%2:35:03:: the 
wolf's head|head%2:42:04:: from its body, so that it immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: died. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he 
could raise|raise%2:38:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: another wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: up, and he also|also%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: under the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's weapon. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty wolves, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: a wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: killed; so that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: in a 
heap|heap%1:23:00:: before the Woodman. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he put|put%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and sat|sit%2:38:00:: beside the Scarecrow, who said, 
 
"It was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: fight, friend." 
 
They waited|wait%2:42:00:: until Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of shaggy wolves, but 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her all. She thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him for saving|save%2:41:01:: them and sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to breakfast, after which they started|start%2:30:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: upon their journey. 
 
 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: this same|same%3:00:02:: morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: with her one eye|eye%1:08:00:: that could see|see%2:39:00:: afar off. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: all 
her wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: dead, and the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: still|still%4:02:01:: travelling|travel%2:38:00:: through her 
country. This made|make%2:30:00:: her angrier|angry%3:00:00:stormy:00 than before, and she blew|blow%2:29:00:: her silver|silver%1:07:00:: 
whistle|whistle%2:32:00:: twice. 
 
Straightway a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: toward her, 
enough|enough%4:02:00:: to darken|darken%2:30:01:: the sky. And the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: to the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow, 
 
"Fly at once|once%4:02:00:: to the strangers; peck|peck%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to 
pieces." 
 
The wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: toward Dorothy and her 
companions. When the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: afraid. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my battle; so lie|lie%1:10:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside me and you will not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: harmed." 
 
So they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: upon the ground|ground%1:17:00:: except the Scarecrow, and he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: and stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his arms. And when the crows|crow%1:05:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: him they were|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened, as these birds|bird%1:05:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: by scarecrows, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:01:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: any nearer. But the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: said, 
 
"It is|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: man. I will peck|peck%2:35:01:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: out." 
 
The King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at the Scarecrow, who caught|catch%2:35:06:: it by the head|head%1:08:00:: and 
twisted|twist%2:35:02:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: until it died. And then|then%4:02:00:: another crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him, 
and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: also. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty crows, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: a neck, until at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 all were|be%2:42:03:: 
lying|lie%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: beside him. Then|then%4:02:00:: he called|call%2:32:09:: to his companions|companion%1:18:00:: to rise, and 
again|again%4:02:00:: they went|go%2:30:01:: upon their journey. 
 
When the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: all her crows|crow%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in 
a heap, she got|get%2:30:00:: into a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 rage, and blew|blow%2:29:00:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon her 
silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 whistle. 
 
 
 
Forthwith there|there%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 buzzing|buzz%2:42:00:: in the air, and a swarm|swarm%1:14:00:: 
of black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: towards her. "Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and 
sting|sting%2:39:00:: them to death!" commanded|command%2:32:00:: the Witch, and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
walking. But the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
decided|decide%2:31:00:: what to do. 
 
"Take out|out%4:02:04:: my straw|straw%1:27:00:: and scatter|scatter%2:35:00:: it over the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
and the lion," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Woodman, "and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot sting|sting%1:26:01:: 
them." This the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: did, and as Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: covered|cover%2:35:01:: them entirely. 
 
The bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: no one|one%1:23:00:: but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to sting, so they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him and broke|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: all their stings|sting%1:26:00:: against the tin, without 
hurting|hurt%2:39:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: at all. And as bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot live|live%4:02:00:: when their stings|sting%1:26:01:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of the black|black%3:00:01:: bees, and they lay|lay%2:35:00:: scattered|scatter%2:30:00:: 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 about the Woodman, like little|little%3:00:01:: heaps|heap%1:23:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: up, and the girl|girl%1:18:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
put|put%2:35:00:: the straw|straw%1:27:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: again, until he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as 
ever. So they started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: once more. 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: her black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: in little|little%3:00:00:young:00 
heaps|heap%1:14:00:: like fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal|coal%1:27:00:: that she stamped|stamp%2:38:00:: her foot|foot%1:08:01:: and tore|tear%2:35:00:: her hair|hair%1:08:00:: and 
gnashed|gnash%2:29:00:: her teeth. And then|then%4:02:00:: she called|call%2:32:05:: a dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of her slaves, who 
were|be%2:42:06:: the Winkies, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 spears, telling|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: them. 
 
The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: people, but they had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: 
told; so they marched|march%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: near to Dorothy. Then|then%4:02:00:: the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:32:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar|roar%1:10:00:: and sprang|spring%2:38:01:: toward them, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Winkies 
were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 that they ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could. 
 
When they returned|return%2:38:00:: to the castle|castle%1:06:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: beat|beat%2:33:00:: them well|well%4:02:03:: 
with a strap, and sent|send%2:38:01:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to their work, after which she sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: what she should do|do%2:41:01:: next. She could not|not%4:02:00:: understand|understand%2:31:00:: how 
all her plans|plan%1:09:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: these strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: failed; but she was|be%2:42:03:: a 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: Witch, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 one, and she soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her 
mind|mind%2:31:02:: how to act. 
 
 
 
There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle|circle%1:25:00:: of diamonds|diamond%1:21:00:: and 
rubies|ruby%1:27:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: round|round%3:00:00:: it. This Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: a charm. Whoever owned|own%2:40:00:: 
it could call|call%2:32:05:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, who would obey|obey%2:41:00:: 
any order|order%1:10:03:: they were|be%2:42:03:: given. But no person|person%1:03:00:: could command|command%2:32:01:: these strange|strange%3:00:00:: 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than three times. Twice|twice%4:02:00:: already|already%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
used|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Cap. Once|once%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: the Winkies her 
slaves, and set|set%2:30:01:: herself to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over|over%4:02:02:: their country. The Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. The second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: fought|fight%2:33:01:: against 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz himself, and driven|drive%2:35:11:: him out of the land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. The 
Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her in doing|do%2:41:01:: this. Only|only%4:02:01:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: could 
she use|use%2:34:01:: this Golden Cap, for which reason|reason%1:16:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to do|do%2:36:01:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
until all her other|other%3:00:00:: powers|power%1:09:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: exhausted. But now|now%4:02:05:: that her fierce|fierce%3:00:00:stormy:00 
wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: and her wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and her stinging|stinging%3:00:00:unkind:00 bees|bee%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gone, and her 
slaves|slave%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: scared|scar%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: by the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, she saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: one way|way%1:04:01:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: Dorothy and her friends. 
 
 
 
So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: took|take%2:30:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: from her cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: 
it upon her head. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her left|leave%2:38:01:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, slowly, "Ep-pe, pep-pe, 
kak-ke!" 
 
Next|next%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her right|right%3:00:00:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" 
 
After this she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon both feet|foot%1:08:01:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice, 
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to work. The sky|sky%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: darkened, and a low|low%3:00:01:: 
rumbling|rumble%2:39:00:: sound|sound%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: in the air. There was|be%2:42:04:: a rushing|rush%2:30:00:: of many|many%3:00:00:: 
wings; a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and laughing; and the sun|sun%1:17:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: out of the 
dark|dark%3:00:02:: sky|sky%1:17:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: by a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: of monkeys, 
each with a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of immense|immense%3:00:01:large:00 and powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: wings|wing%1:05:00:: on his shoulders. 
 
One, much|much%4:02:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the others, seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: their leader. He flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
close|close%4:02:01:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and said, 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:05:: us for the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 and last|last%3:00:00:: time. What do|do%2:41:01:: you command?" 
 
"Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: who are|be%2:42:05:: within my land|land%1:15:01:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:00:: them all 
except the Lion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch. "Bring that beast|beast%1:03:00:: to me, for 
I have|have%2:40:00:: a mind|mind%1:09:00:: to harness|harness%1:06:00:: him like a horse, and make|make%2:32:00:: him work." 
 
"Your commands|command%1:10:00:: shall be|be%2:42:03:: obeyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the leader; and then, with a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and noise, the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to 
the place|place%1:15:00:: where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: walking. 
 
 
 
Some of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: over a country|country%1:15:02:: thickly|thickly%4:02:01:: covered|cover%2:42:01:: with sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
rocks. Here|here%4:02:00:: they dropped|drop%2:38:01:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Woodman, who fell|fall%2:38:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
to the rocks, where he lay|lay%2:35:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: battered|batter%2:35:01:: and dented|dent%2:35:00:: that he could 
neither move|move%1:04:03:: nor groan. 
 
Others of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow, and with their long|long%3:00:01:: 
fingers|finger%1:23:01:: pulled|pull%2:35:00:: all of the straw|straw%1:27:00:: out of his clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and head. They 
made|make%2:30:15:: his hat|hat%1:06:00:: and boots|boot%1:06:00:: and clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: into a small|small%3:00:00:: bundle|bundle%1:06:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:07:: it 
into the top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: of a tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree. 
 
The remaining|remain%2:42:03:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: threw|throw%2:35:00:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of stout|stout%1:13:00:: rope|rope%1:06:00:: around the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and wound|wind%2:35:06:: many|many%3:00:00:: coils|coil%1:25:00:: about his body|body%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: and legs, until he was|be%2:42:03:: 
unable|unable%3:00:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: or scratch|scratch%2:35:00:: or struggle|struggle%2:35:00:: in any way. Then|then%4:02:00:: they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: with him to the Witch's castle, where he was|be%2:42:03:: 
placed|place%2:40:00:: in a small|small%3:00:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: with a high|high%3:00:02:: iron|iron%1:27:00:: fence|fence%1:06:00:: around it, so that he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: escape. 
 
But Dorothy they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: at all. She stood, with Toto in her 
arms, watching|watch%2:39:02:: the sad|sad%3:00:00:: fate|fate%1:11:00:: of her comrades|comrade%1:18:00:: and thinking|think%2:31:03:: it would 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:06:: her turn. The leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her, 
his long, hairy|hairy%3:00:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and his ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: grinning|grin%2:29:00:: 
terribly; but he saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the Good|good%1:07:00:: Witch's kiss|kiss%1:04:00:: upon her 
forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: and stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, motioning|motion%2:32:00:: the others not|not%4:02:00:: to touch|touch%2:35:00:: her. 
 
 
 
"We dare not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: this little|little%3:00:01:: girl," he said|say%2:32:00:: to them, "for she is|be%2:42:06:: 
protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the Power|power%1:07:00:: of Good, and that is|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:large:00 than the Power|power%1:07:00:: 
of Evil. All we can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: her to the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch|witch%1:18:03:: and leave|leave%2:31:05:: her there." 
 
So, carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and gently, they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: her swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the castle, 
where they set|set%2:35:00:: her down|down%4:02:00:: upon the front|front%3:00:00:: door|door%1:06:01:: step. Then|then%4:02:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: obeyed|obey%2:41:00:: you as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as we were|be%2:42:03:: able. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: destroyed, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in your yard. The 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: we dare|dare%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm, nor the dog|dog%1:05:00:: she carries|carry%2:35:02:: in her arms. Your 
power|power%1:07:00:: over our band|band%1:14:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: ended, and you will never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: us again." 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: all the Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys, with much|much%3:00:00:: laughing and chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and 
noise, flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: both surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: and worried|worry%2:37:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: 
on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: well|well%4:02:00:: that neither the Winged 
Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: nor she, herself, dare hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: in any way. She looked|look%2:39:00:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: at Dorothy's feet, and seeing|see%2:39:00:: the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes, began|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble|tremble%2:38:00:: 
with fear, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: what a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm|charm%1:06:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to them. At 
first|first%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: tempted|tempt%2:32:01:: to run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Dorothy; but she happened|happen%2:30:02:: 
to look|look%2:39:00:: into the child's eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: how simple|simple%3:00:02:: the soul|soul%1:18:00:: behind them 
was, and that the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: gave|give%2:40:03:: her. So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: to herself, and 
thought, "I can still|still%4:02:01:: make|make%2:30:00:: her my slave, for she does|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: how to 
use|use%2:34:01:: her power." Then|then%4:02:00:: she said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, harshly|harshly%4:02:02:: and severely, 
 
"Come with me; and see|see%2:31:03:: that you mind|mind%2:31:02:: everything I tell|tell%2:32:04:: you, for if 
you do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: I will make|make%2:30:00:: an end|end%1:28:00:: of you, as I did|do%2:41:01:: of the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and 
the Scarecrow." 
 
Dorothy followed|follow%2:38:00:: her through many|many%3:00:00:: of the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: in her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the kitchen, where the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: bade|bid%2:32:00:: her clean|clean%2:35:00:: the pots|pot%1:06:00:: 
and kettles|kettle%1:06:00:: and sweep|sweep%1:18:00:: the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the fire|fire%1:22:00:: fed|fed%1:18:00:: with wood. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:41:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: meekly, with her mind|mind%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as 
she could; for she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
her. 
 
With Dorothy hard|hard%4:02:00:: at work|work%1:04:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:41:00:: into the 
court-yard and harness|harness%1:06:00:: the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: like a horse; it would amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: 
her, she was|be%2:42:03:: sure, to make|make%2:32:00:: him draw|draw%2:35:03:: her chariot|chariot%1:06:00:: whenever she wished|wish%2:37:02:: 
to go|go%2:38:00:: to drive. But as she opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar|roar%1:11:01:: 
and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: at her so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and shut|shut%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: again. 
 
"If I cannot harness|harness%1:06:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: to the Lion, speaking|speaking%1:10:01:: 
through the bars|bar%1:06:00:: of the gate, "I can starve|starve%2:34:03:: you. You shall have|have%2:40:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: until you do|do%2:41:01:: as I wish." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: after that she took|take%2:38:10:: no food|food%1:03:00:: to the imprisoned|imprison%2:41:00:: Lion; but every day|day%1:28:00:: 
she came|come%2:38:04:: to the gate|gate%1:06:00:: at noon|noon%1:28:00:: and asked, 
 
"Are you ready|ready%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: like a horse?" 
 
And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would answer, 
 
"No. If you come|come%2:38:00:: in this yard|yard%1:06:02:: I will bite|bite%2:35:00:: you." 
 
The reason|reason%1:10:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: wished|wish%2:37:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
every night, while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: him food|food%1:03:00:: from 
the cupboard. After he had|have%2:34:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: he would lie|lie%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his bed|bed%1:06:00:: of straw, 
and Dorothy would lie|lie%2:35:00:: beside him and put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: on his soft, shaggy 
mane, while they talked|talk%2:32:01:: of their troubles|trouble%1:09:00:: and tried|try%2:41:00:: to plan|plan%2:31:00:: some way|way%1:04:01:: to 
escape. But they could find|find%2:36:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the castle, for it was|be%2:42:06:: 
constantly|constantly%4:02:01:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: by the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, who were|be%2:42:03:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and too|too%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her not|not%4:02:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as she told|tell%2:32:02:: them. 
 
The girl|girl%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during the day, and often|often%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
threatened|threaten%2:32:00:: to beat|beat%2:35:01:: her with the same|same%3:00:02:: old|old%3:00:01:: umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: she always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: in 
her hand. But, in truth, she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: to strike|strike%2:35:00:: Dorothy, because of 
the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon her forehead. The child|child%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, and was|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: 
of fear|fear%1:12:00:: for herself and Toto. Once|once%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: struck|strike%2:35:00:: Toto a blow|blow%1:04:01:: with 
her umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: and the brave|brave%2:42:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at her and bit|bite%2:35:00:: her leg, in 
return. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: bleed|bleed%2:29:00:: where she was|be%2:42:03:: bitten, for she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: that the blood|blood%1:08:00:: in her had|have%2:40:00:: dried|dry%2:30:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: before. 
 
Dorothy's life|life%1:26:02:: became|become%2:30:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: as she grew|grow%2:30:03:: to understand|understand%2:31:01:: that it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again. 
Sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: she would cry|cry%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: for hours, with Toto sitting|sit%2:42:00:: at her 
feet|foot%1:08:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: into her face, whining|whine%2:32:00:: dismally|dismally%4:02:01:: to show|show%2:39:00:: how sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: he 
was|be%2:42:06:: for his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether he was|be%2:42:03:: 
in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: or the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: with him; but he 
knew|know%2:31:01:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: unhappy, and that made|make%2:30:00:: him unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: too. 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 longing|longing%1:12:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: for her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: which the girl|girl%1:18:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: wore. Her Bees|bee%1:05:00:: and her Crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
her Wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in heaps|heap%1:14:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:00:: up, and she had|have%2:40:01:: used|use%2:34:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
all the power|power%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap; but if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:40:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: they would give|give%2:40:03:: her more|more%3:00:01:: power|power%1:07:00:: than all the other|other%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:09:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost. She watched|watch%2:41:00:: Dorothy carefully, to see|see%2:32:00:: if she 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: her shoes, thinking|think%2:31:03:: she might steal|steal%2:40:00:: them. But the child|child%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that she never|never%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: except 
at night|night%1:28:00:: and when she took|take%2:39:00:: her bath. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
of the dark|dark%1:26:00:: to dare|dare%2:41:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: in Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: at night|night%1:28:00:: to take|take%2:40:01:: the shoes, 
and her dread|dread%1:12:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 than her fear|fear%1:12:00:: of the dark, so she 
never|never%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: bathing. Indeed, the old|old%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: never|never%4:02:01:: 
touched|touch%2:39:00:: water, nor ever|ever%4:02:04:: let|let%2:41:00:: water|water%1:27:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: her in any way. 
 
But the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature|creature%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: cunning, and she finally|finally%4:02:02:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of 
a trick|trick%1:04:04:: that would give|give%2:40:03:: her what she wanted. She placed|place%2:35:00:: a bar|bar%1:06:00:: of iron|iron%1:27:00:: 
in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor, and then|then%4:02:00:: by her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:12:: 
the iron|iron%1:27:00:: invisible|invisible%3:00:04:: to human|human%3:01:01:: eyes. So that when Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: across 
the floor|floor%1:06:00:: she stumbled|stumble%2:38:00:: over the bar, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: it, and 
fell|fall%2:38:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length. She was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: hurt, but in her fall|fall%1:04:01:: one of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: off, and before she could reach|reach%2:42:00:: it the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
had|have%2:42:00:: snatched|snatch%2:35:00:: it away|away%4:02:01:: and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 skinny|skinny%3:00:00:thin:03 foot. 
 
The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with the success|success%1:26:00:: of her trick, 
for as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: one of the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: she owned|own%2:40:00:: half the power|power%1:07:00:: of 
their charm, and Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: use|use%2:34:01:: it against her, even|even%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: she 
known|know%2:31:01:: how to do|do%2:41:01:: so. 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, seeing|see%2:31:01:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: one of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes, grew|grow%2:30:00:: 
angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"Give me back|back%2:38:01:: my shoe!" 
 
"I will not," retorted|retort%2:32:00:: the Witch, "for it is|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: my shoe, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
yours." 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: to 
take|take%2:40:00:: my shoe|shoe%1:06:00:: from me." 
 
"I shall keep|keep%2:40:00:: it, just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, laughing at her, 
"and some day|day%1:28:00:: I shall get|get%2:40:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one from you, too." 
 
This made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy so|so%4:02:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: that she picked|pick%2:40:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of 
water|water%1:27:00:: that stood|stand%2:35:00:: near and dashed|dash%2:35:02:: it over the Witch, wetting|wet%2:30:00:: her from 
head|head%1:08:00:: to foot. 
 
Instantly|instantly%4:02:02:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fear; and then, as 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at her in wonder, the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to shrink|shrink%2:30:01:: and fall|fall%2:38:00:: 
away. 
 
"See what you have|have%2:40:00:: done!" she screamed. "In a minute|minute%1:28:00:: I shall melt|melt%2:30:01:: 
away." 
 
"I'm very|very%4:02:00:: sorry, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 to 
see|see%2:39:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: actually|actually%4:02:00:: melting|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: like brown|brown%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sugar|sugar%1:13:00:: before her very|very%4:02:00:: 
eyes. 
 
"Didn't you know|know%2:31:01:: water|water%1:27:00:: would be|be%2:42:03:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Witch, in a 
wailing, despairing voice. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: not," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "how should I?" 
 
"Well, in a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all melted, and you will have|have%2:40:00:: the 
castle|castle%1:06:02:: to yourself. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: in my day, but I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: 
a little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: like you would ever|ever%4:02:04:: be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to melt|melt%2:30:01:: me and end|end%2:30:01:: my 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: deeds. Look|look%1:04:00:: out--here I go!" 
 
With these words|word%1:10:03:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in a brown, melted, shapeless|shapeless%3:00:00:unformed:00 
mass|mass%1:17:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to spread|spread%2:38:02:: over the clean|clean%3:00:01:: boards|board%1:27:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor. 
Seeing|see%2:39:00:: that she had|have%2:40:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: to nothing, Dorothy drew|draw%2:38:02:: 
another bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:00:: it over the mess. She then|then%4:02:00:: swept|sweep%2:42:00:: 
it all out|out%4:02:04:: the door. After picking|pick%2:31:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoe, which was|be%2:42:03:: 
all that was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: of the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she cleaned|clean%2:35:00:: and dried|dry%2:30:01:: it with a 
cloth, and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her foot|foot%1:08:01:: again. Then, being|be%2:42:03:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 free|free%3:00:00:: to do|do%2:36:01:: 
as she chose, she ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to the court-yard to tell|tell%2:32:04:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: that the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:30:03:: to an end, and that they were|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:02:: prisoners|prisoner%1:18:00:: in a strange|strange%3:00:01:: land. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIII. 
 
 
The Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:31:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: by a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water, and Dorothy at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: 
the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of his prison|prison%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: him free. They went|go%2:38:00:: in together|together%4:02:00:: to 
the castle, where Dorothy's first|first%4:02:00:: act|act%2:36:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: to call|call%2:32:05:: all the Winkies 
together|together%4:02:01:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them that they were|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: longer|long%3:00:02:: slaves. 
 
There was|be%2:42:03:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 rejoicing|rejoice%2:37:00:: among the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, for they had|have%2:40:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:32:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: for the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, who 
had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them with great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 cruelty. They kept|keep%2:41:05:: this day|day%1:28:00:: as 
a holiday, then|then%4:02:01:: and ever|ever%4:02:05:: after, and spent|spend%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: in feasting|feast%2:34:00:: and 
dancing. 
 
"If our friends, the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, were|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: with 
us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"Don't you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we could rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"We can try," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they called|call%2:32:01:: the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies and asked|ask%2:32:00:: them if they would help|help%2:41:00:: 
to rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: their friends, and the Winkies said|say%2:32:00:: that they would be|be%2:42:03:: 
delighted|delighted%3:00:00:pleased:00 to do|do%2:41:01:: all in their power|power%1:07:02:: for Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: 
from bondage. So she chose|choose%2:31:00:: a number|number%1:07:00:: of the Winkies who looked|look%2:39:01:: as if 
they knew|know%2:31:00:: the most, and they all started|start%2:38:02:: away. They travelled|travel%2:38:00:: that 
day|day%1:28:00:: and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the rocky|rocky%3:00:00:rough:00 plain|plain%1:17:00:: where the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman lay, all battered|batter%2:35:01:: and bent. His axe|axe%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: near him, but the 
blade|blade%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: and the handle|handle%2:35:01:: broken|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: short. 
 
The Winkies lifted|lift%2:38:00:: him tenderly|tenderly%4:02:00:: in their arms, and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him back|back%4:02:04:: 
to the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 castle|castle%1:06:02:: again, Dorothy shedding|shed%2:35:02:: a few|few%3:00:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: by the way|way%1:15:00:: 
at the sad|sad%3:00:00:: plight|plight%1:26:00:: of her old|old%3:00:02:: friend, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: looking|look%2:39:01:: sober|sober%3:00:01:: and 
sorry. When they reached|reach%2:38:01:: the castle|castle%1:06:00:: Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: to the Winkies, 
 
"Are any of your people|people%1:14:02:: tinsmiths?" 
 
"Oh, yes; some of us are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: tinsmiths," they told|tell%2:32:04:: her. 
 
"Then bring|bring%2:35:00:: them to me," she said. And when the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: came, 
bringing|bring%2:38:00:: with them all their tools|tool%1:06:00:: in baskets, she enquired, 
 
[Illustration: "_The Tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four 
nights._"] 
 
"Can you straighten|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: those dents|dent%1:25:00:: in the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, and bend|bend%1:25:01:: 
him back|back%4:02:05:: into shape|shape%1:08:00:: again, and solder|solder%1:27:00:: him together|together%4:02:02:: where he is|be%2:42:05:: 
broken?" 
 
The tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: over carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:00:: answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
that they thought|think%2:31:03:: they could mend|mend%2:30:00:: him so he would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:00:: in one of the big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: of the castle|castle%1:06:00:: and 
worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four nights, hammering|hammer%2:35:00:: and twisting|twist%2:35:02:: and 
bending|bend%2:35:08:: and soldering and polishing|polish%2:35:00:: and pounding|pound%2:35:00:: at the legs|leg%1:08:01:: and body|body%1:08:00:: 
and head|head%1:08:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, until at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: straightened|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into 
his old|old%3:00:01:: form, and his joints|joint%1:08:00:: worked|work%2:35:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, there 
were|be%2:42:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 patches|patch%1:07:00:: on him, but the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: a good|good%3:00:01:: job, and as 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a vain|vain%3:00:00:proud:00 man|man%1:18:00:: he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: the patches|patch%1:06:00:: at all. 
 
When, at last, he walked|walk%2:38:00:: into Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her for 
rescuing|rescue%2:41:00:: him, he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: that he wept|weep%2:29:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: of joy, and 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: every tear|tear%2:29:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: from his face|face%1:08:00:: with her 
apron, so his joints|joint%1:08:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: rusted. At the same|same%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
tears|tear%1:08:01:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 and fast|fast%3:00:01:: at the joy|joy%1:12:00:: of meeting|meet%2:41:01:: her old|old%3:00:03:past:00 friend|friend%1:18:00:: again, 
and these tears|tear%1:08:01:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: need|need%2:34:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: away. As for the Lion, he 
wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: with the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of his tail|tail%1:05:00:: that it became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: 
wet, and he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into the court-yard and hold|hold%2:35:00:: it in 
the sun|sun%1:19:00:: till it dried. 
 
"If we only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: with us again," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
when Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: telling|tell%2:32:01:: him everything that had|have%2:40:00:: happened, 
"I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"We must try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: she called|call%2:32:05:: the Winkies to help|help%2:41:00:: her, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: all that day|day%1:28:00:: 
and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
of which the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: tossed|toss%2:35:04:: the Scarecrow's clothes. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree, and the trunk|trunk%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: that no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could climb|climb%2:38:00:: it; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: at once, 
 
"I'll chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, and then|then%4:02:00:: we can get|get%2:35:03:: the Scarecrow's clothes." 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: while the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: at work|work%1:04:00:: mending|mend%2:30:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: himself, 
another of the Winkies, who was|be%2:41:00:: a goldsmith, had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:01:: an axe-handle 
of solid|solid%3:00:00:homogeneous:00 gold|gold%1:27:00:: and fitted|fit%2:40:00:: it to the Woodman's axe, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the 
old|old%3:00:01:: broken|broken%3:00:01:: handle. Others polished|polish%2:35:00:: the blade|blade%1:06:00:: until all the rust|rust%1:22:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
removed|remove%2:30:00:: and it glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: like burnished|burnish%2:35:00:: silver. 
 
As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: spoken, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop, and in a 
short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:15:: over|over%4:02:01:: with a crash, when the Scarecrow's 
clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: out of the branches|branch%1:20:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: on the ground. 
 
Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: them up|up%4:02:00:: and had|have%2:32:00:: the Winkies carry|carry%2:35:02:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to the 
castle, where they were|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: with nice, clean|clean%3:00:01:: straw; and, behold! 
here|here%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever, thanking|thank%2:32:00:: them over and over 
again|again%4:02:00:: for saving|save%2:41:01:: him. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: reunited, Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: spent|spend%2:42:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
at the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Castle, where they found|find%2:40:02:: everything they needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
them comfortable. But one day|day%1:28:03:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: of Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, and said, 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Oz, and claim|claim%2:40:00:: his promise." 
 
"Yes," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, "at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my heart." 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, joyfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clapping|clap%2:29:00:: her hands. 
"Oh, let|let%2:41:00:: us start|start%2:30:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to-morrow!" 
 
 
 
This they decided|decide%2:31:00:: to do. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 day|day%1:28:00:: they called|call%2:41:00:: the Winkies together|together%4:02:01:: 
and bade|bid%2:32:01:: them good-bye. The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to have|have%2:30:00:: them go, and 
they had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: that they begged|beg%2:32:00:: him to stay|stay%2:42:01:: 
and rule|rule%1:26:00:: over them and the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Land|land%1:15:01:: of the West. Finding|finding%1:04:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: 
determined|determine%2:31:00:: to go, the Winkies gave|give%2:40:00:: Toto and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: each a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 
collar; and to Dorothy they presented|present%2:40:01:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: bracelet, studded|stud%2:42:00:: 
with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they gave|give%2:40:00:: a gold-headed walking|walking%1:04:00:: 
stick, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: him from stumbling; and to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: they offered|offer%2:40:02:: 
a silver|silver%1:27:00:: oil-can, inlaid with gold|gold%1:27:00:: and set|set%2:35:02:: with precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 jewels. 
 
Every one of the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: the Winkies a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 speech|speech%1:10:01:: in 
return, and all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with them until their arms|arm%1:08:00:: ached. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to the Witch's cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: with food|food%1:03:00:: for 
the journey, and there she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Golden Cap. She tried|try%2:41:01:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
head|head%1:08:00:: and found|find%2:31:09:: that it fitted|fit%2:30:01:: her exactly. She did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: anything 
about the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap, but she saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: pretty, so|so%4:02:09:: 
she made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: to wear|wear%2:29:00:: it and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: in the basket. 
 
Then, being|be%2:42:03:: prepared|prepare%2:30:00:: for the journey, they all started|start%2:38:02:: for the 
Emerald City; and the Winkies gave|give%2:40:07:: them three cheers|cheer%1:10:00:: and many|many%3:00:00:: good|good%3:00:00:fortunate:00 
wishes|wish%1:09:00:: to carry|carry%2:42:01:: with them. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIV. 
 
 
You will remember|remember%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: no road--not even|even%4:02:00:: a pathway--between 
the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. When the four 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in search|search%1:04:00:: of the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: sent|send%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to bring|bring%2:38:00:: them to her. It was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: harder|hard%3:00:06:: 
to find|find%2:36:00:: their way|way%1:15:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: through the big|big%3:00:01:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of buttercups|buttercup%1:20:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: than it was|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: carried. They knew, of course, they 
must go|go%2:38:00:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: east, toward the rising|rise%2:38:08:: sun; and they started|start%2:38:02:: off|off%4:02:03:: 
in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 way. But at noon, when the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: over their heads, 
they did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: which was|be%2:42:03:: east|east%3:00:00:: and which was|be%2:42:03:: west, and that was|be%2:42:06:: 
the reason|reason%1:16:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: lost|lose%2:39:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 fields. They kept|keep%2:42:07:: on walking, 
however, and at night|night%1:28:00:: the moon|moon%1:17:01:: came|come%2:30:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and shone brightly. So they 
lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: among the sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 smelling|smell%2:39:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: 
until morning--all but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: behind a cloud, but they started|start%2:30:00:: on, as 
if they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: which way|way%1:15:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: going. 
 
"If we walk|walk%2:38:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: enough," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "we shall sometime|sometime%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to 
some place, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure." 
 
But day|day%1:28:00:: by day|day%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:38:03:: away, and they still|still%4:02:01:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: before them 
but the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to grumble|grumble%2:32:02:: a bit. 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," he said, "and unless we find|find%2:40:02:: it again|again%4:02:00:: 
in time|time%1:28:05:: to reach|reach%2:38:01:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: I shall never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:40:00:: my brains." 
 
"Nor I my heart," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me I can 
scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: wait|wait%2:31:00:: till I get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz, and you must admit|admit%2:32:00:: this is|be%2:42:06:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
long|long%3:00:02:: journey." 
 
"You see," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the 
courage|courage%1:07:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:07:: tramping|tramp%2:38:00:: forever, without getting|get%2:38:00:: anywhere|anywhere%4:02:00:: at all." 
 
 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy lost|lose%2:40:02:: heart. She sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her 
companions, and they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her, and Toto found|find%2:39:02:: that 
for the first|first%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: in his life|life%1:28:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: to chase|chase%2:38:00:: a butterfly|butterfly%1:05:00:: 
that flew|fly%2:38:00:: past his head; so he put|put%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his tongue|tongue%1:08:00:: and panted|pant%2:32:00:: and 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy as if to ask|ask%2:32:00:: what they should do|do%2:41:01:: next. 
 
"Suppose we call|call%2:32:01:: the Field|field%1:15:01:: Mice," she suggested. "They could probably|probably%4:02:00:: 
tell|tell%2:32:00:: us the way|way%1:04:01:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they could," cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow; "why didn't we think|think%2:31:00:: of 
that before?" 
 
Dorothy blew|blow%2:29:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: she had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: about her neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
since the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: it to her. In a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
they heard|hear%2:39:00:: the pattering of tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 feet, and many|many%3:00:00:: of the small|small%3:00:00:: grey|grey%3:00:00:achromatic:00 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her. Among them was|be%2:42:06:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: herself, who 
asked, in her squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for my friends?" 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. "Can you tell|tell%2:32:00:: us where the 
Emerald|emerald%1:21:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is?" 
 
 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Queen; "but it is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 way|way%1:04:02:: off, for you 
have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: it at your backs|back%1:08:00:: all this time." Then|then%4:02:00:: she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: Dorothy's 
Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Cap, and 
call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to you? They will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Oz 
in less|less%3:00:00:: than an hour." 
 
"I didn't know|know%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: a charm," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in surprise. 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: written|write%2:36:02:: inside the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice; 
"but if you are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: we must run|run%2:38:00:: away, 
for they are|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: and think|think%2:31:01:: it great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fun|fun%1:04:00:: to plague|plague%2:37:00:: us." 
 
"Won't they hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"Oh, no; they must obey|obey%2:41:00:: the wearer|wearer%1:18:00:: of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: out of sight, with all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: hurrying|hurry%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: inside the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: some words|word%1:10:00:: written|write%2:36:01:: upon 
the lining. These, she thought, must be|be%2:42:06:: the charm, so she read|read%2:31:00:: the 
directions|direction%1:04:01:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and put|put%2:35:00:: the Cap|cap%1:06:00:: upon her head. 
 
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing|stand%2:35:00:: on her left|left%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"What did|do%2:41:01:: you say?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what she 
was|be%2:42:03:: doing. 
 
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: on, standing|standing%1:26:00:: this time|time%1:11:00:: on her 
right|right%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"Hello!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, calmly. 
 
[Illustration: "_The Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00::

"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: on both 
feet. This ended|end%2:42:01:: the saying|saying%1:10:00:: of the charm, and they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
chattering|chatter%2:32:02:: and flapping|flap%2:38:03:: of wings, as the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to them. The King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy, and asked, 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: your command?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: the child, "and we have|have%2:40:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way." 
 
"We will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the King, and no sooner|sooner%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: he spoken|speak%2:32:00:: 
than two of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
with her. Others took|take%2:38:09:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and 
one little|little%3:00:00:young:00 Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: Toto and flew|fly%2:38:00:: after them, although the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
tried|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at first, 
for they remembered|remember%2:31:00:: how badly|badly%4:02:02:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:39:06:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them 
before; but they saw|saw%2:35:00:: that no harm|harm%1:26:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: intended, so they rode|ride%2:38:01:: through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: cheerfully, and had|have%2:39:06:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 time|time%1:11:01:: looking|look%2:39:00:: at the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
gardens|garden%1:06:00:: and woods|wood%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:02:: below them. 
 
Dorothy found|find%2:39:01:: herself riding|rid%2:40:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: between two of the biggest|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
Monkeys, one of them the King|king%1:18:00:: himself. They had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: of their 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: her. 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you have|have%2:40:00:: to obey|obey%2:41:00:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Golden Cap?" she asked. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: a long|long%3:00:02:: story," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the King, with a laugh; "but as we 
have|have%2:40:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: before us I will pass|pass%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: by telling|tell%2:32:00:: you 
about it, if you wish." 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: it," she replied. 
 
"Once," began|begin%2:30:00:: the leader, "we were|be%2:42:03:: a free|free%3:00:00:: people, living|live%2:42:06:: happily|happily%4:02:01:: in 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, flying|fly%2:38:00:: from tree|tree%1:20:00:: to tree, eating nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and fruit, 
and doing|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we pleased|please%2:37:01:: without calling|call%2:32:02:: anybody master. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: 
some of us were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: too|too%4:02:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: at times, flying|fly%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to 
pull|pull%2:35:00:: the tails|tail%1:05:00:: of the animals|animal%1:03:00:: that had|have%2:40:04:: no wings, chasing|chase%2:38:00:: birds, and 
throwing|throw%2:36:02:: nuts|nut%1:20:00:: at the people|people%1:14:00:: who walked|walk%2:38:00:: in the forest. But we were|be%2:42:03:: 
careless|careless%3:00:00:artless:00 and happy|happy%3:00:00:: and full|full%3:00:00:: of fun, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: every minute|minute%1:28:00:: of the 
day. This was|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, long|long%4:02:00:: before Oz came|come%2:38:04:: out of the clouds|cloud%1:17:00:: 
to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over this land. 
 
"There lived|live%2:42:08:: here|here%4:02:00:: then, away|away%4:02:00:: at the North, a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: princess, who 
was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: sorceress. All her magic|magic%1:09:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: the 
people, and she was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:02:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: anyone who was|be%2:42:03:: good. Her name|name%1:26:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: Gayelette, and she lived|live%2:42:08:: in a handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 palace|palace%1:06:01:: built|build%2:36:00:: from great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
blocks|block%1:25:01:: of ruby. Everyone loved|love%2:37:00:: her, but her greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
she could find|find%2:40:01:: no one|one%1:23:00:: to love|love%2:37:01:: in return, since all the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
too|too%4:02:00:: stupid|stupid%3:00:00:: and ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: to mate|mate%2:35:00:: with one so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and wise. At last, 
however, she found|find%2:40:02:: a boy|boy%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 and manly|manly%3:00:00:: and wise|wise%3:00:00:: beyond 
his years. Gayelette made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: that when he grew|grow%2:30:04:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
she would make|make%2:30:00:: him her husband, so she took|take%2:38:09:: him to her ruby|ruby%1:27:00:: palace|palace%1:14:00:: 
and used|use%2:34:01:: all her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: him as strong|strong%3:00:00:: and good|good%3:00:01:: and 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 as any woman|woman%1:18:00:: could wish. When he grew|grow%2:30:03:: to manhood, Quelala, 
as he was|be%2:42:03:: called, was|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: the best|best%3:00:00:: and wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the 
land, while his manly|manly%3:00:00:: beauty|beauty%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 that Gayelette loved|love%2:37:00:: him 
dearly, and hastened|hasten%2:30:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: everything ready|ready%3:00:00:: for the wedding. 
 
"My grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: at that time|time%1:28:00:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: which 
lived|live%2:42:08:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: near Gayalette's palace, and the old|old%3:00:02:: fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: 
a joke|joke%1:10:00:: better|better%4:02:00:: than a good|good%3:00:01:: dinner. One day, just|just%4:02:01:: before the wedding, 
my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: with his band|band%1:14:00:: when he saw|saw%2:35:00:: Quelala 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: beside the river. He was|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a rich|rich%3:00:00:colorful:00 costume|costume%1:06:01:: of pink|pink%1:07:00:: 
silk|silk%1:06:00:: and purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 velvet, and my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: he would see|see%2:39:00:: what 
he could do. At his word|word%1:10:06:: the band|band%1:14:01:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and seized|seize%2:35:01:: Quelala, 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: him in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: until they were|be%2:42:05:: over the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the 
river, and then|then%4:02:00:: dropped|drop%2:38:01:: him into the water. 
 
"'Swim out, my fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fellow,'" cried|cry%2:32:01:: my grandfather, "'and see|see%2:32:00:: if the 
water|water%1:13:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: spotted|spot%2:35:00:: your clothes.'" Quelala was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
swim, and he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: in the least|least%3:00:00:: spoiled|spoil%2:41:01:: by all his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. He 
laughed, when he came|come%2:38:04:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the water, and swam in to shore. 
But when Gayelette came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to him she found|find%2:40:00:: his silks|silk%1:06:00:: and 
velvet|velvet%1:06:00:: all ruined|ruin%2:35:00:: by the river. 
 
 
 
"The princess|princess%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry, and she knew, of course, who did|do%2:41:01:: it. She 
had|have%2:30:00:: all the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: before her, and she said|say%2:32:00:: at first|first%3:00:00:: 
that their wings|wing%1:05:00:: should be|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: and they should be|be%2:42:03:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: as they had|have%2:40:00:: 
treated|treat%2:29:00:: Quelala, and dropped|drop%2:38:01:: in the river. But my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: pleaded|plead%2:32:03:: 
hard, for he knew|know%2:31:02:: the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: would drown|drown%2:30:00:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: with their wings|wing%1:05:00:: 
tied, and Quelala said|say%2:32:00:: a kind|kind%1:09:00:: word|word%1:10:03:: for them also; so|so%4:02:05:: that Gayelette 
finally|finally%4:02:00:: spared|spar%2:32:00:: them, on condition|condition%1:10:01:: that the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: should ever|ever%4:02:00:: 
after do|do%2:41:01:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the bidding|bidding%1:10:02:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap. This 
Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for a wedding|wedding%1:11:00:: present|present%3:00:02:: to Quelala, and it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to 
have|have%2:42:00:: cost|cost%2:42:01:: the princess|princess%1:18:00:: half her kingdom. Of course|course%1:14:00:: my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: and 
all the other|other%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to the condition, and that is|be%2:42:06:: 
how it happens|happen%2:30:00:: that we are|be%2:42:03:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the 
Golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Cap, whomsoever he may be." 
 
"And what became|become%2:42:01:: of them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:39:06:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: 
interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the story. 
 
"Quelala being|be%2:42:06:: the first|first%3:00:00:: owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Monkey, "he was|be%2:42:03:: the first|first%3:00:00:: to lay|lay%2:35:01:: his wishes|wish%1:12:00:: upon us. As his bride|bride%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: the sight|sight%1:09:00:: of us, he called|call%2:32:05:: us all to him in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: 
after he had|have%2:40:00:: married|marry%2:41:00:: her and ordered|order%2:32:01:: us to always|always%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:40:00:: where she 
could never|never%4:02:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on a Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkey, which we were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to 
do, for we were|be%2:42:03:: all afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her. 
 
"This was|be%2:42:06:: all we ever|ever%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: until the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: into the 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the West, who made|make%2:32:00:: us enslave|enslave%2:41:00:: the 
Winkies, and afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: drive|drive%2:35:00:: Oz himself out of the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: yours, and three times|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: the right|right%1:07:00:: to

As the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: his story|story%1:10:03:: Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the 
green, shining|shin%2:38:00:: walls|wall%1:17:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: before them. She wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
at the rapid|rapid%3:00:02:fast:01 flight|flight%1:04:01:: of the Monkeys, but was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03::

the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the City, the King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: away, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
"That was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: ride," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. 
 
"Yes, and a quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 way|way%1:04:01:: out of our troubles." replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "How 
lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 it was|be%2:42:06:: you brought|bring%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: that wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Cap!" 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XV. 
 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: 
and rang|ring%2:39:01:: the bell. After ringing|ring%2:39:01:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 times|time%1:11:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: opened|open%2:35:00:: by the

"What! are|be%2:42:06:: you back|back%4:02:04:: again?" he asked, in surprise. 
 
"Do you not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: us?" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:03:: you had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: to visit|visit%2:41:02:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West." 
 
"We did|do%2:41:01:: visit|visit%1:14:00:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And she let|let%2:41:00:: you go|go%2:38:01:: again?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in wonder. 
 
"She could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it, for she is|be%2:42:03:: melted," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Melted! Well, that is|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: news, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the man. "Who melted|melt%2:30:00:: 
her?" 
 
"It was|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, gravely. 
 
"Good gracious!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man, and he bowed|bow%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: 
before her. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he led|lead%2:38:01:: them into his little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: and locked|lock%2:35:00:: the spectacles|spectacle%1:10:00:: 
from the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 box|box%1:06:02:: on all their eyes, just|just%4:02:05:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:36:01:: before. 
Afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: through the gate|gate%1:06:00:: into the Emerald City, and 
when the people|people%1:14:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: from the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gate|gate%1:06:00:: that they had|have%2:40:00::

travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: and followed|follow%2:38:00:: them in a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: on guard|guard%1:07:00:: before the 
door, but he let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: at once|once%4:02:02:: and they were|be%2:42:03:: again|again%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: by the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who showed|show%2:38:00:: each of them to their old|old%3:00:01:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: at 
once, so they might rest|rest%2:32:00:: until the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to receive|receive%2:35:00:: them. 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: the news|news%1:10:01:: carried|carry%2:36:00:: straight|straight%3:00:00:continuous:01 to Oz that Dorothy and the 
other|other%3:00:00:: travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: again, after destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch; but Oz made|make%2:36:12:: no reply. They thought|think%2:31:03:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: would send|send%2:35:00:: 
for them at once, but he did|do%2:41:01:: not. They had|have%2:40:00:: no word|word%1:10:02:: from him the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting|waiting%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: tiresome|tiresome%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 and wearing, 
and at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they grew|grow%2:30:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: that Oz should treat|treat%2:41:00:: them in so|so%4:02:02:: poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 a 
fashion, after sending|send%2:38:01:: them to undergo|undergo%2:39:04:: hardships|hardship%1:26:01:: and slavery. So the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 asked|ask%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: to take|take%2:38:10:: another message|message%1:10:01:: to Oz, 
saying|say%2:32:00:: if he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him at once|once%4:02:02:: they would call|call%2:32:01:: the 
Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: them, and find|find%2:32:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: whether he kept|keep%2:41:03:: his promises|promise%1:10:00:: 
or not. When the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:07:: this message|message%1:10:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 
that he sent|send%2:38:01:: word|word%1:10:02:: for them to come|come%2:38:04:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: at four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
after nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. He had|have%2:40:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
in the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West, and he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:02:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them again. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: a sleepless|sleepless%3:00:00:awake:00 night, each thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: of the 
gift|gift%1:21:00:: Oz had|have%2:39:06:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: to bestow|bestow%2:40:02:: upon him. Dorothy fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: 
once, and then|then%4:02:00:: she dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: she was|be%2:42:05:: in Kansas, where Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:05:: 
telling|tell%2:32:04:: her how glad|glad%3:00:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: to have|have%2:39:06:: her little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:04:: at home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
Promptly|promptly%4:02:00:: at nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskered|whiskered%3:00:00:unshaven:00 soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: 
came|come%2:38:00:: to them, and four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: later|later%4:02:01:: they all went|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room|room%1:06:00:: of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Of course|course%1:14:00:: each one of them expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: in the shape|shape%1:08:00:: 
he had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:31:03:: before, and all were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: when they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
about and saw|saw%2:35:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: at all in the room. They kept|keep%2:42:03:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: 
and closer|close%3:00:01:: to one another, for the stillness|stillness%1:07:00:: of the empty|empty%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 than any of the forms|form%1:03:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz take. 
 
 
 
Presently|presently%4:02:01:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a Voice, seeming|seem%2:39:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: from somewhere|somewhere%4:02:00:: near 
the top|top%1:15:01:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 dome, and it said, solemnly. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
They looked|look%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: in every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room, and then, seeing|see%2:39:00:: no one, 
Dorothy asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:05:: everywhere," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Voice, "but to the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of common|common%3:00:02:: 
mortals|mortal%1:03:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: invisible. I|i%1:27:00:: will now|now%4:02:05:: seat|seat%1:06:00:: myself upon my throne, that 
you may converse|converse%2:32:00:: with me." Indeed, the Voice|voice%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: to come|come%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%4:02:04:: from the throne|throne%1:06:00:: itself; so they walked|walk%2:38:00:: toward it and stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
in a row|row%1:14:00:: while Dorothy said: 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to claim|claim%2:40:00:: our promise, O|o%1:10:00:: Oz." 
 
"What promise?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"You promised|promise%2:32:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: when the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
destroyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Is the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: destroyed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Voice, and Dorothy 
thought|think%2:31:03:: it trembled|tremble%2:38:00:: a little. 
 
"Yes," she answered, "I melted|melt%2:30:01:: her with a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water." 
 
"Dear me," said|say%2:32:00:: the Voice; "how sudden! Well, come|come%2:38:00:: to me to-morrow, 
for I must have|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it over." 
 
"You've had|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of time|time%1:28:05:: already," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, angrily. 
 
"We shan't wait|wait%2:42:00:: a day|day%1:28:00:: longer," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You must keep|keep%2:41:03:: your promises|promise%1:10:00:: to us!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it might be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: to frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: the Wizard, so|so%4:02:06:: 
he gave|give%2:41:00:: a large, loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar, which was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 and dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 that 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from him in alarm|alarm%1:12:00:: and tipped|tip%2:38:02:: over the screen|screen%1:06:05:: that 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in a corner. As it fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: that way, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: all of them were|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with wonder. For they 
saw, standing|standing%1:26:00:: in just|just%4:02:05:: the spot|spot%1:15:01:: the screen|screen%1:06:05:: had|have%2:40:00:: hidden, a little, old|old%3:00:02:: 
man, with a bald|bald%3:00:00:hairless:00 head|head%1:08:00:: and a wrinkled|wrinkled%3:00:00:: face, who seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: as they were. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, raising|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
toward the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 man|man%1:18:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, in a 
trembling|tremble%2:38:00:: voice, "but don't strike|strike%1:11:00:: me--please don't!--and I'll do|do%2:36:01:: 
anything you want|want%2:37:00:: me to." 
 
Our friends|friend%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: and dismay. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 Beast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:06:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the Lion. 
 
"No; you are|be%2:42:03:: all wrong," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, meekly. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
making|make%2:31:00:: believe." 
 
"Making believe!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "Are you not|not%4:02:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard?" 
 
"Hush, my dear," he said; "don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loud, or you will be|be%2:42:03:: 
overheard--and I should be|be%2:42:03:: ruined. I'm supposed|suppose%2:31:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard." 
 
"And aren't you?" she asked. 
 
"Not a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of it, my dear; I'm just|just%4:02:00:: a common|common%3:00:00:lowborn:00 man." 
 
"You're more|more%3:00:02:: than that," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; 
"you're a humbug." 
 
"Exactly so!" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, rubbing|rub%2:35:00:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: as 
if it pleased|please%2:37:00:: him; "I am|be%2:42:03:: a humbug." 
 
"But this is|be%2:42:03:: terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "how shall I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: 
my heart?" 
 
"Or I my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Or I my brains?" wailed|wail%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: the the tears|tear%1:08:01:: from his 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: with his coat-sleeve. 
 
 
 
"My dear|dear%4:02:00:: friends," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you not|not%4:02:00:: to speak|speak%2:32:01:: of these 
little|little%4:02:00:: things. Think|think%2:31:00:: of me, and the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 trouble|trouble%1:09:00:: I'm in at being|be%2:42:03:: 
found|find%2:32:00:: out." 
 
"Doesn't anyone else know|know%2:31:01:: you're a humbug?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No one knows|know%2:31:01:: it but you four--and myself," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I have|have%2:40:00:: 
fooled|fool%2:32:01:: everyone so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that I thought|think%2:31:03:: I should never|never%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:05:: found|find%2:31:09:: out. 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake|mistake%1:04:00:: my ever|ever%4:02:04:: letting|let%2:41:00:: you into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. 
Usually|usually%4:02:00:: I will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: my subjects, and so they believe|believe%2:31:04:: I am|be%2:42:06:: 
something terrible." 
 
"But, I don't understand," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was|be%2:42:03:: it 
that you appeared|appear%2:30:00:: to me as a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head?" 
 
"That was|be%2:42:06:: one of my tricks," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "Step this way, please, and 
I will tell|tell%2:32:00:: you all about it." 
 
He led|lead%2:38:01:: the way|way%1:23:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: chamber|chamber%1:06:00:: in the rear|rear%1:15:00:: of the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, 
and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him. He pointed|point%2:32:00:: to one corner, in which lay|lay%2:35:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Head, made|make%2:42:05:: out of many|many%3:00:00:: thicknesses|thickness%1:07:01:: of paper, and with a 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: face. 
 
"This I hung|hang%2:35:00:: from the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: by a wire," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "I stood|stand%2:35:00:: behind the 
screen|screen%1:06:04:: and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: a thread, to make|make%2:32:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: move|move%1:04:03:: and the mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: open." 
 
"But how about the voice?" she enquired. 
 
"Oh, I am|be%2:42:06:: a ventriloquist," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "and I can throw|throw%2:38:00:: 
the sound|sound%1:07:00:: of my voice|voice%1:07:00:: wherever I wish; so|so%4:02:06:: that you thought|think%2:31:01:: it was|be%2:42:06:: 
coming|come%2:42:03:: out of the Head. Here|here%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:04:: the other|other%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:06:01:: I used|use%2:34:01:: to deceive|deceive%2:41:00:: 
you." He showed|show%2:39:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: the dress|dress%1:06:00:: and the mask|mask%1:06:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: when 
he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady; and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: that his 
Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of skins, sewn together, with 
slats|slat%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: their sides|side%1:15:00:: out. As for the Ball|ball%1:06:03:: of Fire, the false|false%3:00:00:incorrect:00 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: hung|hang%2:35:00:: that also|also%4:02:00:: from the ceiling. It was|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a ball|ball%1:25:00:: of 
cotton, but when oil|oil%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: poured|pour%2:38:03:: upon it the ball|ball%1:25:00:: burned|burned%3:00:00:treated:00 fiercely. 
 
"Really," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself 
for being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug." 
 
"I am--I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: am," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, sorrowfully; "but it 
was|be%2:42:03:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:04:00:: I could do. Sit|sit%2:38:00:: down, please, there are|be%2:42:04:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of 
chairs; and I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and listened|listen%2:39:01:: while he told|tell%2:32:01:: the following|follow%2:42:05:: tale: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: in Omaha--" 
 
"Why, that isn't very|very%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from Kansas!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but it's farther|far%4:02:04:: from here," he said, shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: at her, 
sadly. "When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I became|become%2:42:01:: a ventriloquist, and at that I was|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: trained|train%2:31:01:: by a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 master. I can imitate|imitate%2:36:00:: any kind|kind%1:09:00:: of a 
bird|bird%1:05:00:: or beast." Here|here%4:02:00:: he mewed|mew%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: like a kitten|kitten%1:05:00:: that Toto pricked|prick%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
his ears|ear%1:08:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: where she was. "After a time," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: Oz, "I tired|tire%2:29:00:: of that, and became|become%2:42:01:: a balloonist." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A man|man%1:18:00:: who goes|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: on circus|circus%1:04:00:: day, so|so%4:02:06:: as to draw|draw%2:35:06:: a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: 
of people|people%1:14:00:: together|together%4:02:03:: and get|get%2:32:00:: them to pay|pay%2:40:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the circus," he explained. 
 
 
 
"Oh," she said; "I know." 
 
"Well, one day|day%1:28:03:: I went|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: and the ropes|rope%1:06:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: twisted, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that I couldn't come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: again. It went|go%2:42:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: above the clouds, so|so%4:02:06:: 
far|far%4:02:02:: that a current|current%1:11:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: struck|strike%2:35:01:: it and carried|carry%2:35:02:: it many, many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
away. For a day|day%1:28:02:: and a night|night%1:28:00:: I travelled|travel%2:38:00:: through the air, and on the 
morning|morning%1:28:01:: of the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day|day%1:28:00:: I awoke|awake%2:29:00:: and found|find%2:39:02:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: floating|float%2:38:00:: over 
a strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country. 
 
"It came|come%2:30:03:: down|down%4:02:00:: gradually, and I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: a bit. But I found|find%2:39:02:: myself 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: people, who, seeing|see%2:39:00:: me come|come%2:38:00:: from the clouds, 
thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard. Of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them think|think%2:31:01:: so, because 
they were|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of me, and promised|promise%2:32:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: anything I wished|wish%2:37:02:: them to. 
 
"Just to amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: myself, and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the good|good%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: busy, I ordered|order%2:32:01:: them to 
build|build%2:36:00:: this City, and my palace; and they did|do%2:41:01:: it all|all%4:02:00:: willingly|willingly%4:02:00:: and well. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: I thought, as the country|country%1:15:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and beautiful, I would 
call|call%2:32:02:: it the Emerald City, and to make|make%2:30:00:: the name|name%1:10:00:: fit|fit%2:42:04:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 I put|put%2:35:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: on all the people, so that everything they saw|saw%2:35:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: green." 
 
"But isn't everything here|here%4:02:00:: green?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No more|more%3:00:02:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: city," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz; "but when you wear|wear%2:29:00:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles, why of course|course%1:17:00:: everything you see|see%2:39:00:: looks|look%1:07:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 to 
you. The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, for I was|be%2:42:03:: a 
young|young%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: when the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: me here, and I am|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: man|man%1:18:04:: 
now. But my people|people%1:14:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: on their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that 
most|most%3:00:02:: of them think|think%2:31:01:: it really|really%4:02:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: an Emerald City, and it certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: place, abounding|abound%2:42:00:: in jewels|jewel%1:06:00:: and precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 metals, and every 
good|good%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:07:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: one happy. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to the 
people, and they like me; but ever|ever%4:02:04:: since this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: 
shut|shut%2:35:00:: myself up|up%4:02:00:: and would not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: any of them. 
 
"One of my greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fears|fear%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the Witches, for while I had|have%2:40:00:: no magical|magical%3:00:00:supernatural:00 
powers|power%1:07:00:: at all I soon|soon%4:02:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:04:: that the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: really|really%4:02:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to 
do|do%2:41:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 things. There were|be%2:42:00:: four of them in this country, and 
they ruled|rule%2:41:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:02:: and South|south%1:15:01:: and East|east%1:15:00:: and 
West. Fortunately, the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: and South|south%1:15:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: good, and 
I knew|know%2:31:01:: they would do|do%2:41:01:: me no harm; but the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and West|west%1:15:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: wicked, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: I was|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: 
than they themselves, they would surely|surely%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:36:00:: me. As it was, 
I lived|live%2:42:01:: in deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fear|fear%1:12:00:: of them for many|many%3:00:00:: years; so you can imagine|imagine%2:36:00:: how 
pleased|please%2:37:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: when I heard|hear%2:31:00:: your house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
of the East. When you came|come%2:38:00:: to me I was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to promise|promise%2:32:00:: anything if 
you would only|only%4:02:02:: do|do%2:36:01:: away|away%4:02:09:: with the other|other%3:00:00:: Witch; but, now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:41:00:: 
melted|melt%2:30:10:: her, I am|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: that I cannot keep|keep%2:41:03:: my promises." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: man," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really|really%4:02:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: man; but I'm a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: 
Wizard, I must admit." 
 
"Can't you give|give%2:40:00:: me brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You don't need them. You are|be%2:42:03:: learning|learn%2:31:00:: something every day. A|a%1:08:00:: baby|baby%1:18:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: brains, but it doesn't know|know%2:31:03:: much. Experience|experience%1:09:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:09:00:: 
that brings|bring%2:38:00:: knowledge, and the longer|long%3:00:02:: you are|be%2:42:05:: on earth|earth%1:15:00:: the more|more%3:00:01:: 
experience|experience%2:31:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:04:: to get." 
 
"That may all be|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "but I shall be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01:: 
unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: unless you give|give%2:40:03:: me brains." 
 
The false|false%3:00:00:: wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him carefully. 
 
"Well," he said, with a sigh, "I'm not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a magician, as I said; 
but if you will come|come%2:30:03:: to me to-morrow morning, I will stuff|stuff%2:35:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: 
with brains. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:00:: you how to use|use%2:34:01:: them, however; you must 
find|find%2:32:00:: that out|out%4:02:02:: for yourself." 
 
 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you--thank you!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "I'll find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to 
use|use%2:34:01:: them, never|never%4:02:00:: fear!" 
 
"But how about my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, anxiously. 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of courage, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "All you need|need%2:34:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: confidence|confidence%1:09:00:: in yourself. There is|be%2:42:00:: no living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: that is|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: when it faces|face%2:33:00:: danger. True|true%1:07:00:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: in facing|face%2:32:00:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: when 
you are|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and that kind|kind%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: in plenty." 
 
"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared|scar%2:35:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I 
shall really|really%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: unless you give|give%2:40:03:: me the sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: 
that makes|make%2:30:00:: one forget|forget%2:31:01:: he is|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
"Very well; I will give|give%2:40:03:: you that sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: to-morrow," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"How about my heart?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Why, as for that," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: to want|want%2:37:00:: a 
heart. It makes|make%2:30:00:: most|most%3:00:02:: people|people%1:14:00:: unhappy. If you only|only%4:02:02:: knew|know%2:31:01:: it, you are|be%2:42:03:: in 
luck|luck%1:19:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: a matter|matter%1:09:01:: of opinion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "For my 
part, I will bear|bear%2:31:00:: all the unhappiness|unhappiness%1:26:00:: without a murmur, if you will 
give|give%2:40:03:: me the heart." 
 
 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, meekly. "Come to me to-morrow and you shall 
have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. I have|have%2:40:00:: played|play%2:33:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: for so|so%4:02:02:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: that I may as 
well|well%4:02:03:: continue|continue%2:42:01:: the part|part%1:09:01:: a little|little%3:00:03:: longer." 
 
"And now," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "how am|be%2:42:06:: I to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" 
 
"We shall have|have%2:40:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about that," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "Give 
me two or three days|day%1:28:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: the matter|matter%1:09:00:: and I'll try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a 
way|way%1:15:00:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: you over the desert. In the meantime|meantime%1:28:00:: you shall all be|be%2:42:03:: 
treated|treat%2:41:00:: as my guests, and while you live|live%2:42:08:: in the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: my people|people%1:14:01:: 
will wait|wait%2:42:00:: upon you and obey|obey%2:41:00:: your slightest|slight%3:00:00:: wish. There is|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:01:: one

secret|secret%1:10:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: no one|one%1:23:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: a humbug." 
 
They agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: of what they had|have%2:40:00:: learned, and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to 
their rooms|room%1:06:00:: in high|high%3:00:02:: spirits. Even|even%4:02:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:39:06:: hope|hope%1:12:00:: that "The Great|great%1:18:00:: 
and Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Humbug," as she called|call%2:32:02:: him, would find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to send|send%2:38:01:: her 
back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and if he did|do%2:36:01:: that she was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: him 
everything. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVI. 
 
 
Next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to his friends: 
 
"Congratulate me. I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to get|get%2:39:00:: my brains|brain%1:09:00:: at last. When I 
return|return%2:32:01:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: liked|like%2:37:04:: you as you were," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, simply. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to like|like%2:37:05:: a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely|surely%4:02:00:: you 
will think|think%2:31:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: of me when you hear|hear%2:31:00:: the splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: my new|new%3:00:00:: brain|brain%1:09:01:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to turn|turn%2:42:00:: out." Then|then%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: to them all in a cheerful|cheerful%3:00:00:: 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, where he rapped|rap%2:35:00:: upon the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in and found|find%2:39:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the 
window, engaged|engage%2:41:06:: in deep|deep%3:00:02:: thought. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my brains," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, a little|little%3:00:01:: uneasily. 
 
"Oh, yes; sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in that chair, please," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "You must 
excuse|excuse%2:32:00:: me for taking|take%2:40:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: off, but I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: it in 
order|order%1:07:00:: to put|put%2:35:05:: your brains|brain%1:08:00:: in their proper|proper%3:00:00:: place." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You are|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: welcome|welcome%3:00:00:: to 
take|take%2:35:00:: my head|head%1:08:00:: off, as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as it will be|be%2:42:03:: a better|better%3:00:02:: one|one%1:23:00:: when you put|put%2:35:00:: it 
on again." 
 
So the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: unfastened|unfasten%2:35:01:: his head|head%1:08:00:: and emptied|empty%2:29:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the straw. Then|then%4:02:00:: he 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the back|back%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:40:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: a measure|measure%1:03:00:: of bran, which he mixed|mix%2:35:00:: 
with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: pins|pin%1:06:00:: and needles. Having|have%2:39:06:: shaken|shake%2:38:00:: them together|together%4:02:02:: 
thoroughly, he filled|fill%2:30:01:: the top|top%1:15:01:: of the Scarecrow's head|head%2:42:04:: with the mixture|mixture%1:27:00:: 
and stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the space|space%1:25:00:: with straw, to hold|hold%2:42:00:: it in place. When 
he had|have%2:40:00:: fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow's head|head%2:35:00:: on his body|body%1:08:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: to him, 
 
"Hereafter you will be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 man, for I have|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: you a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of 
bran-new brains." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: both pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: and proud|proud%3:00:00:: at the fulfillment|fulfillment%1:04:00:: of his 
greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 wish, and having|have%2:39:06:: thanked|thank%2:32:00:: Oz warmly|warmly%4:02:01:: he went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him curiously. His head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: bulging|bulge%2:42:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: at 
the top|top%1:15:00:: with brains. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel?" she asked. 
 
 
 
"I feel|feel%2:37:00:: wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly. "When I get|get%2:30:00:: used|use%2:34:01:: to my 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: I shall know|know%2:31:01:: everything." 
 
"Why are|be%2:42:06:: those needles|needle%1:06:00:: and pins|pin%1:06:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out of your head?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: proof|proof%1:09:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: sharp," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well, I must go|go%2:38:00:: to Oz and get|get%2:35:03:: my heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. So he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my heart." 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "But I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in your breast, so I can put|put%2:35:05:: your heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 place. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: it 
won't hurt|hurt%1:26:00:: you." 
 
"Oh, no;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I shall not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it at all." 
 
 
 
So Oz brought|bring%2:35:00:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of tinners' shears and cut|cut%2:35:00:: a small, square|square%1:06:01:: hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in the left|left%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's breast. Then, going|go%2:38:00:: to a chest|chest%1:08:00:: 
of drawers, he took|take%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart, made|make%2:36:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with sawdust. 
 
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked. 
 
"It is, indeed!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman, who was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased. "But 
is|be%2:42:03:: it a kind|kind%1:09:00:: heart?" 
 
"Oh, very!" answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: He put|put%2:35:00:: the heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the Woodman's breast|breast%1:08:01:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: replaced|replace%2:35:00:: the square|square%1:25:00:: of tin, soldering it neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: where 
it had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: cut. 
 
"There," said|say%2:32:00:: he; "now you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that any man|man%1:18:00:: might be|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: 
of. I'm sorry I had|have%2:40:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: a patch|patch%1:06:00:: on your breast, but it really|really%4:02:03:: 
couldn't be|be%2:42:03:: helped." 
 
"Never mind|mind%1:09:00:: the patch," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the happy|happy%3:00:00:: Woodman. "I am very|very%4:02:00:: 
grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you, and shall never|never%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: your kindness." 
 
 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: of it," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends, who wished|wish%2:32:00:: him every 
joy|joy%1:12:00:: on account|account%1:10:04:: of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my courage," announced|announce%2:32:00:: the Lion, entering|enter%2:38:00:: the room. 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man; "I will get|get%2:35:03:: it for you." 
 
He went|go%2:38:00:: to a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and reaching|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to a high|high%3:00:01:: shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: took|take%2:38:10:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
a square|square%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 bottle, the contents|content%1:14:00:: of which he poured|pour%2:38:04:: into a 
green-gold dish, beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved. Placing this before the Cowardly 
Lion, who sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: at it as if he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it, the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: said, 
 
"Drink." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "if it were|be%2:42:05:: inside|inside%3:00:00:: of you, it would be|be%2:42:06:: courage. 
You know, of course, that courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: always|always%4:02:00:: inside|inside%4:02:01:: one; so that 
this really|really%4:02:03:: cannot be|be%2:42:03:: called|call%2:32:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: swallowed|swallow%2:34:00:: it. 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I advise|advise%2:32:00:: you to drink|drink%2:34:00:: it as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: hesitated|hesitate%2:42:01:: no longer, but drank|drink%2:34:00:: till the dish|dish%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: empty. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel|feel%2:29:00:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Full of courage," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion, who went|go%2:38:00:: joyfully|joyfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: to tell|tell%2:32:00:: them of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
Oz, left|leave%2:42:02:: to himself, smiled|smile%2:29:00:: to think|think%2:36:00:: of his success|success%1:04:00:: in giving|give%2:40:03:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: what they thought|think%2:31:01:: 
they wanted. "How can I help|help%2:41:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: a humbug," he said, "when all 
these people|people%1:14:00:: make|make%2:36:15:: me do|do%2:41:01:: things|thing%1:04:00:: that everybody knows|know%2:31:01:: can't be|be%2:42:03:: done? It 
was|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: happy, 
because they imagined|imagine%2:36:00:: I could do|do%2:41:01:: anything. But it will take|take%2:42:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: than 
imagination|imagination%1:09:03:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: Dorothy back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: I don't 
know|know%2:31:01:: how it can be|be%2:42:03:: done." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVII. 
 
 
For three days|day%1:28:00:: Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: from Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: These were|be%2:42:03:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
for the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, although her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and 
contented. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: them there were|be%2:42:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: in 
his head; but he would not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: what they were|be%2:42:06:: because he knew|know%2:31:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could understand|understand%2:31:00:: them but himself. When the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: about 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast; and he told|tell%2:32:04:: Dorothy 
he had|have%2:40:00:: discovered|discover%2:36:00:: it to be|be%2:42:03:: a kinder|kind%3:00:00:: and more|more%3:00:01:: tender|tender%1:18:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: than the 
one he had|have%2:40:00:: owned|own%2:40:00:: when he was|be%2:42:02:: made|make%2:30:00:: of flesh. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he was|be%2:42:06:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: on earth, and would gladly|gladly%4:02:00:: face|face%2:33:00:: an army|army%1:14:00:: of men|man%1:18:00:: or a 
dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 Kalidahs. 
 
Thus|thus%4:02:00:: each of the little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: satisfied|satisfy%2:37:00:: except Dorothy, who 
longed|long%2:37:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas. 
 
On the fourth|fourth%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day, to her great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: for her, and when she 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he said, pleasantly: 
 
"Sit down, my dear; I think|think%2:31:03:: I have|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: the way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:02:: you out of 
this country." 
 
"And back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" she asked, eagerly. 
 
"Well, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: about Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "for I haven't the 
faintest|faint%3:00:00:perceptible:00 notion|notion%1:09:02:: which way|way%1:15:00:: it lies. But the first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert, and then|then%4:02:00:: it should be|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to find|find%2:36:00:: your way|way%1:23:00:: home." 
 
"How can I cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert?" she enquired. 
 
"Well, I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you what I|i%1:23:00:: think," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "You see, 
when I came|come%2:38:04:: to this country|country%1:15:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: in a balloon. You also|also%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
through the air, being|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: by a cyclone. So I believe|believe%2:31:00:: the best|best%3:00:00:: 
way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: across the desert|desert%1:15:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: through the air. Now, it is|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: beyond my powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:36:00:: a cyclone; but I've been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: the 
matter|matter%1:09:01:: over, and I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I can make|make%2:36:01:: a balloon." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A balloon," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "is made|make%2:36:05:: of silk, which is|be%2:42:03:: coated|coat%2:29:00:: with glue|glue%1:27:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: the gas|gas%1:27:00:: in it. I have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: in the Palace, so it will 
be|be%2:42:02:: no trouble|trouble%1:11:01:: for us to make|make%2:36:00:: the balloon. But in all this country|country%1:14:01:: 
there is|be%2:42:00:: no gas|gas%1:27:02:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: with, to make|make%2:32:00:: it float." 
 
"If it won't float," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "it will be|be%2:42:03:: of no use|use%1:07:00:: to us." 
 
"True," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "But there is|be%2:42:00:: another way|way%1:04:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: it float, 
which is|be%2:42:06:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: it with hot|hot%3:00:01:: air. Hot air|air%1:27:00:: isn't as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as gas, for 
if the air|air%1:27:00:: should get|get%2:30:00:: cold|cold%3:00:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: would come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the desert, 
and we should be|be%2:42:03:: lost." 
 
"We!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the girl; "are you going|go%2:38:00:: with me?" 
 
"Yes, of course," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I am tired|tire%2:29:00:: of being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug. If I 
should go|go%2:38:01:: out of this Palace|palace%1:06:00:: my people|people%1:14:00:: would soon|soon%4:02:00:: discover|discover%2:31:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a 
Wizard, and then|then%4:02:00:: they would be|be%2:42:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: with me for having|have%2:30:00:: deceived|deceive%2:32:00:: them. 
So|so%4:02:09:: I have|have%2:40:00:: to stay|stay%2:30:00:: shut|shut%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in these rooms|room%1:06:00:: all day, and it gets|get%2:30:00:: tiresome. 
I'd much|much%4:02:00:: rather|rather%4:02:01:: go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: with you and be|be%2:42:05:: in a circus|circus%1:14:00:: again." 
 
 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: your company," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if you will help|help%2:41:00:: me sew|sew%2:35:00:: the silk|silk%1:06:00:: 
together, we will begin|begin%2:30:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: on our balloon." 
 
So Dorothy took|take%2:35:00:: a needle|needle%1:06:00:: and thread, and as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as Oz cut|cut%2:35:00:: the strips|strip%1:17:00:: 
of silk|silk%1:06:00:: into proper|proper%3:00:00:: shape|shape%1:09:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: sewed|sew%2:35:00:: them neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together. First|first%1:24:00:: 
there was|be%2:42:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of light|light%3:00:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk, then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of dark|dark%3:00:02:: green|green%1:07:00:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of emerald green; for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: a fancy|fancy%1:12:00:: to make|make%2:36:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: 
in different|different%3:00:00:: shades|shade%1:07:00:: of the color|color%1:07:00:: about them. It took|take%2:40:06:: three days|day%1:28:00:: to 
sew|sew%2:35:00:: all the strips|strip%1:17:00:: together, but when it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: they had|have%2:40:01:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
bag|bag%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than twenty feet|foot%1:23:00:: long. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz painted|paint%2:35:00:: it on the inside|inside%1:15:00:: with a coat|coat%1:06:01:: of thin|thin%3:00:01:: glue, to make|make%2:30:00:: it 
air-tight, after which he announced|announce%2:32:00:: that the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. 
 
"But we must have|have%2:40:00:: a basket|basket%1:06:00:: to ride|ride%2:38:01:: in," he said. So he sent|send%2:38:01:: the 
soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: for a big|big%3:00:01:: clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: basket, which he 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: with many|many%3:00:00:: ropes|rope%1:06:00:: to the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of the balloon. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: all ready, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: word|word%1:10:06:: to his people|people%1:14:00:: that he was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: 
to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit|visit%1:04:02:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 brother|brother%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in the clouds. 
The news|news%1:10:00:: spread|spread%2:32:02:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: throughout the city|city%1:15:00:: and everyone came|come%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sight. 
 
Oz ordered|order%2:32:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: out|out%4:02:04:: in front|front%1:15:02:: of the Palace, and the 
people|people%1:14:00:: gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it with much|much%3:00:00:: curiosity. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: a 
big|big%3:00:01:: pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood, and now|now%4:02:05:: he made|make%2:36:00:: a fire|fire%1:22:00:: of it, and Oz held|hold%2:35:01:: the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: 
of the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: over the fire|fire%1:06:00:: so that the hot|hot%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: that arose|arise%2:42:00:: from it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the silken|silken%3:00:00:bright:00 bag. Gradually|gradually%4:02:00:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: swelled|swell%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air, until finally|finally%4:02:02:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: just|just%4:02:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the ground. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz got|get%2:38:12:: into the basket|basket%1:06:00:: and said|say%2:32:00:: to all the people|people%1:14:00:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:00:: going|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit. While I am|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
will rule|rule%2:41:00:: over you. I command|command%2:32:00:: you to obey|obey%2:41:00:: him as you would me." 
 
The balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: by this time|time%1:11:00:: tugging|tug%2:35:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: at the rope|rope%1:06:00:: that held|hold%2:35:01:: it to 
the ground, for the air|air%1:27:00:: within it was|be%2:42:03:: hot, and this made|make%2:30:00:: it so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%4:02:00:: 
lighter|light%3:00:01:: in weight|weight%1:07:00:: than the air|air%1:27:00:: without that it pulled|pull%2:35:00:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: to rise|rise%2:38:00:: 
into the sky. 
 
"Come, Dorothy!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Wizard; "hurry up, or the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: will fly|fly%2:38:00:: 
away." 
 
"I can't find|find%2:40:00:: Toto anywhere," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:00:: to 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: behind. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: into the crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to bark|bark%1:11:00:: at 
a kitten, and Dorothy at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 found|find%2:40:00:: him. She picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and ran|run%2:38:00:: 
toward the balloon. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:05:: within a few|few%3:00:00:: steps|step%1:04:00:: of it, and Oz was|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: 
to help|help%2:41:00:: her into the basket, when, crack! went|go%2:38:00:: the ropes, and the 
balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: without her. 
 
 
 
"Come back!" she screamed; "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go, too!" 
 
"I can't come|come%2:38:00:: back, my dear," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz from the basket. "Good-bye!" 
 
"Good-bye!" shouted|shout%2:32:01:: everyone, and all eyes|eye%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: upward|upward%4:02:00:: to 
where the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: in the basket, rising|rise%2:38:00:: every moment|moment%1:28:00:: 
farther|far%4:02:00:: and farther|far%4:02:00:: into the sky. 
 
And that was|be%2:42:03:: the last|last%3:00:00:: any of them ever|ever%4:02:04:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: of Oz, the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Wizard, 
though he may have|have%2:40:00:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: Omaha|omaha%1:15:00:: safely, and be|be%2:42:05:: there|there%4:02:00:: now, for all we 
know. But the people|people%1:14:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:02:: him lovingly, and said|say%2:32:00:: to one another, 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: our friend. When he was|be%2:42:05:: here|here%4:02:00:: he built|build%2:36:00:: for us this 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Emerald City, and now|now%4:02:05:: he is|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:30:08:: he has|have%2:40:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: the Wise|wise%1:07:00:: 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over us." 
 
Still, for many|many%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: they grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: over the loss|loss%1:11:01:: of the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 
Wizard, and would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: comforted. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVIII. 
 
 
Dorothy wept|weep%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: at the passing|passing%1:11:02:: of her hope|hope%1:12:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: home|home%1:15:02:: to 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again; but when she thought|think%2:31:00:: it all over she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: gone|go%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. And she also|also%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:37:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: at losing|lose%2:40:02:: Oz, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: her companions. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to her and said, 
 
"Truly I should be|be%2:42:03:: ungrateful|ungrateful%3:00:00:unpleasant:00 if I failed|fail%2:41:02:: to mourn|mourn%2:37:00:: for the man|man%1:18:00:: who gave|give%2:36:00:: 
me my lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart. I should like|like%2:37:01:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: because Oz is|be%2:42:03:: gone, 
if you will kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: my tears, so that I shall not|not%4:02:00:: rust." 
 
 
 
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought|bring%2:35:00:: a towel|towel%1:06:00:: at once. Then|then%4:02:00:: 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: wept|weep%2:29:00:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 minutes, and she watched|watch%2:39:00:: the tears|tear%1:08:01:: 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: them away|away%4:02:03:: with the towel. When he had|have%2:40:01:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: 
he thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: himself thoroughly|thoroughly%4:02:00:: with his jewelled 
oil-can, to guard|guard%2:33:00:: against mishap. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of the Emerald City, and although 
he was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of him. "For," they said, 
"there is|be%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: another city|city%1:15:00:: in all the world|world%1:05:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by a 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: man." And, so|so%4:02:05:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they knew, they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: right. 
 
The morning|morning%1:28:00:: after the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: with Oz the four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: in the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and talked|talk%2:32:01:: matters|matter%1:09:01:: over. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: and the others stood|stand%2:35:00:: respectfully|respectfully%4:02:00:: before him. 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: unlucky," said|say%2:32:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: ruler; "for this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: and 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: belong|belong%2:40:00:: to us, and we can do|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we please. When 
I remember|remember%2:31:00:: that a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: ago I was|be%2:42:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a farmer's 
cornfield, and that I am|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City, I am|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: satisfied|satisfied%3:00:00:contented:00 with my lot." 
 
"I also," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, "am well|well%4:02:05:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with my new|new%3:00:00:: heart; 
and, really, that was|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I wished|wish%2:32:02:: in all the world." 
 
"For my part, I am|be%2:42:03:: content|content%1:24:00:: in knowing|know%2:31:02:: I am|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: brave|brave%2:42:00:: as any beast|beast%1:03:00:: that 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: lived, if not|not%4:02:00:: braver," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, modestly, 
 
 
 
"If Dorothy would only|only%4:02:02:: be|be%2:42:03:: contented|contented%3:00:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: in the Emerald City," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "we might all be|be%2:42:03:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: together." 
 
"But I don't want|want%2:37:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: here," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
Kansas, and live|live%2:42:08:: with Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry." 
 
"Well, then, what can be|be%2:42:03:: done?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to think, and he thought|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: that the pins|pin%1:06:00:: 
and needles|needle%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to stick|stick%2:35:03:: out of his brains. Finally|finally%4:02:02:: he said: 
 
"Why not|not%4:02:00:: call|call%2:32:01:: the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, and asked|ask%2:32:01:: them to carry|carry%2:35:02:: you over 
the desert?" 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of that!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, joyfully. "It's just|just%4:02:00:: the 
thing. I'll go|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: for the Golden Cap." 
 
When she brought|bring%2:38:00:: it into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: she spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 words, 
and soon|soon%4:02:00:: the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: through an open|open%3:00:01:: window|window%1:17:00:: 
and stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside her. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:01:: us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King, 
bowing|bow%2:38:00:: before the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. "What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish?" 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: you to fly|fly%2:38:00:: with me to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
But the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: his head. 
 
"That cannot be|be%2:42:03:: done," he said. "We belong|belong%2:40:00:: to this country|country%1:14:01:: alone, and 
cannot leave|leave%1:04:00:: it. There has|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:04:: a Winged Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: yet, 
and I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there never|never%4:02:00:: will be, for they don't belong|belong%2:42:06:: there. We 
shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to serve|serve%2:41:01:: you in any way|way%1:07:01:: in our power, but we cannot 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. Good-bye." 
 
And with another bow|bow%1:10:01:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: spread|spread%2:35:03:: his wings|wing%1:05:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the window, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: with disappointment. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: wasted|waste%2:34:00:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: to no purpose," she said, 
"for the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: cannot help|help%1:04:00:: me." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: bad!" said|say%2:32:00:: the tender|tender%1:06:02:: hearted Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again, and his head|head%1:08:00:: bulged|bulge%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: 
that Dorothy feared|fear%2:37:03:: it would burst. 
 
"Let us call|call%2:32:05:: in the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers," he said, "and 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: his advice." 
 
 
 
So the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: summoned|summon%2:32:00:: and entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room timidly, for 
while Oz was|be%2:42:03:: alive|alive%3:00:01:: he never|never%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: allowed|allow%2:41:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: than the door. 
 
"This little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the soldier, "wishes to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. How can she do|do%2:41:01:: so?" 
 
"I cannot tell," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier; "for nobody|nobody%1:18:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: 
the desert, unless it is|be%2:42:06:: Oz himself." 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: who can help|help%2:41:00:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly. 
 
"Glinda might," he suggested. 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Glinda?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the South. She is|be%2:42:03:: the most|most%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: of all the Witches, 
and rules|rule%1:26:00:: over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle|castle%1:06:02:: stands|stand%2:35:00:: on the edge|edge%1:15:00:: 
of the desert, so she may know|know%2:31:03:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Witch, isn't she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
"The Quadlings think|think%2:31:01:: she is|be%2:42:03:: good," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and she is|be%2:42:03:: kind 
to everyone. I have|have%2:40:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: that Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: woman, who knows|know%2:31:01:: 
how to keep|keep%2:42:03:: young|young%3:00:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: she has|have%2:40:00:: lived." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: to her castle?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: to the South," he answered, "but it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: 
full|full%3:00:02:ample:00 of dangers|danger%1:26:01:: to travellers. There are|be%2:42:04:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: in the woods, and 
a race|race%1:14:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 men|man%1:18:00:: who do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: their country. 
For this reason|reason%1:16:00:: none|none%1:28:00:: of the Quadlings ever|ever%4:02:04:: come|come%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:38:01:: them and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"It seems, in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of dangers, that the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: Dorothy can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
to travel|travel%2:38:00:: to the Land|land%1:26:00:: of the South|south%1:15:02:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Glinda to help|help%2:41:00:: her. For, 
of course, if Dorothy stays|stay%2:30:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: she will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"You must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I have," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I shall go|go%2:38:00:: with Dorothy," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for I am|be%2:42:03:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: of your 
city|city%1:15:00:: and long|long%3:00:02:: for the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and the country|country%1:15:01:: again. I am|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a wild|wild%3:00:02:: 
beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need|need%2:34:00:: someone|someone%1:03:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: her." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," agreed|agree%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "My axe|axe%1:06:00:: may be|be%2:42:03:: of service|service%1:07:00:: to her; 
so|so%4:02:05:: I, also, will go|go%2:38:00:: with her to the Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South." 
 
"When shall we start?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise. 
 
"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: brains. 
She lifted|lift%2:38:00:: me from the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: and brought|bring%2:38:00:: me to the 
Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. So my good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: all due|due%3:00:02:: to her, and I shall never|never%4:02:00:: 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her until she starts|start%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for good|good%3:00:01:: and all." 
 
"Thank you," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, gratefully. "You are|be%2:42:03:: all very|very%3:00:00:same:02 kind|kind%1:09:00:: to me. 
But I should like|like%2:37:01:: to start|start%2:30:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"We shall go|go%2:38:00:: to-morrow morning," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "So now|now%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: 
us all get|get%2:30:00:: ready, for it will be|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey."

The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: Dorothy kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: good-bye, and 
they all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers, who 
had|have%2:40:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with them as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as the gate. When the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the 
Gate|gate%1:06:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: he wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: that they could leave|leave%2:38:01:: the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: into new|new%3:00:00:: trouble. But he at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: their 
spectacles, which he put|put%2:35:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them many|many%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: wishes|wish%1:10:01:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: with them. 
 
"You are|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: our ruler," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Scarecrow; "so you must come|come%2:38:00:: 
back|back%4:02:04:: to us as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall if I am|be%2:42:03:: able," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: replied; "but I must 
help|help%2:41:00:: Dorothy to get|get%2:38:00:: home, first." 
 
As Dorothy bade|bid%2:32:01:: the good-natured|good-natured%3:00:00:: Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 farewell|farewell%1:10:00:: she said, 
 
"I have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: in your lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 City, and everyone 
has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to me. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:04:: you how grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: I am." 
 
"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like|like%2:37:01:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: you with 
us, but if it is|be%2:42:06:: your wish|wish%1:12:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: I hope|hope%2:37:01:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: a 
way." He then|then%4:02:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the outer|out%3:00:00:outer:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: forth|forth%4:02:00:: 
and started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey. 
 
The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: as our friends|friend%1:18:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: their faces|face%1:08:00:: toward the 
Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South. They were|be%2:42:03:: all in the best|best%3:00:00:: of spirits, and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: 
and chatted|chat%2:32:00:: together. Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: once|once%4:02:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with the hope|hope%1:12:01:: of 
getting|get%2:32:00:: home, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:05:: 
of use|use%1:07:00:: to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: with delight|delight%1:09:00:: 
and whisked|whisk%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: in pure|pure%3:00:02:: joy|joy%1:12:00:: at being|be%2:42:04:: in the 
country|country%1:15:00:: again, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around them and chased|chase%2:38:00:: the moths|moth%1:05:00:: and 
butterflies, barking|bark%2:32:01:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: all the time. 
 
"City life|life%1:26:01:: does|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: agree|agree%2:32:00:: with me at all," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion, as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: at a brisk|brisk%3:00:00:energetic:00 pace. "I have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: since I lived|live%2:42:08:: 
there, and now|now%4:02:05:: I am|be%2:42:04:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 for a chance|chance%1:26:00:: to show|show%2:39:02:: the other|other%3:00:00:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: how 
courageous|courageous%3:00:04:: I have|have%2:40:00:: grown." 
 
 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and took|take%2:39:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 look|look%1:04:00:: at the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. All they 
could see|see%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: a mass|mass%1:14:02:: of towers|tower%1:06:00:: and steeples|steeple%1:06:00:: behind the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 walls, 
and high|high%3:00:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: above everything the spires|spire%1:06:00:: and dome|dome%1:06:00:: of the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard, after all," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast. 
 
"He knew|know%2:31:03:: how to give|give%2:40:03:: me brains, and very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: brains, too," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"If Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:39:00:: a dose|dose%1:06:00:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: he gave|give%2:40:03:: me," added|add%2:32:01:: the 
Lion, "he would have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. Oz had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: kept|keep%2:41:03:: the promise|promise%1:10:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: her, but he 
had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: man, 
even|even%4:02:01:: if he was|be%2:42:03:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard. 
 
The first|first%3:00:00:: day's journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: through the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: and bright|bright%3:00:02:: 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that stretched|stretch%2:42:00:: about the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: on every side. They 
slept|sleep%2:29:00:: that night|night%1:28:00:: on the grass, with nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the stars|star%1:17:01:: over them; 
and they rested|rest%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: indeed. 
 
In the morning|morning%1:28:00:: they travelled|travel%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 wood. There 
was|be%2:42:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: of going|go%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: it, for it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to extend|extend%2:42:01:: to the right|right%1:15:00:: and 
left|leave%2:31:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see; and, besides, they did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: change|change%1:04:00:: 
the direction|direction%1:15:00:: of their journey|journey%1:04:00:: for fear|fear%1:12:00:: of getting|get%2:30:00:: lost. So they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
for the place|place%1:15:00:: where it would be|be%2:42:03:: easiest|easy%3:00:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: into the forest. 
 
The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: in the lead, finally|finally%4:02:00:: discovered|discover%2:39:03:: a big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: 
with such|such%3:00:00:much:00 wide|wide%3:00:00:: spreading-branches that there was|be%2:42:03:: room|room%1:23:00:: for the party|party%1:14:00:: 
to pass|pass%2:38:00:: underneath. So he walked|walk%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: to the tree, but just|just%4:02:05:: as he 
came|come%2:38:00:: under the first|first%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: they bent|bent%3:00:00:damaged:00 down and twined|twin%2:35:00:: around him, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 minute|minute%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: from the ground|ground%1:17:00:: and flung headlong|headlong%4:02:00:: 
among his fellow travellers. 
 
This did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:37:00:: the Scarecrow, but it surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: him, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: dizzy|dizzy%3:00:00:ill:01 when Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up. 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:04:: another space|space%1:15:00:: between the trees," called|call%2:32:09:: the Lion. 
 
 
 
"Let me try|try%2:41:00:: it first," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me to 
get|get%2:30:00:: thrown|throw%2:35:00:: about." He walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to another tree, as he spoke, but its 
branches|branch%1:17:01:: immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: him and tossed|toss%2:35:04:: him back|back%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: strange," exclaimed Dorothy; "what shall we do?" 
 
"The trees|tree%1:20:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:42:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: us, and stop|stop%2:41:00:: our 
journey," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I will try|try%2:41:00:: it myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, and shouldering|shoulder%2:35:02:: 
his axe|axe%1:06:00:: he marched|march%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the first|first%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: that had|have%2:40:00:: handled|handle%2:35:01:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: so roughly. When a big|big%3:00:01:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to seize|seize%2:35:00:: him the 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: at it so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that he cut|cut%2:35:00:: it in two. At once|once%4:02:02:: 
the tree|tree%1:20:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: shaking|shake%2:38:00:: all its branches|branch%1:20:00:: as if in pain, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: under it. 
 
"Come on!" he shouted|shout%2:32:00:: to the others; "be quick!" 
 
They all ran|run%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: and passed|pass%2:38:00:: under the tree|tree%1:20:00:: without injury, except 
Toto, who was|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: by a small|small%3:00:00:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: and shaken|shake%2:38:00:: until he howled. But 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: promptly|promptly%4:02:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: the branch|branch%1:20:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: free. 
 
The other|other%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: them back, so they 
made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the first|first%3:00:00:: row|row%1:14:00:: of trees|tree%1:20:00:: could bend|bend%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
their branches, and that probably|probably%4:02:00:: these were|be%2:42:06:: the policemen|policeman%1:18:00:: of the 
forest, and given|give%2:40:03:: this wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: in order|order%1:26:02:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of it. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with ease|ease%1:07:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: 
to the further|further%3:00:00:far:00 edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found|find%2:40:02:: 
before them a high|high%3:00:01:: wall, which seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of white|white%3:00:01:: china. It was|be%2:42:06:: 
smooth, like the surface|surface%1:06:00:: of a dish, and higher|high%3:00:01:: than their heads. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"I will make|make%2:36:00:: a ladder," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for we certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: must 
climb|climb%1:04:00:: over the wall." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XX. 
 
 
While the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: making|make%2:36:01:: a ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: from wood|wood%1:27:00:: which he found|find%2:40:02:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and slept, for she was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: by the long|long%3:00:02:: walk. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: curled|curl%2:30:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: beside him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: watched|watch%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: while he worked, and said|say%2:32:00:: to him: 
 
"I cannot think|think%2:31:00:: why this wall|wall%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: here, nor what it is|be%2:42:06:: made|make%2:42:05:: of." 
 
"Rest your brains|brain%1:09:01:: and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: worry|worry%2:37:12:: about the wall," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman; "when we have|have%2:40:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: over it we shall know|know%2:31:01:: what is|be%2:42:05:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
After a time|time%1:28:05:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: finished. It looked|look%2:39:01:: clumsy, but the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and would answer|answer%2:32:00:: their purpose. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: waked|wake%2:29:02:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto, and told|tell%2:32:04:: them that the 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: first, but he 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: awkward|awkward%3:00:00:inconvenient:00 that Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: behind|behind%4:02:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: him 
from falling|fall%2:38:03:: off. When he got|get%2:30:02:: his head|head%1:08:00:: over the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Oh, my!" 
 
"Go on," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: up and sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the 
wall, and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: over and cried, 
 
"Oh, my!" just|just%4:02:05:: as the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: done. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Toto came|come%2:38:00:: up, and immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark, but Dorothy made|make%2:36:12:: 
him be|be%2:42:03:: still. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: next, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: last; but 
both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they looked|look%2:39:00:: over the wall. 
When they were|be%2:42:05:: all sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in a row|row%1:14:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: they 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: a strange|strange%3:00:00:: sight. 
 
 
 
Before them was|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 stretch|stretch%1:17:00:: of country|country%1:15:01:: having|have%2:42:00:: a floor|floor%1:06:00:: as smooth|smooth%1:04:00:: 
and shining|shin%2:38:00:: and white|white%3:00:01:: as the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: platter. Scattered|scatter%2:35:00:: 
around were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of china|china%1:06:00:: and painted|paint%2:35:00:: in the 
brightest|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 colours. These houses|house%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: small, the biggest|big%3:00:01:: of them 
reaching|reach%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: high|high%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's waist. There were|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
little|little%3:00:01:: barns, with china|china%1:06:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: around them, and many|many%3:00:00:: cows|cow%1:05:01:: and sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: 
and horses|horse%1:05:00:: and pigs|pig%1:05:00:: and chickens, all made|make%2:42:05:: of china, were|be%2:42:04:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: 
about in groups. 
 
But the strangest|strange%3:00:00:: of all were|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in this queer|queer%1:18:00:: 
country. There were|be%2:42:03:: milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored 
bodices|bodice%1:06:00:: and golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:07:01:: all over their gowns; and princesses|princess%1:18:00:: with 
most|most%4:02:01:: gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frocks|frock%1:06:00:: of silver|silver%1:27:00:: and gold|gold%1:27:00:: and purple; and shepherds|shepherd%1:18:00:: 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in knee-breeches with pink|pink%1:07:00:: and yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 stripes|stripe%1:06:00:: down 
them, and golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 buckles|buckle%1:06:00:: on their shoes; and princes|prince%1:18:00:: with jewelled|jewel%2:36:00:: 
crowns|crown%1:06:01:: upon their heads, wearing|wear%2:29:00:: ermine|ermine%1:27:00:: robes|robe%1:06:01:: and satin doublets; and 
funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 clowns|clown%1:18:00:: in ruffled|ruffle%2:37:01:: gowns, with round|round%3:00:00:: red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:15:01:: upon their cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: 
and tall, pointed|point%2:32:00:: caps. And, strangest of all, these people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
made|make%2:42:05:: of china, even|even%4:02:00:: to their clothes, and were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that the 
tallest|tall%3:00:00:: of them was|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: higher|high%3:00:01:: than Dorothy's knee. 
 
No one|one%1:23:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: so|so%4:02:07:: much|much%3:00:00:: as look|look%1:07:01:: at the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: at first, except one 
little|little%3:00:01:: purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 china|china%1:06:00:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: with an extra-large head, which came|come%2:38:00:: to the 
wall|wall%1:06:00:: and barked|bark%2:32:01:: at them in a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 voice, afterwards|afterwards%4:02:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"How shall we get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
They found|find%2:39:02:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: pull|pull%2:35:00:: it up, so the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: the wall|wall%1:06:00:: and the others jumped|jump%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon him so|so%4:02:09:: 
that the hard|hard%3:00:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: their feet. Of course|course%1:15:00:: they took|take%2:31:03:: 
pains|pain%1:18:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to light|light%2:38:00:: on his head|head%1:08:00:: and get|get%2:30:02:: the pins|pin%1:06:00:: in their feet. When 
all were|be%2:42:03:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: down they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, whose body|body%1:08:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: flattened|flatten%2:30:00:: out, and patted|pat%2:35:00:: his straw|straw%1:27:00:: into shape|shape%1:07:00:: again. 
 
"We must cross|cross%2:38:00:: this strange|strange%3:00:00:: place|place%1:15:00:: in order|order%1:07:00:: to get|get%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "for it would be|be%2:42:03:: unwise|unwise%3:00:00:foolish:00 for us to go|go%2:41:00:: any other|other%3:00:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: 
except due|due%3:00:02:: South." 
 
They began|begin%2:30:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the country|country%1:15:02:: of the china|china%1:06:00:: people, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to was|be%2:42:06:: a china|china%1:06:00:: milk-maid milking|milk%2:30:00:: a china|china%1:06:00:: cow. 
As they drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the cow|cow%1:05:01:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a kick|kick%1:04:00:: and kicked|kick%2:38:00:: over the 
stool, the pail, and even|even%4:02:00:: the milk-maid herself, all falling|fall%2:38:00:: on the 
china|china%1:06:00:: ground|ground%1:27:00:: with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clatter. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: shocked|shock%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:31:01:: that the cow|cow%1:05:01:: had|have%2:30:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg|leg%1:08:01:: short|short%3:00:01:: off, 
and that the pail|pail%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in several|several%3:00:00:some:00 small|small%3:00:00:: pieces, while the poor|poor%3:00:00:: 
milk-maid had|have%2:40:00:: a nick|nick%1:07:00:: in her left|left%3:00:00:: elbow. 
 
"There!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the milk-maid, angrily; "see what you have|have%2:40:00:: done! My 
cow|cow%1:05:01:: has|have%2:42:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg, and I must take|take%2:38:09:: her to the mender's shop|shop%1:06:00:: 
and have|have%2:30:00:: it glued|glue%2:35:00:: on again. What do|do%2:36:00:: you mean|mean%2:32:01:: by coming|come%2:38:04:: here|here%4:02:01:: and 
frightening|frightening%3:00:00:alarming:00 my cow?" 
 
"I'm very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sorry," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy; "please forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: us." 
 
But the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: milk-maid was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: vexed|vex%2:31:02:: to make|make%2:41:00:: any answer. She 
picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the leg|leg%1:08:02:: sulkily|sulkily%4:02:00:: and led|lead%2:38:01:: her cow|cow%1:05:01:: away, the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 animal|animal%1:03:00:: 
limping|limp%2:38:00:: on three legs. As she left|leave%2:31:05:: them the milk-maid cast|cast%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: 
reproachful|reproachful%3:00:00:unfavorable:02 glances|glance%1:04:00:: over her shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: at the clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 strangers, 
holding|hold%2:35:00:: her nicked|nick%2:35:01:: elbow|elbow%1:08:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: to her side. 
 
 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: at this mishap. 
 
"We must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: here," said|say%2:32:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 Woodman, "or we 
may hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: these pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: so they will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:30:00:: over it." 
 
A little|little%3:00:01:: farther|far%4:02:00:: on Dorothy met|meet%2:38:01:: a most|most%4:02:01:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: young|young%3:00:00:: 
princess, who stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%4:02:04:: as she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and started|start%2:38:04:: to 
run|run%2:38:04:: away. 
 
Dorothy wanted|want%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: of the Princess, so she ran|run%2:38:00:: after her; but 
the china|china%1:06:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
"Don't chase me! don't chase me!" 
 
She had|have%2:40:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 little|little%3:00:01:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: that Dorothy stopped|stop%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"Why not?" 
 
"Because," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the princess, also|also%4:02:00:: stopping, a safe|safe%3:00:01:: distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
away, "if I run|run%2:38:00:: I may fall|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and break|break%2:29:04:: myself." 
 
"But couldn't you be|be%2:42:03:: mended?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh, yes; but one is|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: after being|be%2:42:03:: mended, you know," 
replied|reply%2:32:00:: the princess. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: not," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Now there is|be%2:42:04:: Mr.|mr.%1:10:00:: Joker, one of our clowns," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the china|china%1:06:00:: 
lady, "who is|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: upon his head. He has|have%2:40:00:: broken|break%2:41:00:: 
himself so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in a hundred places, and doesn't 
look|look%2:39:01:: at all pretty. Here|here%4:02:00:: he comes|come%2:38:00:: now, so you can see|see%2:39:00:: for yourself." 
 
Indeed, a jolly|jolly%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Clown|clown%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: toward them, and 
Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: that in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of his pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of red|red%1:07:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: completely|completely%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with cracks, running|run%2:38:01:: every 
which way|way%1:07:01:: and showing|show%2:39:00:: plainly|plainly%4:02:00:: that he had|have%2:40:01:: been|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in many|many%3:00:00:: places. 
 
The Clown|clown%1:18:01:: put|put%2:35:05:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: in his pockets, and after puffing|puff%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his 
cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: and nodding|nod%2:32:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: at them saucily|saucily%4:02:01:: he said,

Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: I. 
 
 
Dorothy lived|live%2:42:08:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: prairies, with Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: 
Henry, who was|be%2:42:03:: a farmer, and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, who was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer's wife. 
Their house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: small, for the lumber|lumber%1:27:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: it had|have%2:40:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:38:10:: 
by wagon|wagon%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles. There were|be%2:42:04:: four walls, a floor|floor%1:06:00:: and a roof, 
which made|make%2:42:05:: one room; and this room|room%1:06:00:: contained|contain%2:42:00:: a rusty|rusty%3:00:00:rusted:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
stove, a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, 
and the beds. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in one corner, 
and Dorothy a little|little%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: in another corner. There was|be%2:42:00:: no garret|garret%1:06:00:: at 
all, and no cellar--except a small|small%3:00:00:: hole, dug|dig%2:35:01:: in the ground, called|call%2:32:02:: a 
cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: cellar, where the family|family%1:14:02:: could go|go%2:38:00:: in case|case%1:26:00:: one of those great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
whirlwinds|whirlwind%1:19:00:: arose, mighty|mighty%4:02:00:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 to crush|crush%2:30:00:: any building|building%1:06:00:: in its path. It 
was|be%2:42:03:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: by a trap-door in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the floor, from which a 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into the small, dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. 
 
When Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the doorway|doorway%1:06:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: around, she could see|see%2:39:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairie|prairie%1:15:00:: on every side. Not|not%4:02:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: nor a 
house|house%1:14:03:: broke|break%2:38:01:: the broad|broad%3:00:04:: sweep|sweep%1:07:00:: of flat|flat%3:00:00:even:01 country|country%1:15:01:: that reached|reach%2:38:00:: the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: in all directions. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: baked|baked%3:00:00:dry:01 the plowed|plow%2:36:00:: land|land%1:17:01:: into a 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 mass, with little|little%3:00:01:: cracks|crack%1:17:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through it. Even|even%4:02:00:: the grass|grass%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: green, for the sun|sun%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: burned|burn%2:30:02:: the tops|top%1:15:01:: of the long|long%3:00:01:: blades|blade%1:20:00:: until 
they were|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:02:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. Once the house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: painted, but the sun|sun%1:17:00:: blistered|blister%2:30:01:: the paint|paint%1:06:00:: and the rains|rain%1:19:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: it 
away, and now|now%4:02:05:: the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: as dull|dull%3:00:00:unsaturated:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as everything else. 
 
 
When Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: came|come%2:38:04:: there|there%4:02:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: she was|be%2:42:03:: a young, pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 wife. The 
sun|sun%1:19:00:: and wind|wind%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: changed|change%2:30:01:: her, too. They had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the sparkle|sparkle%1:07:01:: from 
her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and left|leave%2:42:02:: them a sober|sober%3:00:00:serious:00 gray; they had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: the red|red%1:07:00:: from her 
cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: and lips, and they were|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 also. She was|be%2:42:03:: thin|thin%3:00:03:: and gaunt, 
and never|never%4:02:00:: smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: an orphan, first|first%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:04:: 
to her, Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: by the child's laughter|laughter%1:10:00:: that 
she would scream|scream%2:32:01:: and press|press%2:35:00:: her hand|hand%1:08:00:: upon her heart|heart%1:09:00:: whenever Dorothy's 
merry|merry%3:00:02:joyous:00 voice|voice%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: her ears; and she still|still%4:02:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: that she could find|find%2:40:02:: anything to laugh|laugh%1:10:00:: at. 
 
Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: laughed. He worked|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: from morning|morning%1:28:00:: till night|night%1:28:00:: and 
did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: what joy|joy%1:12:00:: was. He was|be%2:42:03:: gray|gray%3:00:00:old:02 also, from his long|long%3:00:01:: beard|beard%1:08:00:: to 
his rough|rough%3:00:00:: boots, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: stern|stern%3:00:00:implacable:00 and solemn, and rarely|rarely%4:02:00:: spoke. 
 
It was|be%2:42:06:: Toto that made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy laugh, and saved|save%2:41:01:: her from growing|grow%2:30:00:: as 
gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 as her other|other%3:00:00:: surroundings. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: gray; he was|be%2:42:03:: a little|little%3:00:01:: 
black|black%3:00:01:: dog, with long, silky|silky%3:00:00:bright:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and small|small%3:00:00:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that twinkled|twinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on either side|side%1:15:02:: of his funny, wee nose. Toto played|play%2:41:03:: all day|day%1:28:00:: 
long, and Dorothy played|play%2:41:03:: with him, and loved|love%2:37:00:: him dearly. 
 
 
 
To-day, however, they were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: playing. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: upon the 
door-step and looked|look%2:39:00:: anxiously|anxiously%4:02:00:: at the sky, which was|be%2:42:03:: even|even%4:02:00:: grayer|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 than 
usual. Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the door|door%1:06:01:: with Toto in her arms, and looked|look%2:39:00:: at 
the sky|sky%1:17:00:: too. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: washing|wash%2:35:00:: the dishes. 
 
From the far|far%3:00:00:: north|north%1:24:00:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 wail|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, and Uncle|uncle%1:18:01:: 
Henry|henry%1:23:00:: and Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: where the long|long%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: in waves|wave%1:11:01:: 
before the coming|come%2:30:01:: storm. There now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:30:01:: a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 whistling|whistling%1:11:00:: in the 
air|air%1:27:00:: from the south, and as they turned|turn%2:38:00:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that way|way%1:15:00:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: 
ripples|ripple%1:11:00:: in the grass|grass%1:20:00:: coming|come%2:38:00:: from that direction|direction%1:15:00:: also. 
 
Suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up. 
 
"There's a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: coming, Em," he called|call%2:32:09:: to his wife; "I'll go|go%2:38:00:: look|look%1:04:00:: 
after the stock." Then|then%4:02:00:: he ran|run%2:38:00:: toward the sheds|shed%1:06:00:: where the cows|cow%1:05:01:: and 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: kept. 
 
Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: dropped|drop%2:30:01:: her work|work%1:04:00:: and came|come%2:38:00:: to the door. One glance|glance%1:04:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: her of 
the danger|danger%1:26:00:: close|close%1:28:00:: at hand. 
 
"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed; "run for the cellar!" 
 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: out of Dorothy's arms|arm%1:08:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: under the bed, and the 
girl|girl%1:18:02:: started|start%2:30:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him. Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, badly|badly%4:02:02:: frightened, threw|throw%2:35:00:: open|open%3:00:01:: the 
trap-door in the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: into the small, 
dark|dark%3:00:01:: hole. Dorothy caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto at last, and started|start%2:30:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: her 
aunt. When she was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%3:00:00:incomplete:00 way|way%1:15:00:: across the room|room%1:06:00:: there came|come%2:30:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 shriek|shriek%1:10:00:: 
from the wind, and the house|house%1:06:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:00:strong:00 that she lost|lose%2:40:02:: her footing|footing%1:26:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: upon the floor. 
 
A strange|strange%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: happened. 
 
The house|house%1:06:00:: whirled|whirl%2:38:01:: around two or three times|time%1:11:00:: and rose|rise%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: through 
the air. Dorothy felt|feel%2:29:00:: as if she were|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. 
 
The north|north%1:24:00:: and south|south%1:24:00:: winds|wind%1:19:00:: met|meet%2:42:02:: where the house|house%1:06:00:: stood, and made|make%2:36:00:: it the 
exact|exact%3:00:00:: center|center%1:15:01:: of the cyclone. In the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:26:00:: the air|air%1:27:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
generally|generally%4:02:02:: still, but the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pressure|pressure%1:07:00:: of the wind|wind%1:19:00:: on every side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the house|house%1:06:00:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: it up|up%4:02:00:: higher|high%3:00:01:: and higher, until it was|be%2:42:03:: at the very|very%4:02:00:: 
top|top%1:15:00:: of the cyclone; and there it remained|remain%2:42:01:: and was|be%2:42:05:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: and 
miles|mile%1:23:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as you could carry|carry%2:35:02:: a feather. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: dark, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: howled|howl%2:32:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: around her, but 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:10:: she was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. After the first|first%3:00:00:: few|few%3:00:00:: whirls|whirl%1:25:00:: 
around, and one other|other%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: tipped|tip%2:40:00:: badly, she felt|feel%2:37:00:: as 
if she were|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: rocked|rock%2:38:00:: gently, like a baby|baby%1:18:00:: in a cradle. 
 
Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it. He ran|run%2:38:00:: about the room, now|now%4:02:05:: here, now|now%4:02:05:: there, 
barking|bark%2:32:00:: loudly; but Dorothy sat|sit%2:35:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: still|still%4:02:02:: on the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: 
to see|see%2:31:08:: what would happen. 
 
Once Toto got|get%2:30:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: near the open|open%3:00:01:: trap-door, and fell|fall%2:38:03:: in; and at first|first%3:00:00:: 
the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she had|have%2:39:06:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: him. But soon|soon%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: one of his 
ears|ear%1:08:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: through the hole, for the strong|strong%3:00:00:: pressure|pressure%1:19:00:: of the air|air%1:27:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: keeping|keep%2:42:00:: him up|up%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:06:: that he could not|not%4:02:00:: fall. She crept|creep%2:38:00:: to the hole, 
caught|catch%2:35:01:: Toto by the ear, and dragged|drag%2:35:00:: him into the room|room%1:06:00:: again; afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: 
closing|close%2:35:00:: the trap-door so that no more|more%3:00:02:: accidents|accident%1:11:01:: could happen. 
 
Hour|hour%1:28:00:: after hour|hour%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: away, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: Dorothy got|get%2:30:00:: over her fright; 
but she felt|feel%2:37:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: lonely, and the wind|wind%1:19:00:: shrieked|shriek%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: all about 
her that she nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: deaf. At first|first%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: if she 
would be|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:38:00:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: when the house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:40:05:: again; but as the hours|hour%1:28:01:: 
passed|pass%2:38:03:: and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 happened, she stopped|stop%2:42:00:: worrying|worry%2:37:00:: and 
resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: calmly|calmly%4:02:00:: and see|see%2:31:08:: what the future|future%1:28:00:: would bring. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 
she crawled|crawl%2:38:00:: over the swaying|sway%2:38:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: to her bed, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon it; 
and Toto followed|follow%2:38:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside her. 
 
In spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the swaying of the house|house%1:06:00:: and the wailing|wail%2:32:00:: of the wind, 
Dorothy soon|soon%4:02:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: asleep. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: II. 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by a shock, so|so%4:02:02:: sudden|sudden%3:00:00:: and severe|severe%3:00:00:strong:00 that if Dorothy 
had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: she might have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: hurt. As it 
was, the jar|jar%1:06:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: her catch|catch%2:40:00:: her breath|breath%1:27:00:: and wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: what had|have%2:40:00:: happened; 
and Toto put|put%2:35:00:: his cold|cold%3:00:02:: little|little%3:00:01:: nose|nose%1:08:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: and whined|whine%2:32:01:: dismally. 
Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: that the house|house%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: moving; nor was|be%2:42:03:: it 
dark, for the bright|bright%3:00:00:light:06 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: at the window, flooding|flood%2:35:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: room. She sprang|spring%2:38:01:: from her bed|bed%1:06:00:: and with Toto at her heels|heel%1:08:00:: ran|run%2:38:08:: 
and opened|open%2:35:00:: the door. 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a cry|cry%1:10:00:: of amazement|amazement%1:12:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: about her, her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: and bigger|big%3:00:01:: at the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sights|sight%1:10:00:: she saw. 
 
The cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: down, very|very%4:02:00:: gently--for a cyclone--in 
the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a country|country%1:15:00:: of marvelous|marvelous%3:00:00:incredible:00 beauty. There were|be%2:42:04:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 patches|patch%1:06:00:: 
of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sward|sward%1:17:00:: all about, with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 trees|tree%1:20:00:: bearing|bear%2:36:00:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and 
luscious|luscious%3:00:00:sexy:00 fruits. Banks|bank%1:17:00:: of gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: on every hand, and 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: with rare|rare%3:00:00:scarce:00 and brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 plumage|plumage%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: and fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: in the trees|tree%1:20:00:: 
and bushes. A|a%1:08:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: was|be%2:42:04:: a small|small%3:00:00:: brook, rushing|rush%2:30:00:: and sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 
along between green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 banks, and murmuring|murmur%2:32:00:: in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to 
a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: on the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 prairies. 
 
While she stood|stand%2:35:00:: looking|look%2:39:00:: eagerly|eagerly%4:02:00:: at the strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: sights, 
she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: coming|come%2:38:00:: toward her a group|group%1:03:00:: of the queerest|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 people|people%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: seen. They were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as the grown|grown%3:00:00:mature:01 folk|folk%1:14:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
used|use%2:34:02:: to; but neither were|be%2:42:03:: they very|very%4:02:00:: small. In fact, they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: about 
as|as%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: as Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: a well-grown child|child%1:18:00:: for her age, although 
they were, so|so%4:02:07:: far|far%4:02:00:: as looks|look%1:07:00:: go, many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: older. 
 
 
 
Three were|be%2:42:03:: men|man%1:18:00:: and one a woman, and all were|be%2:42:03:: oddly|oddly%4:02:00:: dressed. They wore|wear%2:29:00:: 
round|round%1:04:03:: hats|hat%1:06:00:: that rose|rise%2:38:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: point|point%1:25:00:: a foot|foot%1:23:00:: above their heads, with 
little|little%3:00:01:: bells|bell%1:06:00:: around the brims|brim%1:06:00:: that tinkled|tinkle%2:39:00:: sweetly|sweetly%4:02:00:: as they moved. The 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: of the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: blue; the little|little%3:00:01:: woman's hat|hat%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: white, and she 
wore|wear%2:29:00:: a white|white%3:00:01:: gown|gown%1:06:00:: that hung|hang%2:35:00:: in plaits|plait%1:08:00:: from her shoulders; over it were|be%2:42:03:: 
sprinkled|sprinkle%2:35:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: stars|star%1:17:01:: that glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: like diamonds. The men|man%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in blue, of the same|same%3:00:02:: shade|shade%1:07:00:: as their hats, and wore|wear%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: 
polished|polished%3:00:00:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with a deep|deep%3:00:00:colorful:00 roll|roll%1:25:00:: of blue|blue%1:07:00:: at the tops. The men, Dorothy 
thought, were|be%2:42:03:: about as|as%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: as Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry, for two of them had|have%2:40:00:: beards. 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: doubtless much|much%3:00:00:: older: her face|face%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: 
with wrinkles, her hair|hair%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: white, and she walked|walk%2:38:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: stiffly. 
 
When these people|people%1:14:00:: drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the house|house%1:06:00:: where Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: in 
the doorway, they paused|pause%2:32:01:: and whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: among themselves, as if afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: farther. But the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to Dorothy, made|make%2:32:00:: 
a low|low%3:00:01:: bow|bow%1:10:01:: and said, in a sweet|sweet%3:00:00:melodious:00 voice, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: welcome, most|most%4:02:00:: noble|noble%3:00:01:: Sorceress, to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins. 
We are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for having|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and for setting|set%2:30:01:: our people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage." 
 
 
 
Dorothy listened|listen%2:39:00:: to this speech|speech%1:10:01:: with wonder. What could the little|little%3:00:01:: 
woman|woman%1:18:00:: possibly|possibly%4:02:00:: mean|mean%2:32:01:: by calling|call%2:32:02:: her a sorceress, and saying|say%2:32:00:: she 
had|have%2:41:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East? Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: an innocent, 
harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: by a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
from home; and she had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything in all her life. 
 
But the little|little%3:00:01:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: expected|expect%2:32:00:: her to answer; so Dorothy 
said, with hesitation, 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind; but there must be|be%2:42:00:: some mistake. I have|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:42:00:: 
anything." 
 
"Your house|house%1:06:00:: did, anyway," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, with a laugh; 
"and that is|be%2:42:06:: the same|same%3:00:02:: thing. See!" she continued, pointing|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:15:02:: of the house; "there are|be%2:42:04:: her two toes, still|still%4:02:01:: sticking|stick%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: from 
under a block|block%1:06:00:: of wood." 
 
Dorothy looked, and gave|give%2:41:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fright. There, indeed, just|just%4:02:01:: 
under the corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beam|beam%1:06:00:: the house|house%1:06:00:: rested|rest%2:35:00:: on, two feet|foot%1:23:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out, shod in silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: with pointed|pointed%3:00:00:: toes. 
 
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clasping|clasp%2:35:00:: her hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: in 
dismay; "the house|house%1:06:00:: must have|have%2:29:02:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on her. What ever|ever%4:02:04:: shall we do?" 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to be|be%2:42:00:: done," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman, calmly. 
 
 
 
"But who was|be%2:42:06:: she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East, as I said," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "She has|have%2:40:00:: held|hold%2:42:00:: all the Munchkins in bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: for many|many%3:00:00:: 
years, making|make%2:36:00:: them slave|slave%1:18:00:: for her night|night%1:28:00:: and day. Now|now%1:28:00:: they are|be%2:42:03:: all set|set%1:14:00:: 
free, and are|be%2:42:03:: grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you for the favour." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Munchkins?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in this land|land%1:15:02:: of the East, where the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:intense:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: ruled." 
 
"Are you a Munchkin?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but I am|be%2:42:06:: their friend, although I live|live%2:42:08:: in the land|land%1:15:01:: of the North. 
When they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: the Munchkins sent|send%2:38:01:: a swift|swift%1:05:00:: 
messenger|messenger%1:18:00:: to me, and I came|come%2:38:00:: at once. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North." 
 
"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy; "are you a real|real%3:00:00:: witch?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: woman. "But I am|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: witch, and 
the people|people%1:14:01:: love|love%2:37:01:: me. I am|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: who 
ruled|rule%2:41:00:: here, or I should have|have%2:41:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: free|free%3:00:00:: myself." 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:01:: all witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: wicked," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: half|half%1:23:00:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at facing|face%2:32:00:: a real|real%3:00:00:: witch. 
 
"Oh, no; that is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake. There were|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: four witches|witch%1:18:03:: in all 
the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz, and two of them, those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:00:: and the 
South, are|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: witches. I know|know%2:31:02:: this is|be%2:42:03:: true, for I am|be%2:42:06:: one of them 
myself, and cannot be|be%2:42:03:: mistaken. Those who dwelt|dwell%2:42:00:: in the East|east%1:15:00:: and the 
West|west%1:15:01:: were, indeed, wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witches; but now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: one 
of them, there is|be%2:42:00:: but one wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz--the one|one%1:23:00:: 
who lives|live%2:42:06:: in the West." 
 
"But," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em|em%1:23:01:: has|have%2:40:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: me 
that the witches|witch%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all dead--years and years|year%1:28:01:: ago." 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em?" inquired|inquire%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman. 
 
"She is|be%2:42:06:: my aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: who lives|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, where I came|come%2:42:09:: from." 
 
The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: for a time, with her head|head%1:08:00:: 
bowed|bow%2:38:00:: and her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: upon the ground. Then|then%4:02:00:: she looked|look%2:39:00:: up and said, 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: where Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: is, for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: that country|country%1:15:00:: 
mentioned|mention%2:32:00:: before. But tell|tell%2:32:00:: me, is|be%2:42:03:: it a civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: country?" 
 
"Oh, yes;" replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then that accounts|account%2:42:01:: for it. In|in%1:15:00:: the civilized|civilized%3:00:00:: countries|country%1:14:00:: I believe|believe%2:31:04:: 
there are|be%2:42:00:: no witches|witch%1:18:00:: left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor 
magicians. But, you see, the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz has|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: civilized, for 
we are|be%2:42:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: from all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the world. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: we still|still%4:02:01:: 
have|have%2:32:00:: witches|witch%1:18:00:: and wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: amongst us." 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: the Wizards?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oz himself is|be%2:42:06:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Witch, sinking|sink%2:38:02:: her 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: to a whisper. "He is|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: than all the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of us 
together. He lives|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:02:: another question, but just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: the Munchkins, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: by, gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: shout|shout%1:10:00:: and pointed|point%2:32:00:: to the 
corner|corner%1:06:00:: of the house|house%1:06:00:: where the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: lying. 
 
 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman; and looked, and began|begin%2:30:01:: 
to laugh. The feet|foot%1:08:01:: of the dead|dead%3:00:01:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: disappeared|disappear%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: and 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:42:03:: but the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes. 
 
"She was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: old," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the North, "that she dried|dry%2:30:01:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: quickly|quickly%4:02:00:: in the sun. That is|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of her. But the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: yours, and you shall have|have%2:40:00:: them to wear." She reached|reach%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and 
picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the shoes, and after shaking|shake%2:38:00:: the dust|dust%1:27:00:: out of them handed|hand%2:40:00:: 
them to Dorothy. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of those silver|silver%3:00:00:metallic:00 shoes," said|say%2:32:00:: one of 
the Munchkins; "and there is|be%2:42:03:: some charm|charm%1:07:00:: connected|connect%2:31:00:: with them; but what 
it is|be%2:42:06:: we never|never%4:02:00:: knew." 
 
Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: into the house|house%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: them on the 
table. Then|then%4:02:00:: she came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: to the Munchkins and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: and Uncle, for I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they 
will worry|worry%2:37:00:: about me. Can you help|help%2:41:00:: me find|find%2:40:00:: my way?" 
 
The Munchkins and the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: first|first%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at one another, and then|then%4:02:00:: at 
Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads. 
 
"At the East, not|not%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from here," said|say%2:32:00:: one, "there is|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert, 
and none|none%1:28:00:: could live|live%2:42:04:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the South," said|say%2:32:00:: another, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there 
and seen|see%2:39:02:: it. The South|south%1:15:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings." 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: told," said|say%2:32:00:: the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 man, "that it is|be%2:42:03:: the same|same%3:00:00:: at the West. And 
that country, where the Winkies live, is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the West, who would make|make%2:30:00:: you her slave|slave%1:18:00:: if you passed|pass%2:38:05:: her way." 
 
"The North|north%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my home," said|say%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: lady, "and at its edge|edge%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: the 
same|same%3:00:02:: great|great%3:00:01:large:00 desert|desert%1:15:00:: that surrounds|surround%2:35:00:: this land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: I'm afraid, my 
dear, you will have|have%2:39:06:: to live|live%2:42:08:: with us." 
 
Dorothy began|begin%2:30:00:: to sob, at this, for she felt|feel%2:37:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 among all 
these strange|strange%3:00:00:: people. Her tears|tear%1:08:01:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to grieve|grieve%2:37:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 
Munchkins, for they immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: their handkerchiefs|handkerchief%1:06:00:: and 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep also. As for the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her 
cap|cap%1:06:00:: and balanced|balance%2:35:00:: the point|point%1:25:00:: on the end|end%1:15:00:: of her nose, while she counted|count%2:32:00:: 
"one, two, three" in a solemn|solemn%3:00:00:serious:00 voice. At once|once%4:02:02:: the cap|cap%1:06:00:: changed|change%2:30:00:: to a 
slate, on which was|be%2:42:05:: written|write%2:36:01:: in big, white|white%3:00:01:: chalk|chalk%1:06:00:: marks: 
 
"LET DOROTHY GO|go%1:06:00:: TO THE CITY|city%1:15:00:: OF EMERALDS." 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: the slate|slate%1:06:00:: from her nose, and, having|have%2:40:00:: read|read%2:31:00:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: on it, asked, 
 
"Is your name|name%1:10:00:: Dorothy, my dear?" 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child, looking|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:01:: her tears. 
 
"Then you must go|go%2:38:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: this City?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:05:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the center|center%1:15:01:: of the country, and is|be%2:42:05:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by Oz, the 
Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: I told|tell%2:32:01:: you of." 
 
"Is he a good|good%3:00:01:: man?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"He is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Wizard. Whether he is|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: or not|not%4:02:00:: I cannot tell, for I 
have|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: there?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"You must walk. It is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, through a country|country%1:15:02:: that is|be%2:42:03:: 
sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: dark|dark%3:00:00:evil:00 and terrible. However, I will 
use|use%2:34:01:: all the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: I know|know%2:31:03:: of to keep|keep%2:41:01:: you from harm." 
 
"Won't you go|go%2:38:00:: with me?" pleaded|plead%2:32:00:: the girl, who had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon 
the little|little%3:00:01:: old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: as her only|only%3:00:00:single:05 friend. 
 
"No, I cannot do|do%2:36:01:: that," she replied; "but I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my kiss, 
and no one will|will%1:09:01:: dare injure|injure%2:29:00:: a person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: by the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
of the North." 
 
She came|come%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy and kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:01:: on the forehead. 
Where her lips|lip%1:08:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:02:: they left|leave%2:42:00:: a round, shining|shin%2:38:00:: mark, as 
Dorothy found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:02:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds|emerald%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Witch; "so you cannot miss|miss%2:39:00:: it. When you get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of 
him, but tell|tell%2:32:01:: your story|story%1:10:03:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to help|help%2:41:00:: you. Good-bye, my dear." 
 
 
 
The three Munchkins bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to her and wished|wish%2:32:00:: her a pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: 
journey, after which they walked|walk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: through the trees. The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
gave|give%2:40:07:: Dorothy a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: little|little%3:00:01:: nod, whirled|whirl%2:38:04:: around|around%4:02:09:: on her left|leave%2:38:01:: heel|heel%1:06:02:: 
three times, and straightway disappeared, much|much%3:00:00:: to the surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: of 
little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, who barked|bark%2:32:01:: after her loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: gone, 
because he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: to growl|growl%2:32:00:: while she stood|stand%2:35:00:: by. 
 
But Dorothy, knowing|know%2:31:01:: her to be|be%2:42:06:: a witch, had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: her to disappear|disappear%2:30:00:: 
in just|just%4:02:05:: that way, and was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: in the least. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: III. 
 
 
When Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:30:02:: alone|alone%4:02:01:: she began|begin%2:30:00:: to feel|feel%2:29:00:: hungry. So she went|go%2:38:00:: 
to the cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: herself some bread, which she spread|spread%2:42:00:: with 
butter. She gave|give%2:40:00:: some to Toto, and taking|take%2:35:00:: a pail|pail%1:06:00:: from the shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: 
she carried|carry%2:35:02:: it down|down%4:02:00:: to the little|little%3:00:01:: brook|brook%1:17:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with clear, 
sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:: water. Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark|bark%2:32:00:: at the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: there. Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to get|get%2:35:03:: him, and saw|saw%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 
fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: hanging|hanging%1:04:01:: from the branches|branch%1:20:00:: that she gathered|gather%2:35:00:: some of it, finding|finding%1:04:00:: 
it just|just%4:02:00:: what she wanted|want%2:37:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: her breakfast. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the house, and having|have%2:41:00:: helped|help%2:34:00:: herself and Toto 
to a good|good%3:00:01:: drink|drink%1:04:01:: of the cool, clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, she set|set%2:30:01:: about making|make%2:30:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: 
for the journey|journey%1:04:00:: to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Emeralds. 
 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one other|other%3:00:00:: dress, but that happened|happen%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: and 
was|be%2:42:03:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: on a peg|peg%2:35:00:: beside her bed. It was|be%2:42:03:: gingham, with checks|check%1:21:00:: 
of white|white%3:00:01:: and blue; and although the blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: somewhat|somewhat%4:02:01:: faded|fade%2:30:01:: with 
many|many%3:00:00:: washings, it was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frock. The girl|girl%1:18:00:: washed|wash%2:29:00:: herself 
carefully, dressed|dress%2:29:00:: herself in the clean|clean%3:00:01:: gingham, and tied|tie%2:35:00:: her pink|pink%1:07:00:: 
sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: on her head. She took|take%2:40:05:: a little|little%3:00:01:: basket|basket%1:06:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: it with 
bread|bread%1:13:00:: from the cupboard, laying|lay%2:35:01:: a white|white%3:00:01:: cloth|cloth%1:06:00:: over the top. Then|then%4:02:00:: she 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at her feet|foot%1:08:01:: and noticed|notice%2:39:04:: how old|old%3:00:02:: and worn|wear%2:30:00:: her shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: were. 
 
"They surely|surely%4:02:00:: will never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: journey, Toto," she said. And 
Toto looked|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: into her face|face%1:08:00:: with his little|little%3:00:01:: black|black%3:00:01:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and wagged|wag%2:38:00:: 
his tail|tail%1:05:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: he knew|know%2:31:03:: what she meant. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: on the table|table%1:06:01:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that 
had|have%2:42:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East. 
 
"I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if they will fit|fit%2:30:01:: me," she said|say%2:32:00:: to Toto. "They would be|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:01:: 
the thing|thing%1:26:00:: to take|take%2:39:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: in, for they could not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:03:: out." 
 
She took|take%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: her old|old%3:00:01:: leather|leather%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and tried|try%2:29:00:: on the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 ones, 
which fitted|fit%2:42:05:: her as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as if they had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for her. 
 
Finally|finally%4:02:02:: she picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket. 
 
"Come along, Toto," she said, "we will go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz how to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again." 
 
She closed|close%2:35:00:: the door, locked|lock%2:35:00:: it, and put|put%2:35:00:: the key|key%1:06:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in the 
pocket|pocket%1:06:00:: of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting|trot%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: soberly|soberly%4:02:00:: behind 
her, she started|start%2:30:01:: on her journey. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 roads|road%1:06:00:: near by, but it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:40:06:: her long|long%3:00:02:: to 
find|find%2:40:01:: the one|one%1:23:00:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. Within a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: she was|be%2:42:03:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: briskly|briskly%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald City, her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: tinkling|tinkle%2:39:00:: 
merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: on the hard, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 roadbed. The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: and the 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: sang|sing%2:36:00:: sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 and Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:37:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: as you might 
think|think%2:31:01:: a little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: would who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: whisked|whisk%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from her 
own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 country|country%1:15:00:: and set|set%2:36:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: surprised, as she walked|walk%2:38:00:: along, to see|see%2:39:00:: how pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: about her. There were|be%2:42:04:: neat|neat%3:00:00:tidy:00 fences|fence%1:06:00:: at the sides|side%1:15:02:: of the road, 
painted|paint%2:35:00:: a dainty|dainty%3:00:00:delicate:00 blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color, and beyond them were|be%2:42:04:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of grain|grain%1:20:00:: and 
vegetables|vegetable%1:20:00:: in abundance. Evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: the Munchkins were|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: farmers|farmer%1:18:00:: 
and able|able%3:00:00:: to raise|raise%2:36:03:: large|large%3:00:00:: crops. Once|once%4:02:00:: in a while|while%1:28:00:: she would pass|pass%2:30:11:: a 
house, and the people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to look|look%2:39:00:: at her and bow|bow%2:38:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: as she 
went|go%2:38:00:: by; for everyone knew|know%2:31:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: the means|mean%1:09:00:: of destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch|witch%1:18:01:: and setting|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: from bondage. The houses|house%1:06:00:: of the 
Munchkins were|be%2:42:06:: odd|odd%3:00:00:strange:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: dwellings, for each was|be%2:42:03:: round, with a big|big%3:00:01:: 
dome|dome%1:06:00:: for a roof. All were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: blue, for in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the 
East|east%3:00:00:: blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:popular:00 color. 
 
Towards evening, when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: with her long|long%3:00:02:: walk|walk%1:04:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: 
to wonder|wonder%2:32:01:: where she should pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night, she came|come%2:38:04:: to a house|house%1:06:00:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: 
larger|large%3:00:00:: than the rest. On the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lawn|lawn%1:15:00:: before it many|many%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: and women|woman%1:18:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: dancing. Five little|little%3:00:01:: fiddlers|fiddler%1:18:00:: played|play%2:36:12:: as|as%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: as possible|possible%3:00:00:: and 
the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: laughing|laughing%3:00:00:happy:00 and singing, while a big|big%3:00:01:: table|table%1:06:01:: near by was|be%2:42:03:: 
loaded|load%2:35:01:: with delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits|fruit%1:20:00:: and nuts, pies|pie%1:13:00:: and cakes, and many|many%3:00:00:: other|other%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat. 
 
The people|people%1:14:00:: greeted|greet%2:32:00:: Dorothy kindly, and invited|invite%2:41:00:: her to supper|supper%1:13:00:: and to 
pass|pass%2:41:11:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with them; for this was|be%2:42:06:: the home|home%1:15:04:: of one of the richest|rich%3:00:00:: 
Munchkins in the land, and his friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gathered|gather%2:41:00:: with him to 
celebrate|celebrate%2:41:00:: their freedom|freedom%1:26:00:: from the bondage|bondage%1:26:00:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 witch. 
 
Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:00:wholesome:00 supper|supper%1:13:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: waited|wait%2:31:00:: upon by the rich|rich%3:00:00:: Munchkin 
himself, whose name|name%1:10:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: Boq. Then|then%4:02:00:: she sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon a settee|settee%1:06:00:: and 
watched|watch%2:39:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: dance. 
 
When Boq saw|saw%2:35:00:: her silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he said, 
 
"You must be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 sorceress." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Because you wear|wear%2:29:00:: silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: and have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: witch. 
Besides, you have|have%2:40:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: in your frock, and only|only%3:00:00:single:05 witches|witch%1:18:03:: and 
sorceresses|sorceress%1:18:00:: wear|wear%2:29:00:: white." 
 
 
 
"My dress|dress%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: checked," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, smoothing|smooth%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the 
wrinkles|wrinkle%1:25:00:: in it. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to wear|wear%2:29:00:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Boq. "Blue is|be%2:42:06:: the color|color%1:07:00:: of 
the Munchkins, and white|white%3:00:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the witch|witch%1:18:01:: color; so we know|know%2:31:02:: you are|be%2:42:06:: a 
friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: witch." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: what to say|say%2:32:00:: to this, for all the people|people%1:14:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
to think|think%2:31:01:: her a witch, and she knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: an ordinary|ordinary%3:00:02:common:01 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: by the chance|chance%1:19:00:: of a cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: into a strange|strange%3:00:00:: land. 
 
When she had|have%2:39:06:: tired|tire%2:29:00:: watching|watch%2:39:05:: the dancing, Boq led|lead%2:38:01:: her into the house, 
where he gave|give%2:40:00:: her a room|room%1:06:00:: with a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 bed|bed%1:06:00:: in it. The sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
made|make%2:42:05:: of blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cloth, and Dorothy slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: in them till morning, 
with Toto curled|curl%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: on the blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rug|rug%1:06:00:: beside her. 
 
She ate|eat%2:34:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 breakfast, and watched|watch%2:39:05:: a wee Munchkin baby, who 
played|play%2:41:03:: with Toto and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: and crowed|crow%2:32:02:: and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: in a way|way%1:07:01:: 
that greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: amused|amuse%2:41:00:: Dorothy. Toto was|be%2:42:03:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 curiosity|curiosity%1:09:00:: to all the 
people, for they had|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:38:00:: a dog|dog%1:05:00:: before. 
 
"How far|far%4:02:04:: is|be%2:42:03:: it to the Emerald City?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked. 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Boq, gravely, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: there. 
It is|be%2:42:03:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 for people|people%1:14:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Oz, unless they have|have%2:40:00:: 
business|business%1:04:00:: with him. But it is|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: way|way%1:06:00:: to the Emerald City, and it 
will take|take%2:40:06:: you many|many%3:00:00:: days. The country|country%1:15:01:: here|here%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and pleasant, but 
you must pass|pass%2:38:00:: through rough|rough%3:00:00:: and dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: places|place%1:15:00:: before you reach|reach%2:38:00:: the 
end|end%1:11:00:: of your journey." 
 
This worried|worried%3:00:00:troubled:00 Dorothy a little, but she knew|know%2:31:02:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz 
could help|help%2:41:00:: her get|get%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again, so she bravely|bravely%4:02:00:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
turn|turn%2:38:00:: back. 
 
She bade|bid%2:32:01:: her friends|friend%1:18:00:: good-bye, and again|again%4:02:00:: started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: of 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. When she had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 miles|mile%1:23:01:: she thought|think%2:31:03:: she would 
stop|stop%2:38:00:: to rest, and so|so%4:02:05:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the fence|fence%1:06:00:: beside the road|road%1:06:00:: 
and sat|sit%2:38:00:: down. There was|be%2:42:04:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: beyond the fence, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
far|far%4:02:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: she saw|saw%2:35:00:: a Scarecrow, placed|place%2:35:00:: high|high%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: the birds|bird%1:05:00:: 
from the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: corn. 
 
Dorothy leaned|lean%2:38:00:: her chin|chin%1:08:00:: upon her hand|hand%1:08:00:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow. Its head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a small|small%3:00:00:: sack|sack%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, with eyes, 
nose|nose%1:06:01:: and mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: on it to represent|represent%2:32:02:: a face. An old, pointed|point%2:32:00:: 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hat, that had|have%2:40:00:: belonged|belong%2:42:06:: to some Munchkin, was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: on this 
head, and the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the figure|figure%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 suit|suit%1:06:00:: of clothes, worn|wear%2:30:00:: and 
faded, which had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. On the feet|foot%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:04:: some 
old|old%3:00:01:: boots|boot%1:06:00:: with blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tops, such|such%3:00:00:much:00 as every man|man%1:18:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: in this country, and 
the figure|figure%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: above the stalks|stalk%1:20:00:: of corn|corn%1:20:00:: by means|mean%1:09:00:: of the pole|pole%1:06:00:: 
stuck|stick%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: its back. 
 
 
 
While Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: looking|look%2:39:00:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: into the queer, painted|paint%2:35:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: of 
the Scarecrow, she was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: one of the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: wink|wink%2:39:00:: 
at her. She thought|think%2:31:03:: she must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: mistaken, at first, for none|none%1:04:00:: of 
the scarecrows|scarecrow%1:06:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: wink; but presently|presently%4:02:00:: the figure|figure%1:08:00:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: its 
head|head%1:08:00:: to her in a friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: way. Then|then%4:02:00:: she climbed|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from the fence|fence%1:06:00:: and 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to it, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around the pole|pole%1:06:00:: and barked. 
 
"Good day," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a rather|rather%4:02:04:: husky|husky%3:00:00:robust:00 voice. 
 
"Did you speak?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, in wonder. 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you do?" 
 
"I'm pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 well, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, politely; "how do|do%2:42:00:: you 
do?" 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: feeling|feel%2:29:00:: well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: tedious|tedious%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 being|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day|day%1:28:02:: to scare|scare%2:37:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: crows." 
 
"Can't you get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No, for this pole|pole%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: up|up%4:02:00:: my back. If you will please|please%2:37:01:: take|take%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: 
the pole|pole%1:06:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to you." 
 
Dorothy reached|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: both arms|arm%1:08:00:: and lifted|lift%2:38:00:: the figure|figure%1:25:00:: off the pole; for, 
being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: light. 
 
"Thank you very|very%4:02:01:: much," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: set|set%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the ground. "I feel|feel%2:29:00:: like a new|new%3:00:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: at this, for it sounded|sound%2:39:06:: queer|queer%1:18:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: 
man|man%1:18:00:: speak, and to see|see%2:39:00:: him bow|bow%2:38:00:: and walk|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside her. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when he had|have%2:40:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: himself and 
yawned, "and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" 
 
"My name|name%1:10:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: 
City, to ask|ask%2:32:01:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: the Emerald City?" he enquired; "and who is|be%2:42:06:: Oz?" 
 
"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise. 
 
"No, indeed; I|i%1:27:00:: don't know|know%2:31:01:: anything. You see, I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, so I have|have%2:40:00:: 
no brains|brain%1:09:00:: at all," he answered, sadly. 
 
 
 
"Oh," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "I'm awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: for you." 
 
"Do you think," he asked, "If I go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City|city%1:15:00:: with you, that 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz would give|give%2:40:03:: me some brains?" 
 
"I cannot tell," she returned; "but you may come|come%2:38:00:: with me, if you 
like. If Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you any brains|brain%1:09:00:: you will be|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off 
than you are|be%2:42:06:: now." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued, 
confidentially, "I don't mind|mind%2:32:00:: my legs|leg%1:08:01:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and body|body%1:08:01:: being|be%2:42:03:: stuffed, 
because I cannot get|get%2:30:00:: hurt. If anyone treads|tread%2:38:01:: on my toes|toe%1:08:01:: or sticks|stick%2:35:01:: a 
pin|pin%1:06:06:: into me, it doesn't matter, for I|i%1:27:00:: cant|cant%1:10:01:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it. But I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: to call|call%2:32:00:: me a fool, and if my head|head%1:08:00:: stays|stay%1:04:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw|straw%1:27:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:00:: of with brains, as yours is, how am|be%2:42:03:: I ever|ever%4:02:04:: to know|know%2:31:01:: anything?" 
 
"I understand|understand%2:31:00:: how you feel," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: 
sorry for him. "If you will come|come%2:38:00:: with me I'll ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to do|do%2:41:01:: all he can 
for you." 
 
"Thank you," he answered, gratefully. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, Dorothy helped|help%2:41:00:: him over the fence, and 
they started|start%2:38:02:: along the path|path%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
Toto did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: this addition|addition%1:06:00:: to the party, at first. He smelled|smell%2:39:03:: 
around the stuffed|stuff%2:30:02:: man|man%1:18:00:: as if he suspected|suspect%2:32:00:: there might be|be%2:42:00:: a nest|nest%1:17:00:: of 
rats|rat%1:05:00:: in the straw, and he often|often%4:02:00:: growled|growl%2:32:00:: in an unfriendly|unfriendly%3:00:01:: way|way%1:07:01:: at the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"Don't mind|mind%1:09:00:: Toto," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, to her new|new%3:00:00:: friend; "he never|never%4:02:00:: bites." 
 
"Oh, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: afraid," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "he can't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
straw. Do|do%1:10:01:: let|let%2:41:00:: me carry|carry%2:35:02:: that basket|basket%1:06:00:: for you. I shall not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: it, 
for I can't get|get%2:30:00:: tired. I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you a secret," he continued, as he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along; "there is|be%2:42:04:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:06:01:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "the Munchkin farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: who made|make%2:36:01:: you?" 
 
"No," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted|light%2:43:00:: match." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IV. 
 
 
After a few|few%3:00:00:: hours|hour%1:28:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: rough, and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
difficult|difficult%3:00:00:: that the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: often|often%4:02:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: over the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: here|here%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: or 
missing|miss%2:42:00:: altogether, leaving|leave%2:42:00:: holes|hole%1:17:01:: that Toto jumped|jump%2:38:00:: across and Dorothy 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: around. As for the Scarecrow, having|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%3:00:01:: ahead, and so|so%4:02:05:: stepped|step%2:38:00:: into the holes|hole%1:06:00:: and fell|fall%2:38:03:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length|length%1:07:00:: 
on the hard|hard%3:00:01:: bricks. It never|never%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: him, however, and Dorothy would 
pick|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet|foot%1:08:01:: again, while he joined|join%2:41:00:: her in 
laughing|laugh%2:29:00:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: at his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mishap. 
 
 
 
The farms|farm%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: cared|care%2:41:13:: for here|here%4:02:00:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: farther|far%4:02:00:: 
back. There were|be%2:42:00:: fewer|few%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees, and the farther|far%4:02:00:: 
they went|go%2:38:01:: the more|more%4:02:00:: dismal|dismal%3:00:00:depressing:00 and lonesome|lonesome%3:00:00:dejected:00 the country|country%1:15:01:: became. 
 
At noon|noon%1:28:00:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the roadside, near a little|little%3:00:01:: brook, and 
Dorothy opened|open%2:35:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and got|get%2:35:03:: out|out%4:02:04:: some bread. She offered|offer%2:40:00:: a piece|piece%1:21:00:: 
to the Scarecrow, but he refused. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: hungry," he said; "and it is|be%2:42:03:: a lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: not. For 
my mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: painted, and if I should cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:06:00:: in it so I could 
eat, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with would come|come%2:38:00:: out, and that would spoil|spoil%2:30:01:: 
the shape|shape%1:07:00:: of my head." 
 
Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: that this was|be%2:42:03:: true, so she only|only%4:02:02:: nodded|nod%2:32:00:: and went|go%2:38:01:: 
on eating|eat%2:34:00:: her bread. 
 
"Tell me something about yourself, and the country|country%1:15:00:: you came|come%2:42:09:: from," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, when she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: her dinner. So she told|tell%2:32:01:: 
him all about Kansas, and how gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 everything was|be%2:42:03:: there, and how 
the cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: her to this queer|queer%1:18:00:: land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
listened|listen%2:39:00:: carefully, and said, 
 
"I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: why you should wish|wish%2:37:02:: to leave|leave%2:31:05:: this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
country|country%1:15:01:: and go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the dry, gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 place|place%1:15:00:: you call|call%2:32:02:: Kansas." 
 
 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: because you have|have%2:40:00:: no brains," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. "No matter|matter%1:09:00:: 
how dreary|dreary%3:00:00:dull:03 and gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 our homes|home%1:06:00:: are, we people|people%1:14:00:: of flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: and blood|blood%1:08:00:: 
would rather|rather%4:02:01:: live|live%2:42:08:: there|there%4:02:00:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: country, be|be%2:42:03:: it ever|ever%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
beautiful. There is|be%2:42:00:: no place|place%1:15:00:: like home." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sighed. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: I cannot understand|understand%2:31:00:: it," he said. "If your heads|head%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: with straw, like mine, you would probably|probably%4:02:00:: all live|live%2:42:08:: in the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: places, and then|then%4:02:00:: Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: would have|have%2:40:00:: no people|people%1:14:00:: at all. It is|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: for Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: that you have|have%2:40:00:: brains." 
 
"Won't you tell|tell%2:32:01:: me a story, while we are|be%2:42:03:: resting?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her reproachfully, and answered, 
 
"My life|life%1:26:02:: has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: short|short%3:00:02:: that I really|really%4:02:04:: know|know%2:31:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: whatever. I was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: made|make%2:36:08:: day|day%1:28:00:: before yesterday. What happened|happen%2:30:00:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: before 
that time|time%1:28:05:: is|be%2:42:03:: all|all%4:02:00:: unknown|unknown%3:00:00:: to me. Luckily, when the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: my 
head, one of the first|first%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:04:00:: he did|do%2:41:01:: was|be%2:42:06:: to paint|paint%2:35:00:: my ears, so that I 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: what was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: on. There was|be%2:42:04:: another Munchkin with him, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:11:00:: I heard|hear%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: saying, 
 
"'How do|do%2:41:01:: you like|like%2:37:05:: those ears?' 
 
"'They aren't straight,' answered|answer%2:32:00:: the other. 
 
"'Never mind,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'they are|be%2:42:06:: ears|ear%1:08:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same,' which 
was|be%2:42:03:: true|true%3:00:00:: enough. 
 
"'Now I'll make|make%2:36:00:: the eyes,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer. So he painted|paint%2:35:00:: my right|right%1:15:00:: 
eye, and as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: I found|find%2:39:02:: myself looking|look%2:39:00:: at him and 
at everything around me with a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of curiosity, for this was|be%2:42:06:: 
my first|first%3:00:00:: glimpse|glimpse%1:04:00:: of the world. 
 
"'That's a rather|rather%4:02:04:: pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 eye,' remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Munchkin who was|be%2:42:06:: watching|watch%2:41:00:: 
the farmer; 'blue paint|paint%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: just|just%4:02:00:: the color|color%1:07:00:: for eyes.' 
 
"'I think|think%1:09:00:: I'll make|make%2:30:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: bigger,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; and 
when the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 eye|eye%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: done|do%2:41:01:: I could see|see%2:39:00:: much|much%4:02:00:: better|better%3:00:02:: than before. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: my nose|nose%1:08:00:: and my mouth; but I did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: speak, because 
at that time|time%1:28:00:: I didn't know|know%2:31:03:: what a mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: for. I had|have%2:40:00:: the fun|fun%1:04:00:: of 
watching|watch%2:39:00:: them make|make%2:36:11:: my body|body%1:08:00:: and my arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs; and when they 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: on my head, at last, I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud, for I thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: 
just|just%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as anyone. 
 
"'This fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: will scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows|crow%1:05:00:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: enough,' said|say%2:32:00:: the farmer; 'he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: like a man.' 
 
"'Why, he is|be%2:42:03:: a man,' said|say%2:32:00:: the other, and I quite|quite%4:02:01:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. The 
farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: me under his arm|arm%1:08:00:: to the cornfield, and set|set%2:35:00:: me up|up%4:02:00:: on a 
tall|tall%3:00:00:: stick, where you found|find%2:40:00:: me. He and his friend|friend%1:18:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: after|after%4:02:01:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: 
away|away%4:02:03:: and left|leave%2:30:02:: me alone. 
 
"I did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: deserted|desert%2:31:00:: this way; so I tried|try%2:41:00:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: after 
them, but my feet|foot%1:08:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the ground, and I was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:36:00:: to 
stay|stay%2:30:00:: on that pole. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lonely|lonely%3:00:00:unaccompanied:00 life|life%1:26:01:: to lead, for I had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to 
think|think%2:36:00:: of, having|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:00:: made|make%2:36:08:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: while before. Many|many%3:00:00:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the cornfield, but as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they saw|saw%2:35:00:: me they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again, thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: I was|be%2:42:06:: a Munchkin; and this pleased|please%2:37:00:: me and 
made|make%2:30:00:: me feel|feel%2:31:01:: that I was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: an important|important%3:00:00:: person. By and by an old|old%3:00:02:: 
crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: near me, and after looking|look%2:39:00:: at me carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: he perched|perch%2:38:00:: upon 
my shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
 
 
"'I wonder|wonder%1:09:00:: if that farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: thought|think%2:31:06:: to fool|fool%2:41:00:: me in this clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 manner. 
Any crow|crow%1:05:00:: of sense|sense%1:09:04:: could see|see%2:31:01:: that you are|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw.' 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he hopped|hop%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at my feet|foot%1:08:01:: and ate|eat%2:34:00:: all the corn|corn%1:20:00:: he wanted. The 
other|other%3:00:00:: birds, seeing|see%2:31:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: harmed|harm%2:29:00:: by me, came|come%2:38:04:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: the corn|corn%1:20:00:: 
too, so|so%4:02:05:: in a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of them about me." 
 
"I felt|feel%2:37:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: at this, for it showed|show%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a good|good%3:00:01:: Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
after all; but the old|old%3:00:02:: crow|crow%1:05:00:: comforted|comfort%2:37:01:: me, saying: 'If you only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head|head%1:08:00:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any of them, and a 
better|better%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: than some of them. Brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 things|thing%1:09:00:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 having|have%2:40:00:: 
in this world, no matter|matter%1:09:01:: whether one is|be%2:42:06:: a crow|crow%1:05:00:: or a man.' 
 
"After the crows|crow%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:01:: I thought|think%2:31:00:: this over, and decided|decide%2:31:00:: I would 
try|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: some brains. By good|good%3:00:01:: luck, you came|come%2:38:04:: along|along%4:02:00:: and pulled|pull%2:41:00:: 
me off the stake, and from what you say|say%2:32:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%4:02:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz will 
give|give%2:40:00:: me brains|brain%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as we get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"I hope|hope%1:12:01:: so," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly, "since you seem|seem%2:39:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to have|have%2:40:00:: 
them." 
 
"Oh yes; I am|be%2:42:03:: anxious," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "It is|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an 
uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: feeling|feeling%1:26:00:: to know|know%2:31:02:: one is|be%2:42:03:: a fool." 
 
 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "let us go." And she handed|hand%2:40:00:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: to the 
Scarecrow. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: no fences|fence%1:06:00:: at all by the road|road%1:06:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: now, and the land|land%1:21:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
rough|rough%3:00:00:: and untilled. Towards evening|evening%1:28:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and close|close%3:00:05:: together|together%4:02:02:: that their branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: over the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. It was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: dark|dark%3:00:01:: under the 
trees, for the branches|branch%1:20:00:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the daylight; but the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: stop, and went|go%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: into the forest. 
 
"If this road|road%1:06:00:: goes|go%2:42:00:: in, it must come|come%2:38:00:: out," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and as 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: at the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: of the road, we must go|go%2:38:00:: wherever 
it leads|lead%2:38:01:: us." 
 
"Anyone would know|know%2:31:01:: that," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Certainly; that is|be%2:42:06:: why I know|know%2:31:00:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "If it 
required|require%2:42:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: to figure|figure%2:31:02:: it out, I never|never%4:02:00:: should have|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: it." 
 
After an hour|hour%1:28:00:: or so|so%4:02:05:: the light|light%1:19:00:: faded|fade%2:30:02:: away, and they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
stumbling|stumble%2:38:01:: along|along%4:02:01:: in the darkness. Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: at all, 
but Toto could, for some dogs|dog%1:05:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: in the dark; and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he could see|see%2:39:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as by day. So she took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his arm, and managed|manage%2:41:08:: to get|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: fairly|fairly%4:02:02:: well. 
 
"If you see|see%2:39:00:: any house, or any place|place%1:15:00:: where we can pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night," she 
said, "you must tell|tell%2:32:04:: me; for it is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: walking|walking%1:04:00:: in the 
dark." 
 
Soon|soon%4:02:00:: after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stopped. 
 
"I see|see%2:39:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: at the right|right%1:15:00:: of us," he said, "built of logs|log%1:27:01:: 
and branches. Shall we go|go%2:38:00:: there?" 
 
"Yes, indeed;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the child. "I am|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tired%3:00:00:: out." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: her through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
cottage, and Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in one 
corner. She lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: at once, and with Toto beside her soon|soon%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
into a sound|sound%3:00:00:reasonable:00 sleep. The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: tired, stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in 
another corner|corner%1:06:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: until morning|morning%1:28:00:: came. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: V. 
 
 
When Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: shining|shin%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and Toto 
had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: out|out%4:02:04:: chasing birds|bird%1:05:00:: and squirrels. She sat|sit%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:01:: 
around her. There was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, still|still%4:02:01:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: patiently|patiently%4:02:00:: in his 
corner, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for her. 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: and search|search%2:35:00:: for water," she said|say%2:32:00:: to him. 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you want|want%2:37:00:: water?" he asked. 
 
"To wash|wash%2:29:00:: my face|face%1:08:00:: clean|clean%3:00:01:: after the dust|dust%1:27:00:: of the road, and to drink, so|so%4:02:09:: 
the dry|dry%3:00:01:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: will not|not%4:02:00:: stick|stick%2:38:00:: in my throat." 
 
"It must be|be%2:42:03:: inconvenient|inconvenient%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, 
thoughtfully; "for you must sleep, and eat|eat%2:34:00:: and drink. However, you 
have|have%2:40:00:: brains, and it is|be%2:42:03:: worth|worth%3:00:00:worthy:00 a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of bother|bother%2:41:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: 
properly." 
 
They left|leave%2:38:01:: the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they found|find%2:40:00:: a 
little|little%3:00:01:: spring|spring%1:17:00:: of clear|clear%3:00:02:: water, where Dorothy drank|drink%2:34:00:: and bathed|bath%2:29:00:: and ate|eat%2:34:01:: 
her breakfast. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: bread|bread%1:13:00:: left|leave%2:42:03:: in the basket, 
and the girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: thankful|thankful%3:00:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: anything, 
for there was|be%2:42:00:: scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: for herself and Toto for the day. 
 
When she had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:34:00:: her meal, and was|be%2:42:03:: about to go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, she was|be%2:42:03:: startled|startle%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 groan|groan%1:10:00:: near by. 
 
"What was|be%2:42:06:: that?" she asked, timidly. 
 
"I cannot imagine," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but we can go|go%2:38:00:: and see." 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: then|then%4:02:00:: another groan|groan%1:10:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: their ears, and the sound|sound%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to 
come|come%2:38:00:: from behind them. They turned|turn%2:38:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a 
few|few%3:00:00:: steps, when Dorothy discovered|discover%2:39:03:: something shining|shin%2:38:00:: in a ray|ray%1:19:00:: of 
sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: that fell|fall%2:38:00:: between the trees. She ran|run%2:38:00:: to the place, and then|then%4:02:00:: 
stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, with a cry|cry%1:10:04:: of surprise. 
 
One of the big|big%3:00:01:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: partly|partly%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: through, and standing|standing%1:04:00:: 
beside it, with an uplifted|uplifted%3:00:00:elated:00 axe|axe%1:06:00:: in his hands, was|be%2:42:04:: a man|man%1:18:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: 
of tin. His head|head%1:08:00:: and arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: jointed|joint%2:35:00:: upon his body, but he 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: motionless, as if he could not|not%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: at all. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in amazement, and so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: the Scarecrow, while 
Toto barked|bark%2:32:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: and made|make%2:41:00:: a snap|snap%1:04:00:: at the tin|tin%1:27:00:: legs, which hurt|hurt%2:39:00:: his 
teeth. 
 
"Did you groan?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the tin|tin%1:27:00:: man; "I did. I've been|be%2:42:03:: groaning|groan%2:32:00:: for more|more%3:00:01:: than 
a year, and no one|one%1:23:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: me before or come|come%2:38:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for you?" she enquired, softly, for she was|be%2:42:03:: moved|move%2:37:00:: by 
the sad|sad%3:00:00:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: in which the man|man%1:18:00:: spoke. 
 
 
 
"Get an oil-can and oil|oil%1:27:00:: my joints," he answered. "They are|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
badly|badly%4:02:02:: that I cannot move|move%2:38:01:: them at all; if I am|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: oiled|oil%2:35:00:: I shall soon|soon%4:02:00:: 
be|be%2:42:03:: all right|right%3:00:02:: again. You will find|find%2:40:02:: an oil-can on a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: in my cottage." 
 
Dorothy at once|once%4:02:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: the oil-can, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: she returned|return%2:38:00:: and asked, anxiously, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: your joints?" 
 
"Oil my neck, first," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. So she oiled|oil%2:35:00:: it, and 
as it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: took|take%2:35:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of the tin|tin%1:27:00:: head|head%1:06:00:: 
and moved|move%2:38:01:: it gently|gently%4:02:01:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: until it worked|work%2:35:02:: freely, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: could turn|turn%2:38:00:: it himself. 
 
"Now oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled|oil%2:35:00:: them and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: them carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: free|free%3:00:00:: from 
rust|rust%1:27:00:: and as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as new. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: gave|give%2:40:03:: a sigh|sigh%1:10:00:: of satisfaction|satisfaction%1:12:00:: and lowered|lower%2:38:00:: his axe, 
which he leaned|lean%2:35:00:: against the tree. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 comfort," he said. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:00:: that axe in 
the air|air%1:27:00:: ever|ever%4:02:00:: since I rusted, and I'm glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: it down|down%4:02:00:: 
at last. Now, if you will oil|oil%1:27:00:: the joints|joint%1:08:00:: of my legs, I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all 
right|right%4:02:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: more." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they oiled|oil%2:35:00:: his legs|leg%1:08:01:: until he could move|move%2:38:01:: them freely; and he 
thanked|thank%2:32:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: and again|again%4:02:00:: for his release, for he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
polite|polite%3:00:00:: creature, and very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 grateful. 
 
"I might have|have%2:41:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: there|there%4:02:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: if you had|have%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: along," he said; 
"so you have|have%2:40:00:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How did|do%2:41:01:: you happen|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:05:: here?" 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: on our way|way%1:04:02:: to the Emerald City, to see|see%2:39:02:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz," she 
answered, "and we stopped|stop%2:38:00:: at your cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:41:11:: Oz?" he asked. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: wants|want%2:37:00:: him to 
put|put%2:35:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: into his head," she replied. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: appeared|appear%2:39:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: deeply|deeply%4:02:00:: for a moment. Then|then%4:02:00:: he said: 
 
"Do you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart?" 
 
"Why, I guess|guess%1:10:00:: so," Dorothy answered; "it would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: as to give|give%2:40:00:: 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brains." 
 
 
 
"True," the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: returned. "So, if you will allow|allow%2:41:00:: me to join|join%2:41:00:: 
your party, I will also|also%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to help|help%2:41:00:: me." 
 
"Come along," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, heartily; and Dorothy added|add%2:32:01:: 
that she would be|be%2:42:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: his company. So the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
shouldered|shoulder%2:35:02:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to put|put%2:35:00:: the oil-can in her basket. 
"For," he said, "if I should get|get%2:30:00:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the rain, and rust|rust%1:22:00:: again, 
I would need|need%2:34:00:: the oil-can badly." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: their new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: join|join%2:41:00:: the party, 
for soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they had|have%2:40:00:: begun|begin%2:30:01:: their journey|journey%1:04:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a place|place%1:15:00:: 
where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and branches|branch%1:20:00:: grew|grow%2:30:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 over the road|road%1:06:00:: that the 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: could not|not%4:02:00:: pass. But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: 
and chopped|chop%2:35:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: that soon|soon%4:02:00:: he cleared|clear%2:30:02:: a passage|passage%1:06:00:: for the entire|entire%3:00:01:whole:00 party. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: as they walked|walk%2:38:00:: along that she did|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: notice|notice%2:39:04:: when the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stumbled|stumble%2:38:01:: into a hole|hole%1:17:01:: and rolled|roll%2:38:01:: over|over%4:02:01:: to 
the side|side%1:15:02:: of the road. Indeed, he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:09:: to her to help|help%2:41:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"Why didn't you walk|walk%2:38:00:: around the hole?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I don't know|know%2:31:01:: enough," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, cheerfully. "My head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: with straw, you know, and that is|be%2:42:06:: why I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to ask|ask%2:32:00:: 
him for some brains." 
 
"Oh, I see;" said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "But, after all, brains|brain%1:09:00:: are|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
the best|best%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
"Have you any?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"No, my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: empty," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "but once I had|have%2:40:00:: 
brains, and a heart|heart%1:09:00:: also; so, having|have%2:40:00:: tried|try%2:34:00:: them both, I should much|much%4:02:03:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"And why is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will know." 
 
So, while they were|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: 
the following|follow%2:42:05:: story: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: the son|son%1:18:00:: of a woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: who chopped|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: and sold|sell%2:40:00:: the wood|wood%1:27:00:: for a living. When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I too|too%4:02:01:: became|become%2:42:01:: a 
wood-chopper, and after my father|father%1:18:00:: died|die%2:30:00:: I took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:04:02:: of my old|old%3:00:02:: mother|mother%1:18:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she lived. Then|then%4:02:00:: I made|make%2:36:08:: up|up%4:02:00:: my mind|mind%1:09:04:: that instead|instead%4:02:01:: of living|live%2:42:01:: 
alone|alone%4:02:01:: I would marry, so that I might not|not%4:02:00:: become|become%2:30:00:: lonely. 
 
 
 
"There was|be%2:42:04:: one of the Munchkin girls|girl%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: that I 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: to love|love%2:37:00:: her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised|promise%2:32:00:: 
to marry|marry%2:41:00:: me as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as I could earn|earn%2:40:01:: enough|enough%3:00:00:sufficient:00 money|money%1:21:00:: to build|build%2:36:00:: a better|better%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: for her; so I set|set%2:30:01:: to work|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever. But the girl|girl%1:18:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: 
with an old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: her to marry|marry%2:41:00:: anyone, for she was|be%2:42:03:: 
so|so%4:02:02:: lazy|lazy%3:00:00:idle:00 she wished|wish%2:37:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: to remain|remain%2:42:03:: with her and do|do%2:41:01:: the cooking|cooking%1:04:00:: 
and the housework. So the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: to the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
East, and promised|promise%2:32:01:: her two sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: and a cow|cow%1:05:01:: if she would prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: the 
marriage. Thereupon the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: enchanted|enchant%2:37:00:: my axe, and when I was|be%2:42:03:: 
chopping|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:05:: at my best|best%3:00:00:: one day, for I was|be%2:42:03:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to get|get%2:40:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: 
house|house%1:06:00:: and my wife|wife%1:18:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: all at once|once%4:02:02:: 
and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my left|left%3:00:00:: leg. 
 
"This at first|first%4:02:02:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 misfortune, for I knew|know%2:31:00:: a one-legged man|man%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: do|do%2:42:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wood-chopper. So I went|go%2:38:00:: to a tin-smith 
and had|have%2:32:00:: him make|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. The leg|leg%1:08:01:: worked|work%2:35:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well, 
once|once%4:02:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to it; but my action|action%1:04:02:: angered|anger%2:37:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of 
the East, for she had|have%2:40:00:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: the old|old%3:00:02:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: I should not|not%4:02:00:: marry|marry%2:41:00:: the 
pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: Munchkin girl. When I began|begin%2:30:00:: chopping|chop%2:35:01:: again|again%4:02:00:: my axe|axe%1:06:00:: slipped|slip%2:38:01:: and 
cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my right|right%3:00:00:: leg. Again I went|go%2:38:00:: to the tinner, and again|again%4:02:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: 
me a leg|leg%1:08:01:: out of tin. After this the enchanted|enchanted%3:00:00:: axe|axe%1:06:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my arms, 
one after the other; but, nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: daunted, I had|have%2:30:00:: them replaced|replace%2:30:00:: with 
tin|tin%1:27:00:: ones. The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: and cut|cut%2:35:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: my 
head, and at first|first%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me. But the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: 
happened|happen%2:30:02:: to come|come%2:38:04:: along, and he made|make%2:36:00:: me a new|new%3:00:00:: head|head%1:08:00:: out of tin. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: beaten|beat%2:33:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: then, and I worked|work%2:41:00:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than 
ever; but I little|little%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:01:: how cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 my enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: could be. She thought|think%2:31:00:: of a 
new|new%3:00:00:: way|way%1:04:01:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: my love|love%1:12:00:: for the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Munchkin maiden, and made|make%2:30:00:: my 
axe|axe%1:06:00:: slip|slip%1:04:02:: again, so that it cut|cut%2:35:00:: right|right%4:02:09:: through my body, splitting me 
into two halves. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: the tinner|tinner%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:03:: to my help|help%1:04:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: me a 
body|body%1:08:00:: of tin, fastening|fasten%2:35:00:: my tin|tin%1:27:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: to it, by means|mean%1:09:00:: of 
joints, so that I could move|move%2:38:01:: around|around%4:02:04:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. But, alas! I had|have%2:40:00:: 
now|now%4:02:00:: no heart, so that I lost|lose%2:40:02:: all my love|love%1:12:00:: for the Munchkin girl, and did|do%2:41:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether I married|marry%2:41:00:: her or not. I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: she is|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: living|live%2:42:08:: 
with the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for me to come|come%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
 
 
"My body|body%1:08:00:: shone|shine%2:43:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: in the sun|sun%1:17:00:: that I felt|feel%2:37:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of it 
and it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: if my axe slipped, for it could not|not%4:02:00:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: me. 
There was|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: one danger--that my joints|joint%1:08:00:: would rust; but I kept|keep%2:40:01:: an 
oil-can in my cottage|cottage%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:09:00:: to oil|oil%1:27:00:: myself whenever I needed|need%2:34:00:: 
it. However, there came|come%2:30:01:: a day|day%1:28:03:: when I forgot|forget%2:31:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: this, and, being|be%2:42:06:: 
caught|catch%2:35:03:: in a rainstorm, before I thought|think%2:31:00:: of the danger|danger%1:26:01:: my joints|joint%1:08:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
rusted, and I was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: in the woods|wood%1:14:00:: until you came|come%2:38:04:: to help|help%2:41:00:: 
me. It was|be%2:42:06:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 thing|thing%1:04:00:: to undergo, but during the year|year%1:28:01:: I stood|stand%2:42:04:: 
there|there%4:02:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: that the greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 loss|loss%1:11:01:: I had|have%2:40:00:: known|know%2:31:04:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
the loss|loss%1:21:01:: of my heart. While I was|be%2:42:03:: in love|love%1:12:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: the happiest|happy%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: on 
earth; but no one can|can%1:06:02:: love|love%1:18:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: a heart, and so I am|be%2:42:03:: resolved|resolve%2:31:02:: 
to ask|ask%2:32:01:: Oz to give|give%2:40:00:: me one. If he does, I will go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the Munchkin 
maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: and marry|marry%2:41:00:: her." 
 
Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the 
story|story%1:10:03:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and now|now%4:02:05:: they knew|know%2:31:01:: why he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 to 
get|get%2:30:01:: a new|new%3:00:00:: heart. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "I shall ask|ask%2:32:01:: for brains|brain%1:08:00:: instead|instead%4:02:00:: 
of a heart; for a fool|fool%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what to do|do%2:41:01:: with a heart|heart%1:09:00:: if he 
had|have%2:40:00:: one." 
 
"I shall take|take%2:35:00:: the heart," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "for brains|brain%1:08:00:: do|do%2:36:01:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: make|make%2:30:00:: one happy, and happiness|happiness%1:12:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: in the world." 
 
Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: anything, for she was|be%2:42:03:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: to know|know%2:31:01:: which of 
her two friends|friend%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: right, and she decided|decide%2:31:00:: if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: 
to Kansas|kansa%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:02:: it did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: matter|matter%2:42:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: whether the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: no brains|brain%1:09:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: no heart, or each got|get%2:40:00:: what he wanted. 
 
 
 
What worried|worry%2:37:01:: her most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: that the bread|bread%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: gone, and another 
meal|meal%1:13:00:: for herself and Toto would empty|empty%2:30:01:: the basket. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 neither 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: nor the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: anything, but she was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: 
of tin|tin%1:27:00:: nor straw, and could not|not%4:02:00:: live|live%2:42:04:: unless she was|be%2:42:03:: fed. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VI. 
 
 
All this time|time%1:28:05:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 woods. The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: paved|pave%2:35:00:: with yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, but these 
were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: by dried|dry%2:30:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: and dead|dead%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: from the trees, 
and the walking|walking%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all good. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: few|few%3:00:00:: birds|bird%1:05:00:: in this part|part%1:24:00:: of the forest, for birds|bird%1:05:00:: love|love%2:37:02:: the 
open|open%3:00:00:unobstructed:00 country|country%1:15:02:: where there is|be%2:42:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of sunshine; but now|now%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:01:: 
there came|come%2:38:00:: a deep|deep%3:00:00:low:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: from some wild|wild%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: hidden|hide%2:39:00:: among the trees. 
These sounds|sound%1:11:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl's heart beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast, for she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know|know%2:31:01:: what made|make%2:36:00:: them; but Toto knew, and he walked|walk%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to Dorothy's 
side, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: even|even%2:30:01:: bark|bark%1:11:00:: in return. 
 
"How long|long%4:02:00:: will it be," the child|child%1:18:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "before we 
are|be%2:42:03:: out of the forest?" 
 
"I cannot tell," was|be%2:42:06:: the answer, "for I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the 
Emerald City. But my father|father%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: there once, when I was|be%2:42:03:: a boy, and 
he said|say%2:32:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: through a dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: country, although 
nearer to the city|city%1:15:00:: where Oz dwells|dwell%2:42:00:: the country|country%1:15:02:: is|be%2:42:03:: beautiful. But I|i%1:27:00:: 
am not|not%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I have|have%2:40:00:: my oil-can, and nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: can hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the 
Scarecrow, while you bear|bear%2:42:01:: upon your forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the good|good%3:00:02:: 
Witch's kiss, and that will protect|protect%2:33:00:: you from harm." 
 
"But Toto!" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously; "what will protect|protect%2:33:00:: him?" 
 
"We must protect|protect%2:33:00:: him ourselves, if he is|be%2:42:03:: in danger," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman. 
 
Just|just%4:02:05:: as he spoke|speak%2:32:00:: there came|come%2:38:00:: from the forest|forest%1:14:00:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 roar, and the 
next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: bounded|bound%2:38:01:: into the road. With one blow|blow%1:04:01:: of his 
paw|paw%2:35:01:: he sent|send%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: spinning|spin%2:38:01:: over and over to the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the 
road, and then|then%4:02:00:: he struck|strike%2:35:00:: at the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: with his sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: claws. 
But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make|make%2:36:00:: no impression|impression%1:09:00:: on the tin, 
although the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: over|over%4:02:01:: in the road|road%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: still. 
 
Little|little%3:00:01:: Toto, now|now%4:02:05:: that he had|have%2:40:00:: an enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: to face, ran|run%2:38:00:: barking|bark%2:32:01:: toward the 
Lion, and the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: his mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: the dog, when 
Dorothy, fearing|fear%2:37:03:: Toto would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, and heedless of danger, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward|forward%4:02:00:: and slapped|slap%2:35:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: upon his nose|nose%1:08:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as she could, 
while she cried|cry%2:32:01:: out: 
 
"Don't you dare|dare%2:41:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: Toto! You ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself, a 
big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: like you, to bite|bite%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: dog!" 
 
"I didn't bite|bite%1:26:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, as he rubbed|rub%2:35:00:: his nose|nose%1:08:00:: with his 
paw|paw%1:08:01:: where Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: hit|hit%2:35:00:: it. 
 
"No, but you tried|try%2:41:00:: to," she retorted. "You are|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a big|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
coward." 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, hanging|hang%2:38:03:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in shame; "I've always|always%4:02:00:: 
known|know%2:31:01:: it. But how can I help|help%2:41:00:: it?" 
 
"I don't know, I'm sure. To think|think%2:31:00:: of your striking|strike%2:35:00:: a stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: man, 
like the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow!" 
 
"Is he stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, in surprise, as he watched|watch%2:41:00:: her pick|pick%1:14:00:: 
up the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:35:00:: him upon his feet, while she patted|pat%2:35:01:: him into 
shape|shape%1:08:00:: again. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: he's stuffed," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: angry. 
 
"That's why he went|go%2:38:00:: over so|so%4:02:02:: easily," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. "It astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
me to see|see%2:39:00:: him whirl|whirl%1:04:02:: around so. Is|be%2:42:03:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one stuffed, also?" 
 
"No," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "he's made|make%2:42:05:: of tin." And she helped|help%2:41:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
again. 
 
"That's why he nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: blunted|blunt%2:30:01:: my claws," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "When they 
scratched|scratch%2:35:03:: against the tin|tin%1:06:01:: it made|make%2:32:00:: a cold|cold%1:09:00:: shiver|shiver%2:38:00:: run|run%2:38:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: my back. 
What is|be%2:42:06:: that little|little%3:00:01:: animal|animal%1:03:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: tender|tender%3:00:00:loving:00 of?" 
 
"He is|be%2:42:06:: my dog, Toto," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Is he made|make%2:42:05:: of tin, or stuffed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Neither. He's a--a--a meat|meat%1:13:01:: dog," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh. He's a curious|curious%3:00:00:: animal, and seems|seem%2:39:00:: remarkably|remarkably%4:02:00:: small, now|now%4:02:05:: that I 
look|look%2:39:00:: at him. No|no%1:10:00:: one would think|think%2:31:00:: of biting|bite%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a little|little%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: except 
a coward|coward%1:18:00:: like me," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the Lion, sadly. 
 
"What makes|make%2:30:00:: you a coward?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, looking|look%2:39:00:: at the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: 
in wonder, for he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as a small|small%3:00:00:: horse. 
 
 
 
"It's a mystery," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: that 
way. All the other|other%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to be|be%2:42:03:: 
brave, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts. 
I learned|learn%2:31:00:: that if I roared|roar%2:32:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: loudly|loudly%4:02:00:: every living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: and got|get%2:30:00:: out of my way. Whenever I've met|meet%2:38:01:: a man|man%1:18:00:: I've been|be%2:42:03:: 
awfully|awfully%4:02:00:: scared; but I just|just%4:02:03:: roared|roar%2:32:03:: at him, and he has|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could go. If the elephants|elephant%1:05:00:: and the tigers|tiger%1:05:00:: and the bears|bear%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: tried|try%2:41:00:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: me, I should have|have%2:40:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: myself--I'm such a 
coward; but just|just%4:02:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they hear|hear%2:39:00:: me roar|roar%1:10:00:: they all try|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:35:09:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: from me, and of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them go." 
 
"But that isn't right. The King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts|beast%1:03:00:: shouldn't be|be%2:42:03:: a coward," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:01:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: a tear|tear%2:29:00:: from his eye|eye%1:08:00:: with the 
tip|tip%1:25:00:: of his tail; "it is|be%2:42:06:: my great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow, and makes|make%2:30:00:: my life|life%1:26:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
unhappy. But whenever there is|be%2:42:04:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: my heart|heart%1:08:00:: begins|begin%2:30:00:: to beat|beat%2:38:00:: fast." 
 
"Perhaps you have|have%2:29:02:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"It may be," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"If you have," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: glad, for 
it proves|prove%2:31:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. For my part, I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart; so I cannot 
have|have%2:40:00:: heart|heart%1:08:00:: disease." 
 
"Perhaps," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully, "if I had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should 
not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Have you brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so. I've never|never%4:02:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: to see," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I am going|go%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, "for my head|head%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw." 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"And I am|be%2:42:06:: going|go%2:41:00:: to ask|ask%2:32:01:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: Toto and me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," added|add%2:32:01:: 
Dorothy. 
 
"Do you think|think%2:31:03:: Oz could give|give%2:40:03:: me courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion. 
 
"Just as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as he could give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Or give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Or send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go|go%2:38:00:: with you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for my 
life|life%1:26:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: simply|simply%4:02:03:: unbearable|unbearable%3:00:00:: without a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of courage." 
 
"You will be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: welcome," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "for you will help|help%2:41:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts. It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me they must be|be%2:42:06:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: than you are|be%2:42:03:: if they allow|allow%2:32:00:: you to scare|scare%2:37:00:: them so easily." 
 
"They really|really%4:02:03:: are," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "but that doesn't make|make%2:30:00:: me any braver, 
and as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I know|know%2:31:02:: myself to be|be%2:42:03:: a coward|coward%1:18:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: unhappy." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: company|company%1:14:01:: set|set%2:30:01:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the journey, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: with stately|stately%3:00:00:impressive:00 strides|stride%1:04:00:: at Dorothy's side. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: approve|approve%2:32:00:: 
this new|new%3:00:00:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: at first, for he could not|not%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: how nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: he 
had|have%2:30:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: crushed|crush%2:35:00:: between the Lion's great|great%3:00:01:large:00 jaws; but after a time|time%1:28:00:: he 
became|become%2:30:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: at ease, and presently|presently%4:02:00:: Toto and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
grown|grow%2:30:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: friends. 
 
During the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of that day|day%1:28:00:: there was|be%2:42:04:: no other|other%3:00:00:: adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: to mar the 
peace|peace%1:26:02:: of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon a 
beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: that was|be%2:42:03:: crawling|crawl%2:38:00:: along the road, and killed|kill%2:35:00:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 little|little%3:00:01:: 
thing. This made|make%2:30:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy, for he was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: 
careful|careful%3:00:00:mindful:00 not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: any living|live%2:42:04:: creature; and as he walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he 
wept|weep%2:29:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 tears|tear%1:08:01:: of sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: and regret. These tears|tear%1:08:01:: ran|run%2:38:01:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
his face|face%1:08:00:: and over the hinges|hinge%1:06:00:: of his jaw, and there they rusted. 
When Dorothy presently|presently%4:02:00:: asked|ask%2:32:00:: him a question|question%1:10:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could 
not|not%4:02:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: his mouth, for his jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: together. He 
became|become%2:30:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at this and made|make%2:41:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: motions|motion%1:04:00:: to Dorothy to 
relieve|relieve%2:40:01:: him, but she could not|not%4:02:00:: understand. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: puzzled|puzzle%2:31:00:: 
to know|know%2:31:01:: what was|be%2:42:03:: wrong. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the oil-can from 
Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few|few%3:00:00:: 
moments|moment%1:28:01:: he could talk|talk%2:32:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as before. 
 
 
 
"This will serve|serve%2:42:03:: me a lesson," said|say%2:32:00:: he, "to look|look%2:39:00:: where I step. For if 
I should kill|kill%2:35:00:: another bug|bug%1:05:02:: or beetle|beetle%1:05:00:: I should surely|surely%4:02:00:: cry|cry%2:29:00:: again, and 
crying|cry%2:34:00:: rusts|rust%2:30:01:: my jaw|jaw%1:08:00:: so that I cannot speak." 
 
Thereafter|thereafter%4:02:00:: he walked|walk%2:38:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: carefully, with his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on the road, 
and when he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 ant|ant%1:05:00:: toiling by he would step|step%2:38:01:: over it, so|so%4:02:05:: as 
not|not%4:02:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: it. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and 
therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: he took|take%2:41:04:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 care|care%1:09:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: cruel|cruel%3:00:01:inhumane:00 or unkind|unkind%3:00:00:: to anything. 
 
"You people|people%1:14:00:: with hearts," he said, "have something to guide|guide%2:38:00:: you, 
and need never|never%4:02:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: wrong; but I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and so I must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
careful. When Oz gives|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: of course|course%1:14:00:: I needn't mind|mind%1:09:00:: so much."

They were|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to camp|camp%1:06:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: that night|night%1:28:00:: under a large|large%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the 
forest, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no houses|house%1:06:00:: near. The tree|tree%1:20:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a good, thick|thick%3:00:01:: 
covering|cover%2:35:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: them from the dew, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood|wood%1:27:00:: with his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and Dorothy built|build%2:36:00:: a splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 fire|fire%1:06:00:: that 
warmed|warm%2:30:01:: her and made|make%2:30:00:: her feel|feel%2:37:00:: less|less%4:02:00:: lonely. She and Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: the last|last%3:00:00:: of 
their bread, and now|now%4:02:05:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what they would do|do%2:41:01:: for breakfast. 
 
"If you wish," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I will go|go%2:38:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and kill|kill%2:35:00:: a 
deer|deer%1:05:00:: for you. You can roast|roast%1:13:00:: it by the fire, since your tastes|taste%1:12:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
peculiar|peculiar%3:00:00:unusual:00 that you prefer|prefer%2:37:00:: cooked|cook%2:36:01:: food, and then|then%4:02:00:: you will have|have%2:34:00:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: breakfast." 
 
"Don't! please|please%2:37:01:: don't," begged|beg%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "I should certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: 
weep if you killed|kill%2:35:00:: a poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 deer, and then|then%4:02:00:: my jaws|jaw%1:08:00:: would rust|rust%1:22:00:: again." 
 
 
 
But the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: into the forest|forest%1:14:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 supper, and no 
one|one%1:23:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: knew|know%2:31:01:: what it was, for he didn't mention|mention%1:10:01:: it. And the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
found|find%2:40:02:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's basket|basket%1:06:00:: with them, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that she would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: hungry|hungry%3:00:00:: for a long|long%3:00:02:: time. She thought|think%2:31:03:: this was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
kind|kind%1:09:00:: and thoughtful|thoughtful%3:00:00:considerate:00 of the Scarecrow, but she laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: heartily|heartily%4:02:03:: at the 
awkward|awkward%3:00:00:unwieldy:00 way|way%1:07:01:: in which the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 creature|creature%1:03:00:: picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the nuts. His padded|padded%3:00:00:soft:01 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 and the nuts|nut%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that he dropped|drop%2:38:00:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: 
as|as%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: as he put|put%2:35:00:: in the basket. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: how 
long|long%4:02:00:: it took|take%2:40:06:: him to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the basket, for it enabled|enable%2:30:00:: him to keep|keep%2:41:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
from the fire, as he feared|fear%2:37:03:: a spark|spark%2:43:00:: might get|get%2:38:12:: into his straw|straw%1:27:01:: and burn|burn%2:30:02:: 
him up. So he kept|keep%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: from the flames, and only|only%4:02:02:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
near to cover|cover%2:35:00:: Dorothy with dry|dry%3:00:01:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: when she lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to sleep. These 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: her very|very%4:02:00:: snug|snug%3:00:00:comfortable:00 and warm|warm%3:00:01:: and she slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until morning. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: daylight|daylight%1:19:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: bathed|bath%2:29:00:: her face|face%1:08:00:: in a little|little%3:00:01:: rippling|ripple%2:38:00:: 
brook|brook%1:17:00:: and soon|soon%4:02:00:: after they all started|start%2:38:02:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
This was|be%2:42:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: an eventful|eventful%3:00:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: for the travellers. They had|have%2:40:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: an hour|hour%1:28:00:: when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: before them a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: that 
crossed|cross%2:38:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: and divided|divide%2:41:00:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see|see%2:39:00:: on 
either side. It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: ditch, and when they crept|creep%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the 
edge|edge%1:15:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: into it they could see|see%2:39:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: deep, and 
there were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: big, jagged|jagged%3:00:00:uneven:00 rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. The sides|side%1:15:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:07:: 
steep|steep%1:17:00:: that none|none%1:28:00:: of them could climb|climb%2:38:00:: down, and for a moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
that their journey|journey%1:04:00:: must end. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, despairingly. 
 
"I haven't the faintest|faint%3:00:02:indistinct:00 idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
shook|shake%2:38:00:: his shaggy mane|mane%1:05:00:: and looked|look%2:29:00:: thoughtful. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said: 
 
"We cannot fly, that is|be%2:42:03:: certain; neither can we climb|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: into this 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump|jump%1:11:00:: over it, we must stop|stop%2:38:00:: where 
we are." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:03:: I could jump|jump%2:38:00:: over it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, after 
measuring|measure%2:30:00:: the distance|distance%1:07:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: in his mind. 
 
"Then we are|be%2:42:03:: all right," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for you can carry|carry%2:38:07:: 
us all over|over%4:02:05:: on your back, one at a time." 
 
"Well, I'll try|try%1:04:00:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "Who will go|go%2:41:00:: first?" 
 
"I will," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "for, if you found|find%2:31:09:: that you could 
not|not%4:02:00:: jump|jump%2:38:00:: over the gulf, Dorothy would be|be%2:42:03:: killed, or the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
badly|badly%4:02:00:: dented|dent%2:35:00:: on the rocks|rock%1:17:01:: below. But if I am|be%2:42:05:: on your back|back%1:08:00:: it will not|not%4:02:00:: 
matter so|so%4:02:02:: much, for the fall|fall%1:04:01:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me at all." 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of falling, myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, 
"but I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but try|try%2:41:01:: it. So|so%4:02:05:: get|get%2:30:00:: on my back|back%1:08:00:: 
and we will make|make%2:41:00:: the attempt." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:38:00:: upon the Lion's back, and the big|big%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to 
the edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: and crouched|crouch%2:38:00:: down. 
 
"Why don't you run|run%2:38:00:: and jump?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Because that isn't the way|way%1:07:01:: we Lions|lion%1:05:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: these things," he replied. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: giving|give%2:40:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spring, he shot|shoot%2:38:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: and landed|land%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: 
on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. They were|be%2:42:03:: all greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: how easily|easily%4:02:01:: he 
did|do%2:36:01:: it, and after the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:41:00:: got|get%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from his back|back%1:08:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
sprang|spring%2:38:01:: across the ditch|ditch%1:06:00:: again. 
 
Dorothy thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:38:00:: next; so she took|take%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
climbed|climb%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back, holding|hold%2:35:00:: tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: to his mane|mane%1:05:00:: with one 
hand. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: as if she was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: through the air; 
and then, before she had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about it, she was|be%2:42:03:: safe|safe%3:00:01:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: a third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: and got|get%2:40:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
and then|then%4:02:00:: they all sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: for a few|few%3:00:00:: moments|moment%1:28:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: the beast|beast%1:03:00:: a 
chance|chance%1:26:00:: to rest, for his great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 leaps|leap%1:04:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: his breath|breath%1:27:00:: short, and he 
panted|pant%2:32:00:: like a big|big%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: that has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: running|run%2:38:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long. 
 
 
 
They found|find%2:31:10:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 on this side, and it looked|look%2:39:01:: dark|dark%1:28:00:: 
and gloomy. After the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: rested|rest%2:32:00:: they started|start%2:38:02:: along the road|road%1:06:00:: 
of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, silently wondering, each in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 mind, if ever|ever%4:02:04:: 
they would come|come%2:38:04:: to the end|end%1:15:00:: of the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and reach|reach%2:38:01:: the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: 
again. To add|add%2:30:00:: to their discomfort, they soon|soon%4:02:00:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: noises|noise%1:11:00:: in 
the depths|depth%1:07:00:: of the forest, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: whispered|whisper%2:32:00:: to them that it was|be%2:42:06:: 
in this part|part%1:15:00:: of the country|country%1:15:00:: that the Kalidahs lived. 
 
"What are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:03:: monstrous|monstrous%3:00:00:evil:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:00:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like 
tigers," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion; "and with claws|claw%1:05:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%3:00:01:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: that 
they could tear|tear%2:35:00:: me in two as|as%4:02:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: as I could kill|kill%2:35:00:: Toto. I'm 
terribly|terribly%4:02:01:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of the Kalidahs." 
 
"I'm not|not%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: that you are," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy "They must be|be%2:42:03:: 
dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 beasts." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to another gulf|gulf%1:17:01:: 
across the road; but this one|one%1:23:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: broad|broad%3:00:04:: and deep|deep%3:00:00:thick:01 that the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
knew|know%2:31:01:: at once|once%4:02:00:: he could not|not%4:02:00:: leap|leap%2:38:00:: across it. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: what they should do, and after serious|serious%3:00:00:critical:03 
thought|think%2:31:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 tree, standing|stand%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the ditch. If the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: can chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, so that it will fall|fall%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side, we 
can walk|walk%2:38:00:: across it easily." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: a first|first%3:00:00:best:00 rate|rate%1:24:00:: idea," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "One would almost|almost%4:02:00:: suspect|suspect%2:32:00:: 
you had|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in your head, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of straw." 
 
The Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:02:: at once, and so|so%4:02:02:: sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: that the 
tree|tree%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: through. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: put|put%2:35:05:: his strong|strong%3:00:00:: 
front|front%3:00:00:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: against the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and pushed|push%2:38:00:: with all his might, and slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
the big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: tipped|tip%2:38:01:: and fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:04:00:: across the ditch, with its 
top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: on the other|other%3:00:00:: side. 
 
They had|have%2:40:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: started|start%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: this queer|queer%1:18:00:: bridge|bridge%1:06:00:: when a sharp|sharp%3:00:00:high:03 growl|growl%1:11:00:: 
made|make%2:32:00:: them all look|look%2:39:00:: up, and to their horror|horror%1:12:01:: they saw|saw%2:35:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: toward 
them two great|great%3:00:01:large:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: with bodies|body%1:08:01:: like bears|bear%1:05:00:: and heads|head%1:08:00:: like tigers. 
 
"They are|be%2:42:06:: the Kalidahs!" said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble. 
 
"Quick!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, "let us cross|cross%2:38:00:: over." 
 
 
 
So Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: first, holding|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms; the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
followed, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: next. The Lion, although he was|be%2:42:03:: 
certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: afraid, turned|turn%2:38:00:: to face|face%2:32:00:: the Kalidahs, and then|then%4:02:00:: he gave|give%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
loud|loud%3:00:00:: and terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 a roar|roar%1:11:00:: that Dorothy screamed|scream%2:32:01:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: 
over backwards, while even|even%4:02:00:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%3:00:02:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: 
at him in surprise. 
 
But, seeing|see%2:31:01:: they were|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the Lion, and remembering|remember%2:31:00:: that 
there were|be%2:42:04:: two of them and only|only%4:02:02:: one of him, the Kalidahs again|again%4:02:00:: rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
forward, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: over the tree|tree%1:20:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:31:01:: what 
they would do|do%2:41:01:: next. Without stopping|stop%2:42:00:: an instant|instant%1:28:01:: the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 beasts|beast%1:03:00:: 
also|also%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: the tree, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: lost, for they will surely|surely%4:02:00:: tear|tear%2:35:01:: us to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: with their sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
claws. But stand|stand%1:06:03:: close|close%1:28:00:: behind me, and I will fight|fight%2:33:01:: them as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as I 
am|be%2:42:03:: alive." 
 
"Wait a minute!" called|call%2:32:09:: the Scarecrow. He had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:06:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: what was|be%2:42:06:: 
best|best%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: done, and now|now%4:02:05:: he asked|ask%2:32:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: away|away%4:02:01:: the end|end%1:15:00:: 
of the tree|tree%1:20:00:: that rested|rest%2:35:00:: on their side|side%1:15:02:: of the ditch. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to use|use%2:34:01:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: at once, and, just|just%4:02:05:: as the two Kalidahs were|be%2:42:03:: 
nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: across, the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: into the gulf, carrying|carry%2:35:02:: the 
ugly, snarling brutes|brute%1:18:00:: with it, and both were|be%2:42:03:: dashed|dash%2:35:02:: to pieces|piece%1:06:00:: on the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: rocks|rock%1:17:01:: at the bottom. 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, drawing|draw%2:34:01:: a long|long%3:00:02:: breath|breath%1:04:00:: of relief, "I 
see|see%2:31:01:: we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to live|live%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: while longer, and I am|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: of it, 
for it must be|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: uncomfortable|uncomfortable%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: alive. Those 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: me so|so%4:02:02:: badly|badly%4:02:02:: that my heart|heart%1:08:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: beating|beat%2:38:00:: yet." 
 
"Ah." said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly, "I wish|wish%1:12:00:: I had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:08:00:: to beat." 
 
 
 
This adventure|adventure%1:04:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: out of 
the forest, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: that Dorothy became|become%2:30:00:: tired, and had|have%2:40:00:: 
to ride|ride%2:38:01:: on the Lion's back. To their great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy|joy%1:12:00:: the trees|tree%1:20:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: thinner|thin%3:00:01:insignificant:00 
the further|far%4:02:04:: they advanced, and in the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: they suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon 
a broad|broad%3:00:04:: river, flowing|flow%2:38:00:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: before them. On the other|other%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of 
the water|water%1:27:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: through a 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country, with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 meadows|meadow%1:15:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: with bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:02:: and 
all the road|road%1:06:00:: bordered|border%2:42:00:: with trees|tree%1:20:00:: hanging|hang%2:35:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of delicious|delicious%3:00:00:pleasing:00 fruits. They 
were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: this delightful|delightful%3:00:00:pleasing:00 country|country%1:15:02:: before them. 
 
"How shall we cross|cross%2:38:00:: the river?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: done," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: must 
build|build%2:36:00:: us a raft, so we can float|float%2:38:01:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: took|take%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop|chop%2:35:01:: down|down%4:02:00:: small|small%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
a raft, and while he was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: at this the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: on the river|river%1:17:00:: 
bank|bank%2:40:00:: a tree|tree%1:20:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fruit. This pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but nuts|nut%1:20:00:: all day, and she made|make%2:30:00:: a hearty|hearty%3:00:01:healthy:00 meal|meal%1:13:00:: of the ripe|ripe%3:00:00:: fruit. 
 
But it takes|take%2:42:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to make|make%2:36:01:: a raft, even|even%4:02:00:: when one is|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: industrious|industrious%3:00:00:diligent:00 and 
untiring as the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, and when night|night%1:28:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: the work|work%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: done. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they found|find%2:40:02:: a cozy|cozy%3:00:00:comfortable:00 place|place%1:15:00:: under the trees|tree%1:20:00:: where they slept|sleep%2:29:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: until 
the morning; and Dorothy dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: of the Emerald City, and of the good|good%3:00:01:: 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: Oz, who would soon|soon%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: her back|back%4:02:04:: to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: VIII. 
 
 
Our little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: of travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:01:: next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: refreshed|refresh%2:30:00:: and 
full|full%3:00:00:: of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted|breakfast%2:34:00:: like a princess|princess%1:18:00:: off peaches|peach%1:13:00:: and 
plums|plum%1:13:00:: from the trees|tree%1:20:00:: beside the river. 
 
Behind them was|be%2:42:03:: the dark|dark%3:00:01:: forest|forest%1:14:00:: they had|have%2:30:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: through, 
although they had|have%2:39:06:: suffered|suffer%2:39:01:: many|many%3:00:00:: discouragements; but before them was|be%2:42:05:: a 
lovely, sunny|sunny%3:00:00:cheerful:00 country|country%1:15:02:: that seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to beckon|beckon%2:32:00:: them on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, the broad|broad%3:00:04:: river|river%1:17:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: them off|off%4:02:00:: from this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: 
land; but the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: done, and after the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: cut|cut%2:35:00:: 
a few|few%3:00:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: logs|log%1:27:01:: and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: them together|together%4:02:02:: with wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pins, they 
were|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to start. Dorothy sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the raft|raft%1:06:00:: and 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: stepped|step%2:38:01:: upon the raft|raft%1:06:00:: 
it tipped|tip%2:38:01:: badly, for he was|be%2:42:03:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy; but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to steady|steady%3:00:00:secure:03 it, and they had|have%2:40:01:: long|long%4:02:00:: 
poles|pole%1:06:00:: in their hands|hand%1:08:00:: to push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: through the water. 
 
They got|get%2:30:00:: along|along%4:02:00:: quite|quite%4:02:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: at first, but when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the middle|middle%1:09:00:: 
of the river|river%1:17:00:: the swift|swift%3:00:00:fast:01 current|current%1:11:00:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: stream, farther|far%4:02:00:: 
and farther|far%4:02:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick; and the water|water%1:27:00:: grew|grow%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
deep|deep%4:02:00:: that the long|long%3:00:01:: poles|pole%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: the bottom. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: bad," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for if we cannot get|get%2:38:00:: to the 
land|land%2:38:03:: we shall be|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: into the country|country%1:15:02:: of the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the 
West, and she will enchant|enchant%2:37:00:: us and make|make%2:30:00:: us her slaves." 
 
"And then|then%4:02:02:: I should get|get%2:40:00:: no brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
 
 
"And I should get|get%2:40:00:: no heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I should never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"We must certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: if we can," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
continued, and he pushed|push%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: on his long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: that it stuck|stick%2:38:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: 
in the mud|mud%1:27:00:: at the bottom|bottom%1:17:00:: of the river, and before he could pull|pull%2:35:00:: it 
out again, or let|let%2:41:00:: go, the raft|raft%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: swept|sweep%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
left|left%4:02:03:: clinging|cling%2:35:00:: to the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the river. 
 
"Good bye!" he called|call%2:32:09:: after them, and they were|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to leave|leave%2:38:01:: 
him; indeed, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to cry, but fortunately|fortunately%4:02:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:01:: 
that he might rust, and so|so%4:02:05:: dried|dry%2:30:01:: his tears|tear%1:08:01:: on Dorothy's apron. 
 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: this was|be%2:42:06:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:26:00:: for the Scarecrow. 
 
"I am now|now%4:02:00:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: than when I first|first%4:02:02:: met|meet%2:38:01:: Dorothy," he thought. 
"Then, I was|be%2:42:03:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a cornfield, where I could make|make%2:36:00:: 
believe|believe%2:31:00:: scare|scare%2:37:00:: the crows, at any rate; but surely|surely%4:02:00:: there is|be%2:42:00:: no use|use%1:07:00:: for 
a Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuck|stick%2:35:02:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of a river. I am|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: any brains, after all!" 
 
 
 
Down the stream|stream%1:17:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: floated, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said: 
 
"Something must be|be%2:42:06:: done|do%2:36:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: us. I think|think%2:31:03:: I can swim|swim%2:38:00:: to the shore|shore%1:06:00:: 
and pull|pull%2:35:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: after me, if you will only|only%4:02:02:: hold|hold%2:42:00:: fast|fast%4:02:02:: to the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of 
my tail." 
 
 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: into the water|water%1:27:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: fast|fast%3:00:01:: hold|hold%1:06:00:: 
of his tail, when the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to swim|swim%2:38:00:: with all his might|might%1:07:00:: toward 
the shore. It was|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, although he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: big; but by and by 
they were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:03:: out of the current, and then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy took|take%2:40:15:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman's long|long%3:00:01:: pole|pole%1:06:00:: and helped|help%2:41:00:: push|push%2:38:00:: the raft|raft%1:06:00:: to the land. 
 
They were|be%2:42:03:: all tired|tire%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: when they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the shore|shore%1:17:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 and 
stepped|step%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: upon the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grass, and they also|also%4:02:00:: knew|know%2:31:02:: that the 
stream|stream%1:17:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them a long|long%3:00:01:: way|way%1:15:00:: past the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: that 
led|lead%2:42:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: 
on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to let|let%2:41:00:: the sun|sun%1:19:00:: dry|dry%3:00:01:: him. 
 
"We must get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road, in some way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The best|best%3:00:00:: plan|plan%1:09:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: along the river|river%1:17:00:: bank|bank%1:17:01:: until we come|come%2:38:04:: to 
the road|road%1:06:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So, when they were|be%2:42:03:: rested, Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: and they 
started|start%2:38:02:: along the grassy|grassy%3:00:00:: bank, back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: from which the river|river%1:17:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: them. It was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 country, with plenty|plenty%1:23:00:: of flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
and fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: and sunshine|sunshine%1:19:00:: to cheer|cheer%2:37:02:: them, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:29:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
sorry for the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they could have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 happy. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could, Dorothy only|only%4:02:02:: stopping|stop%2:38:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: to 
pick|pick%2:31:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: flower; and after a time|time%1:28:05:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:07:: out, 
 
"Look!" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they all looked|look%2:39:00:: at the river|river%1:17:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon 
his pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the water, looking|look%2:39:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: lonely|lonely%3:00:00:uninhabited:00 and sad. 
 
"What can we do|do%2:41:01:: to save|save%2:41:01:: him?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: both shook|shake%2:38:00:: their heads, for they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
know. So they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the bank|bank%1:17:01:: and gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: wistfully|wistfully%4:02:00:: at the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: until a Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: by, which, seeing|see%2:39:00:: them, stopped|stop%2:38:00:: to rest|rest%2:32:00:: 
at the water's edge. 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and where are|be%2:42:03:: you going?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl; "and these are|be%2:42:06:: my friends, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion; and we are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"This isn't the road," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, as she twisted|twist%2:38:01:: her long|long%3:00:01:: neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: sharply|sharply%4:02:00:: at the queer party. 
 
"I know|know%2:31:02:: it," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, "but we have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: the Scarecrow, and 
are|be%2:42:03:: wondering|wonder%2:32:01:: how we shall get|get%2:35:03:: him again." 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: he?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Stork. 
 
"Over there|there%4:02:00:: in the river," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"If he wasn't so|so%4:02:02:: big|big%3:00:01:: and heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: I would get|get%2:35:03:: him for you," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Stork. 
 
"He isn't heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: a bit," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, eagerly, "for he is|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: 
with straw; and if you will bring|bring%2:38:00:: him back|back%4:02:04:: to us we shall thank|thank%2:32:00:: you 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: and ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much." 
 
"Well, I'll try," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork; "but if I find|find%2:31:10:: he is|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to 
carry|carry%2:30:05:: I shall have|have%2:39:06:: to drop|drop%2:38:01:: him in the river|river%1:17:00:: again." 
 
So the big|big%3:00:01:: bird|bird%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and over the water|water%1:17:00:: till she came|come%2:38:04:: to 
where the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: perched|perch%2:35:00:: upon his pole. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: with 
her great|great%3:00:01:large:00 claws|claw%1:05:02:: grabbed|grab%2:35:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: by the arm|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: 
into the air|air%1:15:00:: and back|back%4:02:04:: to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and Toto were|be%2:42:03:: sitting. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: found|find%2:39:01:: himself among his friends|friend%1:18:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
happy|happy%3:00:00:: that he hugged|hug%2:35:01:: them all, even|even%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto; and as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along he sang|sing%2:36:00:: "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt|feel%2:31:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: gay. 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: I should have|have%2:39:06:: to stay|stay%2:42:02:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: forever," he said, 
"but the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: me, and if I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: any brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
find|find%2:39:01:: the Stork|stork%1:05:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and do|do%2:36:02:: it some kindness|kindness%1:04:00:: in return." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Stork, who was|be%2:42:03:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: beside them. 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: anyone in trouble. But I must go|go%2:38:01:: now, for 
my babies|baby%1:18:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: in the nest|nest%1:17:00:: for me. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: the 
Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: and that Oz will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: the kind|kind%1:09:00:: Stork|stork%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the 
air|air%1:27:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: along listening|listen%2:39:00:: to the singing|singing%1:04:00:: of the bright-colored 
birds|bird%1:05:00:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: which now|now%4:02:05:: became|become%2:30:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 that 
the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: carpeted|carpet%2:35:01:: with them. There were|be%2:42:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and white|white%3:00:01:: and 
blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 blossoms, besides great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clusters|cluster%1:14:00:: of scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, 
which were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: brilliant|brilliant%3:00:00:colorful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: they almost|almost%4:02:00:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: Dorothy's eyes. 
 
"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl|girl%1:18:00:: asked, as she breathed|breathe%2:29:00:: in the spicy 
scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: so," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "When I have|have%2:40:00:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: I shall 
probably|probably%4:02:00:: like them better." 
 
"If I only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: I should love|love%2:37:00:: them," added|add%2:32:01:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I always|always%4:02:00:: did|do%2:42:00:: like flowers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion; "they seem|seem%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: helpless|helpless%3:00:00:dependent:00 
and frail. But there are|be%2:42:04:: none|none%1:28:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as these." 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:04:: upon more|more%3:00:02:: and more|more%3:00:02:: of the big|big%3:00:01:: scarlet|scarlet%3:00:00:chromatic:00 poppies, and 
fewer|few%3:00:00:: and fewer|few%3:00:00:: of the other|other%3:00:00:: flowers; and soon|soon%4:02:00:: they found|find%2:39:01:: themselves 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 meadow|meadow%1:15:00:: of poppies. Now|now%1:28:00:: it is|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:00:: 
that when there are|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these flowers|flower%1:20:02:: together|together%4:02:03:: their odor|odor%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: that anyone who breathes|breathe%2:29:00:: it falls|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, and if the sleeper|sleeper%1:18:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: away|away%4:02:00:: from the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: he sleeps|sleep%2:29:00:: on and on 
forever. But Dorothy did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, nor could she get|get%2:30:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: from 
the bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that were|be%2:42:04:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: about; so|so%4:02:05:: presently|presently%4:02:00:: her 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: grew|grow%2:30:03:: heavy|heavy%3:00:03:: and she felt|feel%2:31:00:: she must sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to rest|rest%1:04:00:: and to sleep. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. 
 
"We must hurry|hurry%2:38:00:: and get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: before dark," 
he said; and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: with him. So they kept|keep%2:42:07:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: 
until Dorothy could stand|stand%2:35:00:: no longer. Her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: closed|close%2:35:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of 
herself and she forgot|forget%2:31:01:: where she was|be%2:42:05:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: among the poppies, fast|fast%4:02:01:: 
asleep. 
 
"What shall we do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"If we leave|leave%2:31:05:: her here|here%4:02:00:: she will die," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "The smell|smell%1:07:00:: of the 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: killing|kill%2:30:04:: us all. I myself can scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:42:00:: my eyes|eye%1:08:00:: open|open%2:35:00:: 
and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: already." 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: true; Toto had|have%2:42:00:: fallen|fall%2:30:08:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh, were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
troubled|trouble%2:37:01:: by the scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
 
 
"Run fast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Lion, "and get|get%2:30:00:: out of this 
deadly|deadly%3:00:00:unpardonable:00 flower-bed as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as you can. We will bring|bring%2:38:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
with us, but if you should fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: carried." 
 
So the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: aroused|arouse%2:37:01:: himself and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as he could 
go. In a moment|moment%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: out of sight. 
 
"Let us make|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with our hands, and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. So they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: Toto and put|put%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in Dorothy's lap, and 
then|then%4:02:00:: they made|make%2:36:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: with their hands|hand%1:08:00:: for the seat|seat%1:06:01:: and their arms|arm%1:08:00:: for 
the arms|arm%1:08:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:02:: between them through the flowers. 
 
On and on they walked, and it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: of deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: them would never|never%4:02:00:: end. They followed|follow%2:38:01:: the bend|bend%1:06:00:: 
of the river, and at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 came|come%2:38:04:: upon their friend|friend%1:18:00:: the Lion, lying|lie%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:01:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: among the poppies. The flowers|flower%1:20:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:intense:00 for 
the huge|huge%3:00:01:large:00 beast|beast%1:03:00:: and he had|have%2:42:00:: given|give%2:38:13:: up, at last, and fallen|fall%2:38:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: a short|short%3:00:02:: 
distance|distance%1:07:00:: from the end|end%1:15:00:: of the poppy-bed, where the sweet|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 grass|grass%1:20:00:: spread|spread%1:04:00:: 
in beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: before them. 
 
"We can do|do%2:36:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: for him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, sadly; "for he is|be%2:42:03:: 
much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: to lift. We must leave|leave%2:31:05:: him here|here%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: on forever, 
and perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: he will dream|dream%2:39:00:: that he has|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: at last." 
 
"I'm sorry," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: comrade|comrade%1:18:00:: 
for one so|so%4:02:02:: cowardly. But let|let%2:41:00:: us go|go%2:30:01:: on." 
 
They carried|carry%2:35:02:: the sleeping|sleep%2:29:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: to a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 spot|spot%1:15:01:: beside the river, 
far|far%4:02:02:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: from the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: field|field%1:15:00:: to prevent|prevent%2:41:01:: her breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: any more|more%3:00:02:: of 
the poison|poison%1:27:00:: of the flowers, and here|here%4:02:00:: they laid|lay%2:35:00:: her gently|gently%4:02:00:: on the soft|soft%3:00:01:: 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and waited|wait%2:42:00:: for the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: breeze|breeze%1:19:00:: to waken|waken%2:29:00:: her. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: IX. 
 
 
"We cannot be|be%2:42:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: from the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, now," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow, as he stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside the girl, "for we have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as 
far|far%4:02:02:: as the river|river%1:17:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: us away." 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: about to reply|reply%2:32:00:: when he heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:03:: growl, and 
turning|turn%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: (which worked|work%2:35:02:: beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: on hinges) he saw|saw%2:35:00:: a 
strange|strange%3:00:00:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: bounding|bound%2:38:01:: over the grass|grass%1:20:00:: towards them. It was, 
indeed, a great, yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 wildcat, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it must be|be%2:42:06:: 
chasing|chase%2:38:00:: something, for its ears|ear%1:08:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: to its head|head%1:08:00:: and its 
mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: open, showing|show%2:39:00:: two rows|row%1:14:00:: of ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: teeth, while its red|red%1:07:00:: 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: glowed|glow%2:39:00:: like balls|ball%1:25:00:: of fire. As it came|come%2:38:04:: nearer the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: 
saw|saw%2:35:00:: that running|run%2:38:00:: before the beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: a little|little%3:00:01:: gray|gray%3:00:00:achromatic:00 field-mouse, and 
although he had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: he knew|know%2:31:02:: it was|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: for the wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: to try|try%2:41:00:: 
to kill|kill%2:35:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a pretty, harmless|harmless%3:00:00:: creature. 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, and as the wildcat|wildcat%1:06:00:: ran|run%2:38:00:: by he gave|give%2:40:03:: it a 
quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 blow|blow%1:04:01:: that cut|cut%2:35:00:: the beast's head|head%2:38:01:: clean|clean%3:00:00:perfect:00 off|off%4:02:03:: from its body, and it 
rolled|roll%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: at his feet|foot%1:08:01:: in two pieces. 
 
The field-mouse, now|now%4:02:05:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: freed|free%2:41:00:: from its enemy, stopped|stop%2:38:01:: short; 
and coming|come%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: up to the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: it said, in a squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you! Thank|thank%2:32:00:: you ever|ever%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: for saving|save%2:41:00:: my life." 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:01:: of it, I beg|beg%2:32:01:: of you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
heart, you know, so I am|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: to help|help%2:29:00:: all those who may need|need%2:34:01:: a 
friend, even|even%4:02:00:: if it happens|happen%2:30:02:: to be|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a mouse." 
 
"Only a mouse!" cried|cry%2:32:07:: the little|little%3:00:01:: animal, indignantly; "why, I am|be%2:42:03:: a 
Queen--the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: of all the field-mice!" 
 
"Oh, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, making|make%2:41:00:: a bow. 
 
"Therefore you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deed, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:07:: as a brave|brave%2:42:00:: one, in 
saving|save%2:41:05:: my life," added|add%2:32:01:: the Queen. 
 
At that moment|moment%1:28:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: seen|see%2:39:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as their 
little|little%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: could carry|carry%2:35:02:: them, and when they saw|saw%2:35:00:: their Queen|queen%1:18:01:: they 
exclaimed, 
 
[Illustration: "_Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the 
Queen._"] 
 
"Oh, your Majesty, we thought|think%2:31:03:: you would be|be%2:42:03:: killed! How did|do%2:41:01:: you manage|manage%2:41:09:: 
to escape|escape%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wildcat?" and they all bowed|bow%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: low|low%3:00:01:: to the 
little|little%3:00:01:: Queen|queen%1:18:01:: that they almost|almost%4:02:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon their heads. 
 
"This funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 tin|tin%1:27:00:: man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat|wildcat%1:05:00:: and saved|save%2:41:01:: my 
life. So|so%4:02:05:: hereafter|hereafter%4:02:00:: you must all serve|serve%2:41:01:: him, and obey|obey%2:41:00:: his slightest|slight%3:00:00:: wish." 
 
"We will!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: all the mice, in a shrill|shrill%3:00:00:high:03 chorus. And then|then%4:02:00:: they 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: in all directions, for Toto had|have%2:40:00:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: from his sleep, 
and seeing|see%2:39:00:: all these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: around him he gave|give%2:41:00:: one bark|bark%1:11:00:: of delight|delight%1:12:00:: and 
jumped|jump%2:38:00:: right|right%4:02:04:: into the middle|middle%1:09:00:: of the group. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: to 
chase mice|mouse%1:05:00:: when he lived|live%2:42:08:: in Kansas, and he saw|saw%2:35:00:: no harm|harm%1:11:01:: in it. 
 
But the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in his arms|arm%1:08:00:: and held|hold%2:35:00:: him tight, 
while he called|call%2:32:09:: to the mice: "Come back! come|come%2:38:00:: back! Toto shall not|not%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: you." 
 
At this the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: stuck|stick%2:38:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: out from a clump|clump%1:14:00:: of 
grass|grass%1:20:00:: and asked, in a timid|timid%3:00:00:cowardly:00 voice, 
 
"Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: he will not|not%4:02:00:: bite|bite%2:35:00:: us?" 
 
"I will not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
 
 
One by one the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: creeping|creep%2:38:00:: back, and Toto did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: bark|bark%2:32:00:: again, 
although he tried|try%2:41:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the Woodman's arms, and would have|have%2:40:00:: 
bitten|bite%2:35:00:: him had|have%2:40:00:: he not|not%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:01:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Finally|finally%4:02:03:: one 
of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: mice|mouse%1:05:00:: spoke. 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: anything we can do," it asked, "to repay|repay%2:40:00:: you for saving|save%2:41:01:: the 
life|life%1:18:00:: of our Queen?" 
 
"Nothing that I know|know%2:31:01:: of," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, 
who had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to think, but could not|not%4:02:00:: because his head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw, said, quickly, 
 
"Oh, yes; you can save|save%2:41:01:: our friend, the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, who is|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: 
in the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed." 
 
"A Lion!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: Queen; "why, he would eat|eat%2:34:00:: us all up." 
 
"Oh, no;" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Scarecrow; "this Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: a coward." 
 
"Really?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Mouse. 
 
"He says|say%2:32:00:: so himself," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and he would never|never%4:02:00:: 
hurt|hurt%1:12:02:: anyone who is|be%2:42:06:: our friend. If you will help|help%2:41:00:: us to save|save%2:41:01:: him I 
promise|promise%1:10:00:: that he shall treat|treat%2:41:00:: you all with kindness." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Queen, "we will trust|trust%2:31:00:: you. But what shall we do?" 
 
"Are there|there%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: of these mice|mouse%1:05:00:: which call|call%2:32:02:: you Queen|queen%1:18:00:: and are|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to 
obey|obey%2:41:00:: you?" 
 
"Oh, yes; there are|be%2:42:00:: thousands," she replied. 
 
"Then send|send%2:38:01:: for them all to come|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible, and let|let%2:41:00:: 
each one bring|bring%2:38:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: piece|piece%1:06:00:: of string." 
 
The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: to the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: that attended|attend%2:41:00:: her and told|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: at 
once|once%4:02:00:: and get|get%2:35:03:: all her people. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they heard|hear%2:39:00:: her orders|order%1:10:03:: they 
ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: in every direction|direction%1:15:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as possible. 
 
"Now," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "you must go|go%2:38:00:: to those 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: by the river-side and make|make%2:36:01:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: that will carry|carry%2:35:02:: the Lion." 
 
So the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: went|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:00:: to the trees|tree%1:20:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to work; and he 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: a truck|truck%1:06:00:: out of the limbs|limb%1:20:00:: of trees, from which he chopped|chop%2:35:01:: 
away|away%4:02:00:: all the leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: and branches. He fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: it together|together%4:02:02:: with 
wooden|wooden%3:00:00:woody:00 pegs|peg%2:35:00:: and made|make%2:36:00:: the four wheels|wheel%1:06:00:: out of short|short%3:00:01:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: 
tree-trunk. So|so%4:02:02:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: and so|so%4:02:02:: well|well%4:02:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: he work|work%2:41:02:: that by the time|time%1:11:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
began|begin%2:30:00:: to arrive|arrive%2:38:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: all ready|ready%3:00:00:: for them. 
 
They came|come%2:38:00:: from all directions, and there were|be%2:42:03:: thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of them: big|big%3:00:01:: 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: and middle-sized mice; and each one brought|bring%2:38:00:: a 
piece|piece%1:11:00:: of string|string%1:06:00:: in his mouth. It was|be%2:42:04:: about this time|time%1:11:00:: that Dorothy woke|wake%2:29:01:: 
from her long|long%3:00:02:: sleep|sleep%1:26:00:: and opened|open%2:35:00:: her eyes. She was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: astonished|astonish%2:31:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: herself lying|lie%2:35:00:: upon the grass, with thousands|thousand%1:23:00:: of mice|mouse%1:05:00:: standing|stand%2:42:02:: 
around|around%4:02:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: at her timidly. But the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her about 
everything, and turning|turn%2:38:00:: to the dignified|dignified%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Mouse, he said, 
 
"Permit me to introduce|introduce%2:32:00:: to you her Majesty, the Queen." 
 
Dorothy nodded|nod%2:32:00:: gravely|gravely%4:02:00:: and the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: made|make%2:41:00:: a courtesy, after which she 
became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: with the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to fasten|fasten%2:35:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: to the 
truck, using|use%2:34:01:: the strings|string%1:06:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: brought. One end|end%1:15:00:: of a string|string%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: 
tied|tie%2:35:00:: around the neck|neck%1:08:00:: of each mouse|mouse%1:05:00:: and the other|other%3:00:00:: end|end%1:15:00:: to the truck. 
Of course|course%1:15:00:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a thousand times|time%1:28:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than any of the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: 
who were|be%2:42:03:: to draw|draw%2:35:01:: it; but when all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: they 
were|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to pull|pull%2:35:00:: it quite|quite%4:02:02:: easily. Even|even%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: could sit|sit%2:35:00:: on it, and were|be%2:42:03:: drawn|draw%2:35:06:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: by their queer|queer%1:18:00:: little|little%4:02:00:: 
horses|horse%1:05:00:: to the place|place%1:15:00:: where the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: asleep. 
 
 
 
After a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of hard|hard%3:00:06:: work, for the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heavy, they managed|manage%2:41:08:: 
to get|get%2:30:02:: him up|up%4:02:00:: on the truck. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: hurriedly|hurriedly%4:02:00:: gave|give%2:40:02:: her people|people%1:14:01:: 
the order|order%1:10:03:: to start, for she feared|fear%2:37:03:: if the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: stayed|stay%2:42:02:: among the 
poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: they also|also%4:02:00:: would fall|fall%2:30:08:: asleep. 
 
 
 
At first|first%4:02:02:: the little|little%3:00:01:: creatures, many|many%3:00:00:: though they were, could hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: stir|stir%2:38:00:: 
the heavily|heavily%4:02:00:: loaded|loaded%3:00:00:full:00 truck; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: both pushed|push%2:41:00:: 
from behind, and they got|get%2:30:00:: along better. Soon|soon%4:02:00:: they rolled|roll%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of the poppy|poppy%1:20:00:: bed|bed%1:06:01:: to the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields, where he could breathe|breathe%2:29:00:: the sweet, 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: again, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the poisonous|poisonous%3:00:00:toxic:00 scent|scent%1:09:01:: of the flowers. 
 
Dorothy came|come%2:38:00:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 mice|mouse%1:05:00:: warmly|warmly%4:02:00:: for 
saving|save%2:41:01:: her companion|companion%1:18:00:: from death. She had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the big|big%3:00:00:conspicuous:00 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: rescued. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: unharnessed from the truck|truck%1:06:00:: and scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the grass|grass%1:20:00:: to their homes. The Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the last|last%3:00:00:: 
to leave. 
 
"If ever|ever%4:02:04:: you need|need%2:42:00:: us again," she said, "come out|out%4:02:04:: into the field|field%1:15:00:: and 
call, and we shall hear|hear%2:39:00:: you and come|come%2:38:04:: to your assistance. Good|good%1:06:00:: bye!" 
 
"Good bye!" they all answered, and away|away%4:02:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:00:: ran, while Dorothy 
held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto tightly|tightly%4:02:02:: lest he should run|run%2:38:00:: after her and frighten her. 
 
After this they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: until he should awaken; and 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: Dorothy some fruit|fruit%1:20:00:: from a tree|tree%1:20:00:: near by, which 
she ate|eat%2:34:00:: for her dinner. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: X. 
 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: some time|time%1:28:05:: before the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: awakened, for he had|have%2:39:06:: lain|lie%2:35:00:: 
among the poppies|poppy%1:20:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: while, breathing|breathing%1:04:00:: in their deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fragrance; 
but when he did|do%2:41:01:: open|open%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and roll|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: the truck|truck%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: 
to find|find%2:39:01:: himself still|still%4:02:01:: alive. 
 
"I ran|run%2:38:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as I could," he said, sitting|sit%2:38:00:: down and yawning; "but 
the flowers|flower%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: for me. How did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:30:00:: me out?" 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: they told|tell%2:32:01:: him of the field-mice, and how they had|have%2:40:00:: generously|generously%4:02:00:: 
saved|save%2:41:01:: him from death; and the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: laughed, and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:01:: myself very|very%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: and terrible; yet|yet%4:02:02:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:06:01:: as flowers|flower%1:20:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: near to killing|kill%2:35:00:: me, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 small|small%3:00:00:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: as 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: saved|save%2:41:01:: my life. How strange|strange%3:00:00:: it all is! But, comrades, what 
shall we do|do%2:36:01:: now?" 
 
"We must journey|journey%1:04:00:: on until we find|find%2:40:02:: the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: again," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "and then|then%4:02:00:: we can keep|keep%2:42:07:: on|on%4:02:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
So, the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: fully|fully%4:02:02:: refreshed, and feeling|feeling%1:09:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: himself again, 
they all started|start%2:30:00:: upon the journey, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: enjoying|enjoy%2:37:00:: the walk|walk%1:04:03:: through 
the soft, fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: grass; and it was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: before they reached|reach%2:38:00:: the 
road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick|brick%1:06:00:: and turned|turn%2:38:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: toward the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: where 
the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz dwelt. 
 
 
 
The road|road%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: and well|well%4:02:00:: paved, now, and the country|country%1:15:01:: about was|be%2:42:03:: 
beautiful; so that the travelers|traveler%1:18:00:: rejoiced|rejoice%2:37:00:: in leaving|leave%2:38:01:: the forest|forest%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: 
behind, and with it the many|many%3:00:00:: dangers|danger%1:26:01:: they had|have%2:39:06:: met|meet%2:38:01:: in its gloomy|gloomy%3:00:00:depressing:00 
shades. Once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%4:02:00:: they could see|see%2:39:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: built|build%2:36:00:: beside the road; but 
these were|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green, and when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: house, in 
which a farmer|farmer%1:18:00:: evidently|evidently%4:02:00:: lived, that also|also%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: painted|paint%2:35:00:: green. They 
passed|pass%2:38:05:: by several|several%3:00:00:some:00 of these houses|house%1:06:00:: during the afternoon, and sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: 
people|people%1:14:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to the doors|door%1:06:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at them as if they would like|like%2:37:01:: to 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: questions; but no one|one%1:23:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near them nor spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them because of 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion, of which they were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: afraid. The people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in clothing|clothing%1:06:00:: of a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 emerald green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: peaked|peaked%3:00:00:ill:01 
hats|hat%1:06:00:: like those of the Munchkins. 
 
 
 
"This must be|be%2:42:06:: the Land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "and we are|be%2:42:06:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: 
getting|get%2:30:00:: near the Emerald City." 
 
"Yes," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "everything is|be%2:42:03:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 here, while in 
the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Munchkins blue|blue%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: the favorite|favorite%3:00:00:loved:00 color. But the 
people|people%1:14:00:: do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: friendly|friendly%3:00:01:: as the Munchkins and I'm afraid|afraid%3:00:00:concerned:00 
we shall be|be%2:42:03:: unable|unable%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a place|place%1:15:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night." 
 
"I should like|like%2:37:01:: something to eat|eat%2:34:00:: besides fruit," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: Toto is|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: starved. Let|let%1:14:00:: us stop|stop%2:38:00:: at the next|next%3:00:00:close:01 house|house%1:06:00:: and 
talk|talk%2:32:01:: to the people." 
 
So, when they came|come%2:38:04:: to a good|good%3:00:00:ample:00 sized|size%2:30:00:: farm|farm%1:06:00:: house, Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: 
up to the door|door%1:06:00:: and knocked. A|a%1:10:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: it just|just%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: 
out, and said, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you want, child, and why is|be%2:42:03:: that great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: with you?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to pass|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: with you, if you will allow|allow%2:32:00:: us," answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
Dorothy; "and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: my friend|friend%1:18:00:: and comrade, and would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: 
you for the world." 
 
"Is he tame?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the woman, opening|open%2:35:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: wider. 
 
"Oh, yes;" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl, "and he is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 coward, too; so that he 
will be|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of you than you are|be%2:42:03:: of him." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the woman, after thinking|think%2:31:00:: it over and taking|take%2:34:00:: another 
peep|peep%1:04:00:: at the Lion, "if that is|be%2:42:06:: the case|case%1:09:00:: you may come|come%2:38:00:: in, and I will 
give|give%2:40:00:: you some supper|supper%1:13:00:: and a place|place%1:15:00:: to sleep." 
 
So they all entered|enter%2:38:00:: the house, where there|there%4:02:00:: were, besides the woman, 
two children|child%1:18:00:: and a man. The man|man%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: his leg, and was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: on the 
couch|couch%1:06:00:: in a corner. They seemed|seem%2:39:00:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: so|so%4:02:02:: strange|strange%3:00:00:: a 
company, and while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: busy|busy%3:00:00:: laying|lay%2:35:01:: the table|table%1:06:01:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:03:: you all going?" 
 
"To the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz." 
 
"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man. "Are you sure|sure%3:00:00:: that Oz will see|see%2:38:00:: you?" 
 
"Why not?" she replied. 
 
"Why, it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: that he never|never%4:02:00:: lets|let%2:41:00:: any one come|come%2:38:00:: into his presence. I 
have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:05:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: times, and it is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and 
wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place; but I have|have%2:41:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: permitted|permit%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Oz, 
nor do|do%2:41:01:: I know|know%2:31:00:: of any living|live%2:42:00:: person|person%1:03:00:: who has|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him." 
 
"Does he never|never%4:02:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: out?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Never. He sits|sit%2:35:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: after day|day%1:28:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: of his palace, 
and even|even%4:02:00:: those who wait|wait%2:42:00:: upon him do|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: him face|face%2:38:00:: to face." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:03:: he like?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to tell," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 Wizard, and can take|take%2:30:01:: on|on%4:02:00:: any form|form%1:09:00:: he wishes. So|so%4:02:02:: that some say|say%2:32:01:: he 
looks|look%2:39:01:: like a bird; and some say|say%2:32:01:: he looks|look%2:42:02:: like an elephant; and some 
say|say%2:32:00:: he looks|look%2:39:01:: like a cat. To others he appears|appear%2:39:00:: as a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: fairy, 
or a brownie, or in any other|other%3:00:00:: form|form%1:03:00:: that pleases|please%2:37:00:: him. But who the real|real%1:23:00:: 
Oz is, when he is|be%2:42:03:: in his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 form, no living|live%2:42:04:: person|person%1:03:00:: can tell." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:same:02 strange," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "but we must try, in some way, 
to see|see%2:39:02:: him, or we shall have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: our journey|journey%1:04:00:: for nothing." 
 
 
 
"Why do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Oz?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man. 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:00:: me some brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, eagerly. 
 
"Oh, Oz could do|do%2:41:01:: that easily|easily%4:02:01:: enough," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the man. "He has|have%2:40:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: 
brains|brain%1:18:00:: than he needs." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That will not|not%4:02:00:: trouble|trouble%1:11:00:: him," continued|continue%2:42:01:: the man, "for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: a large|large%3:00:00:: 
collection|collection%1:14:00:: of hearts, of all sizes|size%1:07:00:: and shapes." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Oz keeps|keep%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pot|pot%1:23:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: in his throne|throne%1:06:00:: room," said|say%2:32:00:: the man, 
"which he has|have%2:40:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 plate, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: it from running|run%2:38:01:: 
over. He will be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: you some." 
 
"And I want|want%2:37:00:: him to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: Kansas?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in surprise. 
 
"I don't know," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sorrowfully; "but it is|be%2:42:06:: my home, and 
I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: it's somewhere." 
 
"Very likely. Well, Oz can do|do%2:41:04:: anything; so I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: he will find|find%2:38:10:: 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for you. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must get|get%2:30:00:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him, and that will be|be%2:42:06:: 
a hard|hard%3:00:06:: task; for the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: does|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: anyone, and 
he usually|usually%4:02:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 way. But what do|do%2:41:04:: you want?" he continued, 
speaking|speak%2:32:01:: to Toto. Toto only|only%4:02:01:: wagged|wag%2:38:00:: his tail; for, strange|strange%3:00:00:: to say, he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: speak. 
 
 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: called|call%2:32:09:: to them that supper|supper%1:13:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready, so they gathered|gather%2:41:00:: 
around the table|table%1:06:01:: and Dorothy ate|eat%2:34:00:: some delicious|delicious%3:00:00:tasty:00 porridge|porridge%1:13:00:: and a dish|dish%1:06:00:: of 
scrambled|scramble%2:35:02:: eggs|egg%1:13:00:: and a plate|plate%1:23:00:: of nice|nice%3:00:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: bread, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: her meal. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: some of the porridge, but did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: care|care%2:37:00:: for it, saying|say%2:32:00:: it 
was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:11:: from oats|oat%1:13:00:: and oats|oat%1:13:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: food|food%1:03:00:: for horses, not|not%4:02:00:: for lions. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: ate|eat%2:34:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: at all. Toto ate|eat%2:34:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: of 
everything, and was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to get|get%2:40:00:: a good|good%3:00:01:: supper|supper%1:13:00:: again. 
 
The woman|woman%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: gave|give%2:40:00:: Dorothy a bed|bed%1:06:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: in, and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside 
her, while the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: the door|door%1:06:00:: of her room|room%1:06:00:: so she might not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
disturbed. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a corner|corner%1:15:02:: and 
kept|keep%2:42:00:: quiet|quiet%3:00:02:: all night, although of course|course%1:17:00:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: up, they started|start%2:30:00:: on their 
way, and soon|soon%4:02:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: in the sky|sky%1:17:00:: just|just%4:02:04:: before them. 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
As they walked|walk%2:38:00:: on, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glow|glow%1:07:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: brighter and brighter, and it 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they were|be%2:42:03:: nearing|near%2:38:00:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of their travels. Yet it 
was|be%2:42:03:: afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: before they came|come%2:38:04:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: that surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: the 
City. It was|be%2:42:03:: high, and thick, and of a bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color. 
 
In front|front%1:15:00:: of them, and at the end|end%1:15:00:: of the road|road%1:06:00:: of yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brick, was|be%2:42:05:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
gate, all studded|stud%2:42:00:: with emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: that glittered|glitter%2:39:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: in the sun|sun%1:19:00:: that even|even%4:02:00:: 
the painted|painted%3:00:00:artificial:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by their brilliancy. 
 
There was|be%2:42:04:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed|push%2:38:02:: the button|button%1:06:01:: and 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: a silvery|silvery%3:00:00:bright:00 tinkle|tinkle%1:11:00:: sound|sound%1:09:00:: within. Then|then%4:02:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: gate|gate%1:06:00:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
open, and they all passed|pass%2:38:00:: through and found|find%2:39:05:: themselves in a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: room, the walls|wall%1:06:00:: of which glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: with countless|countless%3:00:00:incalculable:00 emeralds. 
 
Before them stood|stand%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: about the same|same%3:00:00:: size|size%1:07:00:: as the Munchkins. 
He was|be%2:42:03:: clothed|clothe%2:29:00:: all in green, from his head|head%1:08:00:: to his feet, and even|even%4:02:00:: his 
skin|skin%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: of a greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint. At his side|side%1:15:02:: was|be%2:42:05:: a large|large%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box. 
 
When he saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy and her companions|companion%1:18:00:: the man|man%1:18:00:: asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:36:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:02:: in the Emerald City?" 
 
"We came|come%2:38:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
The man|man%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: surprised|surprised%3:00:00:: at this answer|answer%1:10:00:: that he sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it 
over. 
 
"It has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: since anyone asked|ask%2:32:01:: me to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz," he said, 
shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: in perplexity. "He is|be%2:42:03:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: and terrible, and if 
you come|come%2:38:04:: on an idle|idle%3:00:00:frivolous:00 or foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand|errand%1:04:00:: to bother|bother%2:41:01:: the wise|wise%3:00:00:: reflections|reflection%1:09:00:: of 
the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Wizard, he might be|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: you all in an instant." 
 
 
 
"But it is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a foolish|foolish%3:00:00:: errand, nor an idle|idle%3:00:00:: one," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow; "it is|be%2:42:03:: important. And we have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: told|tell%2:32:01:: that Oz is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:00:reputable:00 
Wizard." 
 
"So he is," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man; "and he rules|rule%2:41:00:: the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: wisely|wisely%4:02:00:: 
and well. But to those who are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: honest, or who approach|approach%2:32:00:: him from 
curiosity, he is|be%2:42:03:: most|most%4:02:01:: terrible, and few|few%3:00:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: dared|dare%2:41:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
his face. I am|be%2:42:06:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates, and since you demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz I must take|take%2:38:09:: you to his palace. But first|first%4:02:00:: you must put|put%2:35:00:: on 
the spectacles." 
 
"Why?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Because if you did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wear|wear%2:29:04:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: the brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: and glory|glory%1:07:00:: of 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: would blind|blind%3:00:00:: you. Even|even%4:02:00:: those who live|live%2:42:08:: in the City|city%1:15:01:: 
must wear|wear%2:29:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: night|night%1:28:00:: and day. They are|be%2:42:03:: all locked|lock%2:35:01:: on, for Oz 
so|so%4:02:05:: ordered|order%2:32:00:: it when the City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: first|first%3:00:00:: built, and I have|have%2:40:00:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 key|key%1:06:00:: 
that will unlock|unlock%2:35:00:: them." 
 
 
 
He opened|open%2:35:00:: the big|big%3:00:01:: box, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: of every size|size%1:07:00:: and shape. All of them had|have%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: 
in them. The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the gates|gate%1:06:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: that would just|just%4:02:00:: fit|fit%2:42:02:: 
Dorothy and put|put%2:35:00:: them over her eyes. There were|be%2:42:04:: two golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 bands|band%1:06:00:: 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: to them that passed|pass%2:42:08:: around the back|back%1:06:00:: of her head, where they 
were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: by a little|little%3:00:01:: key|key%1:06:00:: that was|be%2:42:05:: at the end|end%1:15:00:: of a chain|chain%1:06:00:: the 
Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: around his neck. When they were|be%2:42:03:: on, Dorothy 
could not|not%4:02:00:: take|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: she wished, but of course|course%1:15:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:34:00:: 
to be|be%2:42:03:: blinded|blind%2:39:01:: by the glare|glare%1:07:00:: of the Emerald City, so she said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 man|man%1:18:00:: fitted|fitted%3:44:00:: spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: for the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and even|even%4:02:00:: on little|little%3:00:01:: Toto; and all were|be%2:42:03:: locked|lock%2:35:00:: 
fast|fast%4:02:02:: with the key. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: put|put%2:35:00:: on his own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: and told|tell%2:32:04:: them 
he was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to show|show%2:32:01:: them to the palace. Taking|take%2:35:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 key|key%1:06:00:: from 
a peg|peg%2:35:00:: on the wall|wall%1:06:00:: he opened|open%2:35:00:: another gate, and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him 
through the portal|portal%1:06:01:: into the streets|street%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XI. 
 
 
Even|even%4:02:00:: with eyes|eye%1:08:00:: protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: Dorothy and her 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: at first|first%4:02:02:: dazzled|dazzle%2:39:00:: by the brilliancy|brilliancy%1:07:00:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 City. 
The streets|street%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lined|line%2:35:00:: with beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: all built|build%2:36:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
and studded|stud%2:42:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: with sparkling|sparkling%3:00:00:starry:00 emeralds. They walked|walk%2:38:00:: over a 
pavement|pavement%1:06:01:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble, and where the blocks|block%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: joined|join%2:35:01:: 
together|together%4:02:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: rows|row%1:14:00:: of emeralds, set|set%2:35:02:: closely, and glittering in the 
brightness|brightness%1:07:00:: of the sun. The window|window%1:06:04:: panes|pane%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glass; even|even%4:02:00:: the 
sky|sky%1:17:00:: above the City|city%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 tint, and the rays|ray%1:19:00:: of the sun|sun%1:17:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: green. 
 
There were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: people, men, women|woman%1:18:00:: and children, walking|walking%1:04:00:: about, and 
these were|be%2:42:03:: all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and had|have%2:40:00:: greenish|greenish%3:00:00:chromatic:00 skins. They 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy and her strangely|strangely%4:02:01:: assorted|assorted%3:00:00:heterogeneous:00 company|company%1:26:00:: with wondering|wonder%2:32:12:: 
eyes, and the children|child%1:18:00:: all ran|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: and hid|hide%2:39:01:: behind their mothers|mother%1:18:00:: when 
they saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Lion; but no one|one%1:23:00:: spoke|speak%2:32:00:: to them. Many|many%3:00:00:: shops|shop%1:06:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the 
street, and Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: that everything in them was|be%2:42:03:: green. Green|green%1:07:00:: 
candy|candy%1:13:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pop-corn were|be%2:42:03:: offered|offer%2:40:00:: for sale, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:08:: as green|green%1:07:00:: 
shoes, green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hats|hat%1:06:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of all sorts. At one place|place%1:15:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: selling|sell%2:40:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 lemonade, and when the children|child%1:18:00:: bought|buy%2:40:00:: it Dorothy 
could see|see%2:39:00:: that they paid|pay%2:40:00:: for it with green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pennies. 
 
There seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:04:: no horses|horse%1:05:00:: nor animals|animal%1:03:00:: of any kind; the men|man%1:18:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: 
things|thing%1:06:00:: around|around%4:02:06:: in little|little%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carts, which they pushed|push%2:38:00:: before them. 
Everyone seemed|seem%2:39:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and contented|contented%3:00:00:: and prosperous. 
 
The Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: led|lead%2:38:00:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: until they 
came|come%2:38:00:: to a big|big%3:00:01:: building, exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the City, which was|be%2:42:05:: 
the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard. There was|be%2:42:04:: a soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: before the 
door, dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 uniform|uniform%1:06:00:: and wearing|wear%2:29:00:: a long|long%3:00:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 beard. 
 
"Here are|be%2:42:04:: strangers," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates|gate%1:06:00:: to him, "and 
they demand|demand%2:32:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Oz." 
 
"Step inside," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and I will carry|carry%2:35:02:: your message|message%1:10:01:: 
to him." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the Palace|palace%1:14:00:: gates|gate%1:06:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: led|lead%2:38:01:: into a big|big%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: 
with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 carpet|carpet%1:06:00:: and lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 furniture|furniture%1:06:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: with emeralds. 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: made|make%2:32:00:: them all wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: their feet|foot%1:08:01:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 mat|mat%1:06:00:: before 
entering|enter%2:38:00:: this room, and when they were|be%2:42:03:: seated|seat%2:35:00:: he said, politely, 
 
"Please make|make%2:30:00:: yourselves comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: while I go|go%2:38:00:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: of the 
Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:00:: Oz you are|be%2:42:05:: here." 
 
They had|have%2:40:01:: to wait|wait%2:42:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: before the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: returned. When, at 
last, he came|come%2:38:00:: back, Dorothy asked, 
 
"Have you seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz?" 
 
 
 
"Oh, no;" returned|return%2:32:01:: the soldier; "I have|have%2:40:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him. But I spoke|speak%2:32:00:: 
to him as he sat|sit%2:42:00:: behind his screen, and gave|give%2:40:00:: him your message. He 
says|say%2:32:00:: he will grant|grant%2:40:01:: you an audience, if you so|so%4:02:05:: desire; but each one 
of you must enter|enter%2:38:00:: his presence|presence%1:15:00:: alone, and he will admit|admit%2:41:01:: but one each 
day. Therefore, as you must remain|remain%2:42:03:: in the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 days, I 
will have|have%2:30:00:: you shown|show%2:38:00:: to rooms|room%1:06:00:: where you may rest|rest%2:32:00:: in comfort|comfort%1:26:00:: after your 
journey." 
 
"Thank you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the girl; "that is|be%2:42:03:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 kind|kind%1:09:00:: of Oz." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: blew|blow%2:29:00:: upon a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whistle, and at once|once%4:02:02:: a young|young%3:00:00:: girl, 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in a pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, entered|enter%2:38:00:: the room. She had|have%2:42:00:: 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 hair|hair%1:08:00:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 eyes, and she bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy as 
she said, 
 
"Follow me and I will show|show%2:32:01:: you your room." 
 
So Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye to all her friends|friend%1:18:00:: except Toto, and taking|take%2:31:03:: 
the dog|dog%1:05:00:: in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: through seven passages|passage%1:08:00:: 
and up|up%4:02:00:: three flights|flight%1:06:00:: of stairs|stair%1:06:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a room|room%1:06:00:: at the front|front%1:15:00:: 
of the Palace. It was|be%2:42:03:: the sweetest|sweet%3:00:02:pleasing:00 little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: in the world, with 
a soft, comfortable|comfortable%3:00:00:: bed|bed%1:06:00:: that had|have%2:42:00:: sheets|sheet%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: and a green|green%1:07:00:: 
velvet|velvet%1:06:00:: counterpane. There was|be%2:42:04:: a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 fountain|fountain%1:06:02:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the 
room, that shot|shoot%2:38:03:: a spray|spray%1:11:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 perfume|perfume%1:06:00:: into the air, to fall|fall%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: 
into a beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved|carve%2:35:01:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: basin. Beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the windows, and there was|be%2:42:04:: a shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: with a row|row%1:14:00:: of little|little%3:00:01:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 books. When Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to open|open%2:35:00:: these books|book%1:06:00:: she found|find%2:40:02:: them 
full|full%3:00:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 pictures|picture%1:06:00:: that made|make%2:32:00:: her laugh, they were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: funny. 
 
In a wardrobe|wardrobe%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 dresses, made|make%2:42:05:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and satin|satin%1:06:00:: and 
velvet; and all of them fitted|fit%2:42:05:: Dorothy exactly. 
 
"Make yourself perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: at home," said|say%2:32:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "and if you 
wish|wish%1:10:01:: for anything ring|ring%1:11:00:: the bell. Oz will send|send%2:32:00:: for you to-morrow 
morning." 
 
She left|leave%2:31:05:: Dorothy alone|alone%4:02:01:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the others. These she also|also%4:02:00:: 
led|lead%2:38:01:: to rooms, and each one of them found|find%2:39:01:: himself lodged|lodge%2:42:00:: in a very|very%4:02:00:: 
pleasant|pleasant%3:00:00:: part|part%1:24:00:: of the Palace. Of course|course%1:15:00:: this politeness|politeness%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: wasted|waste%2:34:05:: on 
the Scarecrow; for when he found|find%2:39:05:: himself alone|alone%4:02:01:: in his room|room%1:06:00:: he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
stupidly|stupidly%4:02:00:: in one spot, just|just%4:02:05:: within the doorway, to wait|wait%2:42:00:: till morning. 
It would not|not%4:02:00:: rest|rest%2:32:01:: him to lie|lie%2:38:00:: down, and he could not|not%4:02:00:: close|close%2:35:00:: his eyes; 
so|so%4:02:09:: he remained|remain%2:42:03:: all night|night%1:28:00:: staring|star%2:30:00:: at a little|little%3:00:01:: spider|spider%1:05:00:: which was|be%2:42:03:: weaving|weave%2:36:00:: 
its web|web%1:06:00:: in a corner|corner%1:06:02:: of the room, just|just%4:02:05:: as if it were|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: one of the 
most|most%4:02:01:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: in the world. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his 
bed|bed%1:06:00:: from force|force%1:04:00:: of habit, for he remembered|remember%2:31:00:: when he was|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of flesh; 
but not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: he passed|pass%2:42:00:: the night|night%1:28:00:: moving|move%2:38:01:: his joints|joint%1:08:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
and down|down%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:careful:00 they kept|keep%2:42:07:: in good|good%3:00:01:: working|work%2:35:02:: order. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would 
have|have%2:40:00:: preferred|prefer%2:37:00:: a bed|bed%1:06:01:: of dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: in the forest, and did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: 
being|be%2:42:03:: shut|shut%2:41:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a room; but he had|have%2:40:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: sense|sense%1:09:04:: to let|let%2:41:00:: this worry|worry%1:09:00:: 
him, so he sprang|spring%2:38:01:: upon the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: like a cat|cat%1:05:00:: and 
purred|purr%2:32:00:: himself asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: in a minute. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning, after breakfast, the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 maiden|maiden%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to fetch|fetch%2:35:00:: 
Dorothy, and she dressed|dress%2:29:01:: her in one of the prettiest|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 gowns--made of 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 brocaded|brocaded%3:00:00:adorned:00 satin. Dorothy put|put%2:35:05:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: apron|apron%1:06:00:: and tied|tie%2:35:00:: a 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck, and they started|start%2:38:02:: for the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: 
of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
 
 
First|first%4:02:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 hall|hall%1:06:02:: in which were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: ladies|lady%1:18:01:: and 
gentlemen|gentleman%1:18:00:: of the court, all dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in rich|rich%3:00:00:: costumes. These people|people%1:14:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: but talk|talk%2:32:01:: to each other, but they always|always%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to 
wait|wait%2:42:00:: outside the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: every morning, although they were|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: 
permitted|permit%2:41:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: As Dorothy entered|enter%2:38:00:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: at her curiously, 
and one of them whispered, 
 
"Are you really|really%4:02:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: upon the face|face%1:08:00:: of Oz the Terrible?" 
 
"Of course," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the girl, "if he will see|see%2:41:11:: me." 
 
"Oh, he will see|see%2:38:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: who had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:40:00:: her message|message%1:10:01:: 
to the Wizard, "although he does|do%2:36:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to have|have%2:40:00:: people|people%1:14:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
him. Indeed, at first|first%4:02:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: I should send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: 
where you came|come%2:42:09:: from. Then|then%4:02:00:: he asked|ask%2:32:00:: me what you looked|look%2:39:01:: like, and when 
I mentioned|mention%2:32:02:: your silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: interested. At last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 I|i%1:27:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him about the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead, and he decided|decide%2:31:00:: he would 
admit|admit%2:41:01:: you to his presence." 
 
Just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:00:: a bell|bell%1:06:00:: rang, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: the signal. You must go|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: alone." 
 
She opened|open%2:35:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: door|door%1:06:00:: and Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: through and found|find%2:30:13:: 
herself in a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 place. It was|be%2:42:03:: a big, round|round%1:13:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: with a high|high%3:00:01:: 
arched|arched%3:01:00:: roof, and the walls|wall%1:06:00:: and ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and floor|floor%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with 
large|large%3:00:00:: emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: set|set%2:35:02:: closely|closely%4:02:00:: together. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the roof|roof%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 light, as|as%4:02:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:: as the sun, which made|make%2:30:00:: the emeralds|emerald%1:27:00:: sparkle|sparkle%1:07:00:: in 
a wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 manner. 
 
But what interested|interest%2:42:00:: Dorothy most|most%3:00:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 marble|marble%1:27:00:: 
that stood|stand%2:35:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the room. It was|be%2:42:03:: shaped|shape%2:30:00:: like a chair|chair%1:06:00:: 
and sparkled|sparkle%2:43:00:: with gems, as did|do%2:36:01:: everything else. In the center|center%1:15:01:: of the 
chair|chair%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: an enormous|enormous%3:00:00:large:00 Head, without body|body%1:08:01:: to support|support%2:35:00:: it or any arms|arm%1:08:00:: or 
legs|leg%1:08:02:: whatever. There was|be%2:42:04:: no hair|hair%1:08:00:: upon this head, but it had|have%2:40:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and 
nose|nose%1:08:00:: and mouth, and was|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the head|head%1:08:00:: of the biggest|big%3:00:01:: giant. 
 
As Dorothy gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon this in wonder|wonder%1:12:00:: and fear|fear%2:37:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: slowly|slowly%4:02:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply|sharply%4:02:02:: and steadily. Then|then%4:02:00:: the mouth|mouth%1:08:00:: moved, and 
Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: a voice|voice%1:10:00:: say: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 an awful|awful%3:00:00:bad:00 voice|voice%1:07:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to come|come%2:42:04:: from the 
big|big%3:00:01:: Head; so she took|take%2:41:04:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: and answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy, the Small|small%1:08:00:: and Meek. I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: to you for help." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her thoughtfully|thoughtfully%4:02:00:: for a full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 minute. Then|then%4:02:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: the 
voice: 
 
"Where did|do%2:36:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes?" 
 
"I got|get%2:40:00:: them from the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the East, when my house|house%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: on 
her and killed|kill%2:35:00:: her," she replied. 
 
"Where did|do%2:41:01:: you get|get%2:40:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon your forehead?" continued|continue%2:42:01:: the voice. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: where the good|good%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: me when she bade|bid%2:32:00:: me 
good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: and sent|send%2:38:01:: me to you," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
Again|again%4:02:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at her sharply, and they saw|saw%2:35:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: telling|tell%2:32:04:: 
the truth. Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz asked, 
 
"What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish|wish%2:37:00:: me to do?" 
 
"Send me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, where my Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: are," she 
answered, earnestly. "I don't like your country, although it is|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
beautiful. And I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: will be|be%2:42:03:: dreadfully|dreadfully%4:02:00:: worried|worry%2:37:00:: over my 
being|be%2:42:03:: away|away%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long." 
 
The eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:29:00:: three times, and then|then%4:02:00:: they turned|turn%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: and 
down|down%4:02:00:: to the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: queerly|queerly%4:02:01:: that they seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room. And at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 they looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy again. 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and I am|be%2:42:03:: weak; because you are|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: 
and I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a helpless|helpless%3:00:01:powerless:00 little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," she answered. 
 
"But you were|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"That just|just%4:02:01:: happened," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy, simply; "I could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it." 
 
"Well," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head, "I will give|give%2:40:07:: you my answer. You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: 
to expect|expect%2:32:00:: me to send|send%2:38:01:: you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: unless you do|do%2:41:01:: something for 
me in return. In this country|country%1:14:01:: everyone must pay|pay%2:40:00:: for everything he 
gets. If you wish|wish%2:37:02:: me to use|use%2:34:01:: my magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 power|power%1:07:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: you home|home%1:15:02:: again|again%4:02:00:: you 
must do|do%2:41:01:: something for me first. Help|help%2:41:00:: me and I will help|help%2:41:00:: you." 
 
"What must I|i%1:27:00:: do?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Kill the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"But I cannot!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy, greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised. 
 
"You killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and you wear|wear%2:29:00:: the silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 shoes, 
which bear|bear%2:42:14:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm. There is|be%2:42:00:: now|now%4:02:00:: but one Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: 
in all this land, and when you can tell|tell%2:32:00:: me she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will send|send%2:35:00:: 
you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas--but not|not%4:02:00:: before." 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to weep, she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed; and the 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: winked|wink%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: upon her anxiously, as if the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz 
felt|feel%2:31:00:: that she could help|help%2:41:00:: him if she would. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: anything, willingly," she sobbed; "and even|even%4:02:00:: if I wanted|want%2:37:00:: 
to, how could I kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch? If you, who are|be%2:42:06:: Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 and 
Terrible, cannot kill|kill%2:35:00:: her yourself, how do|do%2:41:01:: you expect|expect%2:31:00:: me to do|do%2:41:01:: it?" 
 
 
 
"I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know," said|say%2:32:00:: the Head; "but that is|be%2:42:06:: my answer, and until the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:offensive:01 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: dies|die%2:30:00:: you will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: your Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: again. Remember|remember%2:31:01:: 
that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be|be%2:42:03:: killed. 
Now|now%4:02:02:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: ask|ask%2:32:01:: to see|see%2:38:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:04:: your task." 
 
Sorrowfully Dorothy left|leave%2:38:01:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: where the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: what 
Oz had|have%2:40:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to her. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no hope|hope%1:09:00:: for me," she said, sadly, "for Oz will not|not%4:02:00:: send|send%2:38:01:: me 
home|home%1:15:04:: until I have|have%2:40:00:: killed|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West; and that I can 
never|never%4:02:00:: do." 
 
Her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: sorry, but could do|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: her; so she went|go%2:38:01:: 
to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 room|room%1:06:00:: and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the bed|bed%1:06:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: herself to sleep. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and said, 
 
"Come with me, for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you." 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and was|be%2:42:03:: admitted|admit%2:41:01:: into the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room, where he saw, sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in the emerald throne, a most|most%4:02:01:: lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady. She was|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gauze|gauze%1:06:00:: and wore|wear%2:29:00:: upon her flowing|flow%2:35:04:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 locks|lock%1:08:00:: a crown|crown%1:06:02:: of jewels. Growing|grow%2:30:02:: from her shoulders|shoulder%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: wings, 
gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 in color|color%1:07:00:: and so|so%4:02:02:: light|light%3:00:01:: that they fluttered|flutter%2:38:02:: if the slightest|slight%3:00:00:insignificant:00 
breath|breath%1:19:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: reached|reach%2:32:00:: them. 
 
When the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: bowed, as|as%4:02:00:: prettily|prettily%4:02:00:: as his straw|straw%1:27:00:: stuffing|stuff%2:30:02:: would 
let|let%2:41:00:: him, before this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: creature, she looked|look%2:39:00:: upon him sweetly, 
and said, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, who had|have%2:39:06:: expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head|head%1:18:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:42:00:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: him of, was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: astonished; but he answered|answer%2:32:00:: her bravely. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: only|only%4:02:02:: a Scarecrow, stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with straw. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no 
brains, and I come|come%2:38:00:: to you praying|pray%2:32:00:: that you will put|put%2:35:00:: brains|brain%1:08:00:: in my head|head%1:09:00:: 
instead|instead%4:02:01:: of straw, so that I may become|become%2:42:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: a man|man%1:18:00:: as any other|other%3:00:00:: in 
your dominions." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this for you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the lady. 
 
"Because you are|be%2:42:03:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: and powerful, and no one|one%1:23:00:: else can help|help%2:41:00:: me," 
answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:40:05:: favors|favor%1:04:00:: without some return," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "but this much|much%3:00:00:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will promise. If you will kill|kill%2:35:00:: for me the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:01:: I|i%1:27:00:: 
will bestow|bestow%2:40:00:: upon you a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: brains, and such|such%3:00:00:much:00 good|good%3:00:01:: brains|brain%1:09:00:: that 
you will be|be%2:42:03:: the wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: you asked|ask%2:32:01:: Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," said, the Scarecrow, 
in surprise. 
 
 
 
"So I did. I don't care|care%1:12:01:: who kills|kill%2:35:00:: her. But until she is|be%2:42:03:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: I will 
not|not%4:02:00:: grant|grant%2:32:00:: your wish. Now|now%1:28:00:: go, and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: seek|seek%2:35:00:: me again|again%4:02:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: 
earned|earn%2:40:03:: the brains|brain%1:09:00:: you so|so%4:02:02:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: desire." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: and told|tell%2:32:01:: them what 
Oz had|have%2:42:00:: said; and Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: that the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Head, as she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: him, but a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. 
 
"All the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "she needs|need%2:34:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: as the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman." 
 
On the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and said, 
 
"Oz has|have%2:40:00:: sent|send%2:38:01:: for you. Follow|follow%2:38:00:: me," 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: followed|follow%2:38:00:: him and came|come%2:38:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. He 
did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:02:: whether he would find|find%2:31:10:: Oz a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: or a Head, but 
he hoped|hop%2:38:03:: it would be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady. "For," he said|say%2:32:00:: to himself, "if 
it is|be%2:42:06:: the Head, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:03:: a heart, since a head|head%1:08:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: of its own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 and therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: cannot feel|feel%1:26:00:: for me. But if it 
is|be%2:42:03:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 lady|lady%1:18:02:: I shall beg|beg%2:32:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: for a heart, for all ladies|lady%1:18:02:: are|be%2:42:03:: 
themselves said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: hearted." 
 
But when the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he saw|saw%2:35:00:: neither 
the Head|head%1:08:00:: nor the Lady, for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:30:01:: the shape|shape%1:09:00:: of a most|most%4:02:01:: terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 
Beast. It was|be%2:42:03:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as an elephant, and the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
seemed|seem%2:39:00:: hardly|hardly%4:02:00:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: enough|enough%4:02:00:: to hold|hold%2:35:01:: its weight. The Beast|beast%1:03:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a head|head%1:08:00:: 
like that of a rhinoceros, only|only%4:02:06:: there were|be%2:42:04:: five eyes|eye%1:08:00:: in its face. 
There were|be%2:42:04:: five long|long%3:00:01:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: growing|grow%2:30:02:: out of its body|body%1:08:01:: and it also|also%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
five long, slim|slim%3:00:00:thin:03 legs. Thick, woolly|woolly%3:00:00:soft:01 hair|hair%1:08:00:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: every part|part%1:24:00:: of it, 
and a more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 looking|look%2:39:01:: monster|monster%1:18:02:: could not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: imagined. It was|be%2:42:03:: 
fortunate|fortunate%3:00:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: no heart|heart%1:09:00:: at that moment, for it would 
have|have%2:42:00:: beat|beat%2:38:00:: loud|loud%4:02:00:: and fast|fast%4:02:01:: from terror. But being|be%2:42:03:: only|only%3:00:00:single:05 tin, the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: at all afraid, although he was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: disappointed. 
 
"I am Oz, the Great|great%3:00:01:large:00 and Terrible," spake the Beast, in a voice|voice%1:07:00:: that 
was|be%2:42:03:: one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar. "Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Woodman, and made|make%2:42:05:: of tin. Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: no heart, and cannot 
love. I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that I may be|be%2:42:06:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"Why should I do|do%2:41:01:: this?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: the Beast. 
 
"Because I ask|ask%2:32:01:: it, and you alone|alone%4:02:00:: can grant|grant%2:40:03:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman. 
 
Oz gave|give%2:41:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 growl|growl%1:11:00:: at this, but said, gruffly, 
 
"If you indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: desire|desire%2:37:00:: a heart, you must earn|earn%2:40:03:: it." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
"Help Dorothy to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Beast. "When the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, come|come%2:30:03:: to me, and I will then|then%4:02:00:: give|give%2:40:00:: you 
the biggest|big%3:00:01:: and kindest|kind%3:00:00:: and most|most%4:02:00:: loving|loving%3:00:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: in all the Land|land%1:14:01:: of Oz." 
 
So the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: forced|force%2:41:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: sorrowfully|sorrowfully%4:02:00:: to his friends|friend%1:18:00:: 
and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them of the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: seen. They all wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: at the many|many%3:00:00:: forms|form%1:09:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: could take|take%2:30:01:: upon himself, 
and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: said, 
 
 
 
"If he is|be%2:42:03:: a beast|beast%1:03:00:: when I go|go%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: him, I shall roar|roar%1:10:00:: my loudest, and 
so|so%4:02:05:: frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: him that he will grant|grant%2:32:00:: all I|i%1:23:00:: ask. And if he is|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 
lady, I shall pretend|pretend%2:32:01:: to spring|spring%2:38:01:: upon her, and so|so%4:02:05:: compel|compel%2:41:00:: her to do|do%2:36:01:: my 
bidding. And if he is|be%2:42:03:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Head, he will be|be%2:42:03:: at my mercy; for I 
will roll|roll%2:38:00:: this head|head%1:08:00:: all about the room|room%1:06:00:: until he promises|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:00:: us 
what we desire. So|so%4:02:05:: be|be%2:42:03:: of good|good%3:00:01:: cheer|cheer%1:07:00:: my friends|friend%1:18:00:: for all will yet|yet%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: 
well." 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: to 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and bade|bid%2:32:00:: him enter|enter%2:38:00:: the presence|presence%1:15:00:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the door, and glancing|glance%2:39:00:: around saw, to 
his surprise, that before the throne|throne%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 
and glowing|glowing%3:00:00:enthusiastic:00 he could scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: to gaze|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it. His first|first%3:00:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: that Oz had|have%2:42:00:: by accident|accident%1:11:00:: caught|catch%2:30:00:: on fire|fire%1:22:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: burning|burn%2:30:01:: up; but, 
when he tried|try%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: nearer, the heat|heat%1:07:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: intense|intense%3:00:00:: that it singed|sing%2:32:08:: 
his whiskers, and he crept|creep%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: tremblingly to a spot|spot%1:15:01:: nearer the door. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: a low, quiet|quiet%3:00:00:soft:04 voice|voice%1:07:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: from the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire, and these were|be%2:42:06:: 
the words|word%1:10:00:: it spoke: 
 
 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Who are|be%2:42:06:: you, and why do|do%2:41:01:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: 
me?" And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: answered, 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: a Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of everything. I come|come%2:38:00:: to you to beg|beg%2:32:00:: 
that you give|give%2:40:03:: me courage, so that in reality|reality%1:26:01:: I may become|become%2:42:01:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of 
Beasts, as men|man%1:18:00:: call|call%2:32:02:: me." 
 
"Why should I give|give%2:40:03:: you courage?" demanded|demand%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Because of all Wizards|wizard%1:18:00:: you are|be%2:42:06:: the greatest, and alone|alone%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: power|power%1:07:00:: to 
grant|grant%2:32:00:: my request," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
The Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: burned|burn%2:43:01:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: for a time, and the voice|voice%1:07:00:: said, 
 
"Bring me proof|proof%1:09:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: dead, and that moment|moment%1:28:00:: I will 
give|give%2:40:03:: you courage. But so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: lives|live%2:42:04:: you must remain|remain%2:30:00:: a 
coward." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: at this speech, but could say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: in reply, 
and while he stood|stand%2:35:00:: silently|silently%4:02:00:: gazing|gaze%2:39:00:: at the Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire|fire%1:22:00:: it became|become%2:42:01:: 
so|so%4:02:09:: furiously|furiously%4:02:01:: hot|hot%3:00:01:: that he turned|turn%2:38:00:: tail|tail%1:08:01:: and rushed|rush%2:38:01:: from the room. He 
was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:39:01:: his friends|friend%1:18:00:: waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for him, and told|tell%2:32:01:: them of his 
terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 interview|interview%1:10:01:: with the Wizard. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, sadly. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:01:: one thing|thing%1:04:00:: we can do," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion, "and that 
is|be%2:42:03:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the land|land%1:15:02:: of the Winkies, seek|seek%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, and 
destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: her." 
 
"But suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we cannot?" said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Then I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: courage," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: a heart," spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I shall never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, 
beginning|begin%2:30:00:: to cry. 
 
"Be careful!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, "the tears|tear%1:08:01:: will fall|fall%2:38:03:: on your 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: gown, and spot|spot%1:10:01:: it." 
 
So Dorothy dried|dry%2:30:01:: her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and said, 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we must try|try%2:41:01:: it; but I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I do|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: want|want%2:37:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
anybody, even|even%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:41:12:: Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again." 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: with you; but I'm too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a coward|coward%1:18:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: the Witch," 
said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I will go|go%2:38:00:: too," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow; "but I shall not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: of much|much%3:00:00:: 
help|help%1:04:00:: to you, I am|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a fool." 
 
"I haven't the heart|heart%1:09:00:: to harm|harm%2:29:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: a Witch," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; 
"but if you go|go%2:38:01:: I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall go|go%2:38:00:: with you." 
 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to start|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
morning, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: sharpened|sharpen%2:35:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: on a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grindstone|grindstone%1:06:00:: and 
had|have%2:30:00:: all his joints|joint%1:08:00:: properly|properly%4:02:00:: oiled. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: himself with 
fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: straw|straw%1:27:00:: and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: new|new%3:00:00:: paint|paint%1:06:00:: on his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: that he might see|see%2:39:00:: 
better. The green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind|kind%3:00:00:: to them, filled|fill%2:30:01:: Dorothy's 
basket|basket%1:06:00:: with good|good%3:00:01:: things|thing%1:06:01:: to eat, and fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: a little|little%3:00:01:: bell|bell%1:06:00:: around 
Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: with a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 ribbon. 
 
They went|go%2:38:00:: to bed|bed%1:06:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: early|early%3:00:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: until daylight, when 
they were|be%2:42:03:: awakened|awaken%2:29:00:: by the crowing|crowing%1:10:00:: of a green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 cock|cock%1:05:01:: that lived|live%2:42:08:: in the 
back|back%4:02:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: of the palace, and the cackling of a hen|hen%1:05:01:: that had|have%2:40:00:: laid|lay%2:35:02:: a 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 egg.

Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XII. 
 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: led|lead%2:38:01:: them through the streets|street%1:06:00:: of 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: until they reached|reach%2:38:01:: the room|room%1:06:00:: where the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the 
Gates|gate%1:06:00:: lived. This officer|officer%1:18:03:: unlocked|unlock%2:35:00:: their spectacles|spectacle%1:10:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: them back|back%4:02:04:: in 
his great|great%3:00:01:large:00 box, and then|then%4:02:00:: he politely|politely%4:02:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: for our friends. 
 
"Which road|road%1:06:00:: leads|lead%2:38:01:: to the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"There is|be%2:42:00:: no road," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates; "no one ever|ever%4:02:04:: 
wishes|wish%1:12:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: that way." 
 
"How, then, are|be%2:42:06:: we to find|find%2:40:00:: her?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
 
 
"That will be|be%2:42:03:: easy," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the man; "for when she knows|know%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: in 
the Country|country%1:15:00:: of the Winkies she will find|find%2:40:00:: you, and make|make%2:30:00:: you all her 
slaves." 
 
"Perhaps not," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for we mean|mean%2:31:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: her." 
 
 
 
"Oh, that is|be%2:42:03:: different," said|say%2:32:00:: the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gates. "No one has|have%2:42:00:: 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:35:00:: her before, so I naturally|naturally%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would make|make%2:41:00:: 
slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of you, as she has|have%2:40:00:: of all the rest. But take|take%2:41:04:: care; for she is|be%2:42:03:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: and fierce, and may not|not%4:02:00:: allow|allow%2:41:00:: you to destroy|destroy%2:33:00:: her. Keep|keep%2:42:00:: to the 
West, where the sun|sun%1:17:00:: sets, and you cannot fail|fail%2:41:02:: to find|find%2:40:00:: her." 
 
They thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him and bade|bid%2:32:01:: him good-bye, and turned|turn%2:38:00:: toward the West, 
walking|walk%2:38:00:: over fields|field%1:15:00:: of soft|soft%3:00:01:: grass|grass%1:20:00:: dotted|dot%2:42:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: and there|there%4:02:00:: with daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: 
and buttercups. Dorothy still|still%4:02:01:: wore|wear%2:29:00:: the pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: dress|dress%1:06:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
put|put%2:35:05:: on|on%4:02:00:: in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found|find%2:40:02:: it was|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:01:: green, but pure|pure%3:00:04:: white. The ribbon|ribbon%1:06:00:: around Toto's neck|neck%1:08:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: its green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 color|color%1:07:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: white|white%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's dress. 
 
The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: far|far%4:02:00:: behind. As they advanced|advance%2:38:00:: the 
ground|ground%1:27:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: rougher|rough%3:00:00:: and hillier, for there were|be%2:42:00:: no farms|farm%1:06:00:: nor houses|house%1:06:00:: 
in this country|country%1:15:00:: of the West, and the ground|ground%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: untilled. 
 
In the afternoon|afternoon%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone hot|hot%3:00:01:: in their faces, for there were|be%2:42:04:: no 
trees|tree%1:20:00:: to offer|offer%2:40:02:: them shade; so|so%4:02:06:: that before night|night%1:28:00:: Dorothy and Toto and 
the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: tired, and lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep, 
with the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: keeping|keep%2:31:00:: watch. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: but one eye, yet|yet%4:02:02:: that was|be%2:42:03:: as 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: as a telescope, and could see|see%2:39:00:: everywhere. So, as she sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle, she happened|happen%2:30:02:: to look|look%2:39:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy 
lying|lie%2:42:03:: asleep, with her friends|friend%1:18:00:: all about her. They were|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:01:: 
distance|distance%1:12:00:: off, but the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: them in her 
country; so she blew|blow%2:39:05:: upon a silver|silver%1:27:00:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: that hung around her neck. 
 
At once|once%4:02:02:: there came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: to her from all directions|direction%1:15:00:: a pack|pack%1:14:00:: of great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
wolves. They had|have%2:40:00:: long|long%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: and fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 teeth. 
 
"Go to those people," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, "and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to pieces." 
 
"Are you not|not%4:02:00:: going|go%2:41:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: them your slaves?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the 
wolves. 
 
"No," she answered, "one is|be%2:42:03:: of tin, and one of straw; one is|be%2:42:06:: a girl|girl%1:18:00:: 
and another a Lion. None|none%1:28:00:: of them is|be%2:42:03:: fit|fit%3:00:02:: to work, so you may tear|tear%2:35:01:: them 
into small|small%3:00:00:: pieces." 
 
"Very well," said|say%2:32:00:: the wolf, and he dashed|dash%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 speed, 
followed|follow%2:38:00:: by the others. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: wide|wide%3:00:00:: awake and heard|hear%2:31:00:: 
the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: coming. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my fight," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman; "so get|get%2:30:00:: behind me and I will 
meet|meet%2:38:01:: them as they come." 
 
He seized|seize%2:35:00:: his axe, which he had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sharp, and as the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
of the wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: on the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: swung|swing%2:38:02:: his arm|arm%1:08:00:: and chopped|chop%2:35:03:: the 
wolf's head|head%2:42:04:: from its body, so that it immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: died. As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he 
could raise|raise%2:38:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: another wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: up, and he also|also%4:02:00:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: under the 
sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's weapon. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty wolves, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: a wolf|wolf%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: killed; so that at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: in a 
heap|heap%1:23:00:: before the Woodman. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he put|put%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and sat|sit%2:38:00:: beside the Scarecrow, who said, 
 
"It was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: fight, friend." 
 
They waited|wait%2:42:00:: until Dorothy awoke|awake%2:29:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pile|pile%1:14:00:: of shaggy wolves, but 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: told|tell%2:32:01:: her all. She thanked|thank%2:32:00:: him for saving|save%2:41:01:: them and sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to breakfast, after which they started|start%2:30:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: upon their journey. 
 
 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: this same|same%3:00:02:: morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: came|come%2:38:04:: to the door|door%1:06:00:: of her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
and looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: with her one eye|eye%1:08:00:: that could see|see%2:39:00:: afar off. She saw|saw%2:35:00:: all 
her wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: dead, and the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: still|still%4:02:01:: travelling|travel%2:38:00:: through her 
country. This made|make%2:30:00:: her angrier|angry%3:00:00:stormy:00 than before, and she blew|blow%2:29:00:: her silver|silver%1:07:00:: 
whistle|whistle%2:32:00:: twice. 
 
Straightway a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: of wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: toward her, 
enough|enough%4:02:00:: to darken|darken%2:30:01:: the sky. And the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: to the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow, 
 
"Fly at once|once%4:02:00:: to the strangers; peck|peck%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and tear|tear%2:35:00:: them to 
pieces." 
 
The wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in one great|great%3:00:01:large:00 flock|flock%1:14:00:: toward Dorothy and her 
companions. When the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: afraid. But 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: my battle; so lie|lie%1:10:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: beside me and you will not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: harmed." 
 
So they all lay|lay%2:35:00:: upon the ground|ground%1:17:00:: except the Scarecrow, and he stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
up|up%4:02:00:: and stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his arms. And when the crows|crow%1:05:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: him they were|be%2:42:03:: 
frightened, as these birds|bird%1:05:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: by scarecrows, and did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:01:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: any nearer. But the King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: said, 
 
"It is|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: a stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: man. I will peck|peck%2:35:01:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: out." 
 
The King|king%1:18:00:: Crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at the Scarecrow, who caught|catch%2:35:06:: it by the head|head%1:08:00:: and 
twisted|twist%2:35:02:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: until it died. And then|then%4:02:00:: another crow|crow%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him, 
and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: its neck|neck%1:08:00:: also. There were|be%2:42:04:: forty crows, and 
forty times|time%1:11:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: twisted|twist%2:38:01:: a neck, until at last|last%3:00:00:ultimate:00 all were|be%2:42:03:: 
lying|lie%2:35:00:: dead|dead%3:00:01:: beside him. Then|then%4:02:00:: he called|call%2:32:09:: to his companions|companion%1:18:00:: to rise, and 
again|again%4:02:00:: they went|go%2:30:01:: upon their journey. 
 
When the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: looked|look%2:39:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: all her crows|crow%1:05:00:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in 
a heap, she got|get%2:30:00:: into a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 rage, and blew|blow%2:29:00:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon her 
silver|silver%3:00:00:bright:00 whistle. 
 
 
 
Forthwith there|there%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 buzzing|buzz%2:42:00:: in the air, and a swarm|swarm%1:14:00:: 
of black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: flying|fly%2:38:00:: towards her. "Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and 
sting|sting%2:39:00:: them to death!" commanded|command%2:32:00:: the Witch, and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: 
walking. But the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming|come%2:38:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
decided|decide%2:31:00:: what to do. 
 
"Take out|out%4:02:04:: my straw|straw%1:27:00:: and scatter|scatter%2:35:00:: it over the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: and the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
and the lion," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Woodman, "and the bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot sting|sting%1:26:01:: 
them." This the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: did, and as Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: beside the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and held|hold%2:35:00:: Toto in her arms, the straw|straw%1:27:00:: covered|cover%2:35:01:: them entirely. 
 
The bees|bee%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: and found|find%2:40:02:: no one|one%1:23:00:: but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: to sting, so they 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: at him and broke|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: all their stings|sting%1:26:00:: against the tin, without 
hurting|hurt%2:39:01:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: at all. And as bees|bee%1:05:00:: cannot live|live%4:02:00:: when their stings|sting%1:26:01:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: broken|break%2:30:00:: that was|be%2:42:06:: the end|end%1:28:00:: of the black|black%3:00:01:: bees, and they lay|lay%2:35:00:: scattered|scatter%2:30:00:: 
thick|thick%3:00:00:impenetrable:00 about the Woodman, like little|little%3:00:01:: heaps|heap%1:23:00:: of fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: up, and the girl|girl%1:18:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: 
put|put%2:35:00:: the straw|straw%1:27:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: again, until he was|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as 
ever. So they started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey|journey%1:04:00:: once more. 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: her black|black%3:00:01:: bees|bee%1:05:00:: in little|little%3:00:00:young:00 
heaps|heap%1:14:00:: like fine|fine%3:00:00:thin:01 coal|coal%1:27:00:: that she stamped|stamp%2:38:00:: her foot|foot%1:08:01:: and tore|tear%2:35:00:: her hair|hair%1:08:00:: and 
gnashed|gnash%2:29:00:: her teeth. And then|then%4:02:00:: she called|call%2:32:05:: a dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of her slaves, who 
were|be%2:42:06:: the Winkies, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 spears, telling|tell%2:32:02:: them to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:01:: them. 
 
The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: people, but they had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as they were|be%2:42:03:: 
told; so they marched|march%2:38:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: near to Dorothy. Then|then%4:02:00:: the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:32:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 roar|roar%1:10:00:: and sprang|spring%2:38:01:: toward them, and the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Winkies 
were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 that they ran|run%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as they could. 
 
When they returned|return%2:38:00:: to the castle|castle%1:06:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: beat|beat%2:33:00:: them well|well%4:02:03:: 
with a strap, and sent|send%2:38:01:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to their work, after which she sat|sit%2:38:01:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: what she should do|do%2:41:01:: next. She could not|not%4:02:00:: understand|understand%2:31:00:: how 
all her plans|plan%1:09:00:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: these strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: failed; but she was|be%2:42:03:: a 
powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: Witch, as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 one, and she soon|soon%4:02:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her 
mind|mind%2:31:02:: how to act. 
 
 
 
There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle|circle%1:25:00:: of diamonds|diamond%1:21:00:: and 
rubies|ruby%1:27:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: round|round%3:00:00:: it. This Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: a charm. Whoever owned|own%2:40:00:: 
it could call|call%2:32:05:: three times|time%1:11:00:: upon the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, who would obey|obey%2:41:00:: 
any order|order%1:10:03:: they were|be%2:42:03:: given. But no person|person%1:03:00:: could command|command%2:32:01:: these strange|strange%3:00:00:: 
creatures|creature%1:03:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than three times. Twice|twice%4:02:00:: already|already%4:02:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: 
used|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Cap. Once|once%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: the Winkies her 
slaves, and set|set%2:30:01:: herself to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over|over%4:02:02:: their country. The Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her do|do%2:41:01:: this. The second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: when she had|have%2:40:00:: fought|fight%2:33:01:: against 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz himself, and driven|drive%2:35:11:: him out of the land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. The 
Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: helped|help%2:41:00:: her in doing|do%2:41:01:: this. Only|only%4:02:01:: once|once%4:02:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: could 
she use|use%2:34:01:: this Golden Cap, for which reason|reason%1:16:00:: she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: to do|do%2:36:01:: so|so%4:02:05:: 
until all her other|other%3:00:00:: powers|power%1:09:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: exhausted. But now|now%4:02:05:: that her fierce|fierce%3:00:00:stormy:00 
wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: and her wild|wild%3:00:01:: crows|crow%1:05:00:: and her stinging|stinging%3:00:00:unkind:00 bees|bee%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: gone, and her 
slaves|slave%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: scared|scar%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: by the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, she saw|saw%2:35:00:: there was|be%2:42:03:: 
only|only%4:02:01:: one way|way%1:04:01:: left|leave%2:31:05:: to destroy|destroy%2:36:00:: Dorothy and her friends. 
 
 
 
So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: took|take%2:30:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: from her cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and placed|place%2:35:00:: 
it upon her head. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her left|leave%2:38:01:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, slowly, "Ep-pe, pep-pe, 
kak-ke!" 
 
Next|next%4:02:00:: she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon her right|right%3:00:00:: foot|foot%1:08:01:: and said, "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" 
 
After this she stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon both feet|foot%1:08:01:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice, 
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to work. The sky|sky%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: darkened, and a low|low%3:00:01:: 
rumbling|rumble%2:39:00:: sound|sound%1:11:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: heard|hear%2:39:00:: in the air. There was|be%2:42:04:: a rushing|rush%2:30:00:: of many|many%3:00:00:: 
wings; a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and laughing; and the sun|sun%1:17:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: out of the 
dark|dark%3:00:02:: sky|sky%1:17:00:: to show|show%2:39:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: surrounded|surround%2:35:00:: by a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: of monkeys, 
each with a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of immense|immense%3:00:01:large:00 and powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: wings|wing%1:05:00:: on his shoulders. 
 
One, much|much%4:02:00:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: than the others, seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: their leader. He flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
close|close%4:02:01:: to the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and said, 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:05:: us for the third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 and last|last%3:00:00:: time. What do|do%2:41:01:: you command?" 
 
"Go to the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: who are|be%2:42:05:: within my land|land%1:15:01:: and destroy|destroy%2:35:00:: them all 
except the Lion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch. "Bring that beast|beast%1:03:00:: to me, for 
I have|have%2:40:00:: a mind|mind%1:09:00:: to harness|harness%1:06:00:: him like a horse, and make|make%2:32:00:: him work." 
 
"Your commands|command%1:10:00:: shall be|be%2:42:03:: obeyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the leader; and then, with a 
great|great%3:00:01:large:00 deal|deal%1:23:00:: of chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and noise, the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to 
the place|place%1:15:00:: where Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: walking. 
 
 
 
Some of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: until they were|be%2:42:03:: over a country|country%1:15:02:: thickly|thickly%4:02:01:: covered|cover%2:42:01:: with sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 
rocks. Here|here%4:02:00:: they dropped|drop%2:38:01:: the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 Woodman, who fell|fall%2:38:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
to the rocks, where he lay|lay%2:35:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: battered|batter%2:35:01:: and dented|dent%2:35:00:: that he could 
neither move|move%1:04:03:: nor groan. 
 
Others of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow, and with their long|long%3:00:01:: 
fingers|finger%1:23:01:: pulled|pull%2:35:00:: all of the straw|straw%1:27:00:: out of his clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: and head. They 
made|make%2:30:15:: his hat|hat%1:06:00:: and boots|boot%1:06:00:: and clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: into a small|small%3:00:00:: bundle|bundle%1:06:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:07:: it 
into the top|top%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: of a tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree. 
 
The remaining|remain%2:42:03:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: threw|throw%2:35:00:: pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of stout|stout%1:13:00:: rope|rope%1:06:00:: around the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
and wound|wind%2:35:06:: many|many%3:00:00:: coils|coil%1:25:00:: about his body|body%1:08:01:: and head|head%1:08:00:: and legs, until he was|be%2:42:03:: 
unable|unable%3:00:00:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: or scratch|scratch%2:35:00:: or struggle|struggle%2:35:00:: in any way. Then|then%4:02:00:: they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: 
him up|up%4:02:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: with him to the Witch's castle, where he was|be%2:42:03:: 
placed|place%2:40:00:: in a small|small%3:00:00:: yard|yard%1:06:02:: with a high|high%3:00:02:: iron|iron%1:27:00:: fence|fence%1:06:00:: around it, so that he 
could not|not%4:02:00:: escape. 
 
But Dorothy they did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: at all. She stood, with Toto in her 
arms, watching|watch%2:39:02:: the sad|sad%3:00:00:: fate|fate%1:11:00:: of her comrades|comrade%1:18:00:: and thinking|think%2:31:03:: it would 
soon|soon%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:06:: her turn. The leader|leader%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her, 
his long, hairy|hairy%3:00:00:: arms|arm%1:08:00:: stretched|stretch%2:29:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and his ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: face|face%1:08:00:: grinning|grin%2:29:00:: 
terribly; but he saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: of the Good|good%1:07:00:: Witch's kiss|kiss%1:04:00:: upon her 
forehead|forehead%1:08:00:: and stopped|stop%2:38:00:: short, motioning|motion%2:32:00:: the others not|not%4:02:00:: to touch|touch%2:35:00:: her. 
 
 
 
"We dare not|not%4:02:00:: harm|harm%2:29:00:: this little|little%3:00:01:: girl," he said|say%2:32:00:: to them, "for she is|be%2:42:06:: 
protected|protect%2:33:00:: by the Power|power%1:07:00:: of Good, and that is|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:large:00 than the Power|power%1:07:00:: 
of Evil. All we can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: her to the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch|witch%1:18:03:: and leave|leave%2:31:05:: her there." 
 
So, carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and gently, they lifted|lift%2:38:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: her swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: through the air|air%1:15:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the castle, 
where they set|set%2:35:00:: her down|down%4:02:00:: upon the front|front%3:00:00:: door|door%1:06:01:: step. Then|then%4:02:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: 
said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: obeyed|obey%2:41:00:: you as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as we were|be%2:42:03:: able. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: destroyed, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in your yard. The 
little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: we dare|dare%2:41:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: harm, nor the dog|dog%1:05:00:: she carries|carry%2:35:02:: in her arms. Your 
power|power%1:07:00:: over our band|band%1:14:01:: is|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: ended, and you will never|never%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: us again." 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: all the Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys, with much|much%3:00:00:: laughing and chattering|chattering%1:11:01:: and 
noise, flew|fly%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: out of sight. 
 
 
 
The Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: both surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: and worried|worry%2:37:00:: when she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the mark|mark%1:10:02:: 
on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: well|well%4:02:00:: that neither the Winged 
Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: nor she, herself, dare hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: in any way. She looked|look%2:39:00:: 
down|down%4:02:00:: at Dorothy's feet, and seeing|see%2:39:00:: the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes, began|begin%2:30:00:: to tremble|tremble%2:38:00:: 
with fear, for she knew|know%2:31:01:: what a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: charm|charm%1:06:00:: belonged|belong%2:40:00:: to them. At 
first|first%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: tempted|tempt%2:32:01:: to run|run%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from Dorothy; but she happened|happen%2:30:02:: 
to look|look%2:39:00:: into the child's eyes|eye%1:08:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: how simple|simple%3:00:02:: the soul|soul%1:18:00:: behind them 
was, and that the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: of the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: gave|give%2:40:03:: her. So the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: to herself, and 
thought, "I can still|still%4:02:01:: make|make%2:30:00:: her my slave, for she does|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:03:: how to 
use|use%2:34:01:: her power." Then|then%4:02:00:: she said|say%2:32:00:: to Dorothy, harshly|harshly%4:02:02:: and severely, 
 
"Come with me; and see|see%2:31:03:: that you mind|mind%2:31:02:: everything I tell|tell%2:32:04:: you, for if 
you do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: I will make|make%2:30:00:: an end|end%1:28:00:: of you, as I did|do%2:41:01:: of the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and 
the Scarecrow." 
 
Dorothy followed|follow%2:38:00:: her through many|many%3:00:00:: of the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: in her castle|castle%1:06:02:: 
until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the kitchen, where the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: bade|bid%2:32:00:: her clean|clean%2:35:00:: the pots|pot%1:06:00:: 
and kettles|kettle%1:06:00:: and sweep|sweep%1:18:00:: the floor|floor%1:06:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the fire|fire%1:22:00:: fed|fed%1:18:00:: with wood. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:41:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: meekly, with her mind|mind%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: as 
she could; for she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to kill|kill%2:35:00:: 
her. 
 
With Dorothy hard|hard%4:02:00:: at work|work%1:04:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: thought|think%2:31:03:: she would go|go%2:41:00:: into the 
court-yard and harness|harness%1:06:00:: the Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: like a horse; it would amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: 
her, she was|be%2:42:03:: sure, to make|make%2:32:00:: him draw|draw%2:35:03:: her chariot|chariot%1:06:00:: whenever she wished|wish%2:37:02:: 
to go|go%2:38:00:: to drive. But as she opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar|roar%1:11:01:: 
and bounded|bound%2:38:01:: at her so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and shut|shut%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: again. 
 
"If I cannot harness|harness%1:06:00:: you," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: to the Lion, speaking|speaking%1:10:01:: 
through the bars|bar%1:06:00:: of the gate, "I can starve|starve%2:34:03:: you. You shall have|have%2:40:00:: 
nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to eat|eat%2:34:00:: until you do|do%2:41:01:: as I wish." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: after that she took|take%2:38:10:: no food|food%1:03:00:: to the imprisoned|imprison%2:41:00:: Lion; but every day|day%1:28:00:: 
she came|come%2:38:04:: to the gate|gate%1:06:00:: at noon|noon%1:28:00:: and asked, 
 
"Are you ready|ready%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: harnessed|harness%2:35:00:: like a horse?" 
 
And the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: would answer, 
 
"No. If you come|come%2:38:00:: in this yard|yard%1:06:02:: I will bite|bite%2:35:00:: you." 
 
The reason|reason%1:10:01:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: wished|wish%2:37:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
every night, while the woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: asleep|asleep%3:00:00:: Dorothy carried|carry%2:35:02:: him food|food%1:03:00:: from 
the cupboard. After he had|have%2:34:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: he would lie|lie%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on his bed|bed%1:06:00:: of straw, 
and Dorothy would lie|lie%2:35:00:: beside him and put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: on his soft, shaggy 
mane, while they talked|talk%2:32:01:: of their troubles|trouble%1:09:00:: and tried|try%2:41:00:: to plan|plan%2:31:00:: some way|way%1:04:01:: to 
escape. But they could find|find%2:36:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:00:: out of the castle, for it was|be%2:42:06:: 
constantly|constantly%4:02:01:: guarded|guard%2:41:00:: by the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, who were|be%2:42:03:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and too|too%4:02:00:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her not|not%4:02:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as she told|tell%2:32:02:: them. 
 
The girl|girl%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:01:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during the day, and often|often%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
threatened|threaten%2:32:00:: to beat|beat%2:35:01:: her with the same|same%3:00:02:: old|old%3:00:01:: umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: she always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: in 
her hand. But, in truth, she did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: to strike|strike%2:35:00:: Dorothy, because of 
the mark|mark%1:10:02:: upon her forehead. The child|child%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: this, and was|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: 
of fear|fear%1:12:00:: for herself and Toto. Once|once%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: struck|strike%2:35:00:: Toto a blow|blow%1:04:01:: with 
her umbrella|umbrella%1:06:00:: and the brave|brave%2:42:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: at her and bit|bite%2:35:00:: her leg, in 
return. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: did|do%2:36:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: bleed|bleed%2:29:00:: where she was|be%2:42:03:: bitten, for she was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: that the blood|blood%1:08:00:: in her had|have%2:40:00:: dried|dry%2:30:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: before. 
 
Dorothy's life|life%1:26:02:: became|become%2:30:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: as she grew|grow%2:30:03:: to understand|understand%2:31:01:: that it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: harder|hard%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: and Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em again. 
Sometimes|sometimes%4:02:01:: she would cry|cry%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: for hours, with Toto sitting|sit%2:42:00:: at her 
feet|foot%1:08:01:: and looking|look%2:39:00:: into her face, whining|whine%2:32:00:: dismally|dismally%4:02:01:: to show|show%2:39:00:: how sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: he 
was|be%2:42:06:: for his little|little%3:00:01:: mistress. Toto did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: care|care%2:37:02:: whether he was|be%2:42:03:: 
in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: or the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: as Dorothy was|be%2:42:05:: with him; but he 
knew|know%2:31:01:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: unhappy, and that made|make%2:30:00:: him unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: too. 
 
Now|now%4:02:05:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: had|have%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 longing|longing%1:12:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: for her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 the 
Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: which the girl|girl%1:18:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: wore. Her Bees|bee%1:05:00:: and her Crows|crow%1:05:00:: and 
her Wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in heaps|heap%1:14:00:: and drying|dry%2:30:00:: up, and she had|have%2:40:01:: used|use%2:34:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
all the power|power%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap; but if she could only|only%4:02:02:: get|get%2:40:00:: hold|hold%1:04:00:: of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: they would give|give%2:40:03:: her more|more%3:00:01:: power|power%1:07:00:: than all the other|other%3:00:00:: 
things|thing%1:09:02:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost. She watched|watch%2:41:00:: Dorothy carefully, to see|see%2:32:00:: if she 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:04:: her shoes, thinking|think%2:31:03:: she might steal|steal%2:40:00:: them. But the child|child%1:18:01:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: that she never|never%4:02:00:: took|take%2:30:00:: them off|off%4:02:04:: except 
at night|night%1:28:00:: and when she took|take%2:39:00:: her bath. The Witch|witch%1:18:03:: was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: much|much%4:02:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: 
of the dark|dark%1:26:00:: to dare|dare%2:41:00:: go|go%2:38:00:: in Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: at night|night%1:28:00:: to take|take%2:40:01:: the shoes, 
and her dread|dread%1:12:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greater|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 than her fear|fear%1:12:00:: of the dark, so she 
never|never%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: near when Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: bathing. Indeed, the old|old%3:00:02:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: never|never%4:02:01:: 
touched|touch%2:39:00:: water, nor ever|ever%4:02:04:: let|let%2:41:00:: water|water%1:27:00:: touch|touch%2:35:00:: her in any way. 
 
But the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature|creature%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: cunning, and she finally|finally%4:02:02:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of 
a trick|trick%1:04:04:: that would give|give%2:40:03:: her what she wanted. She placed|place%2:35:00:: a bar|bar%1:06:00:: of iron|iron%1:27:00:: 
in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor, and then|then%4:02:00:: by her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 arts|art%1:09:00:: made|make%2:36:12:: 
the iron|iron%1:27:00:: invisible|invisible%3:00:04:: to human|human%3:01:01:: eyes. So that when Dorothy walked|walk%2:38:00:: across 
the floor|floor%1:06:00:: she stumbled|stumble%2:38:00:: over the bar, not|not%4:02:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: it, and 
fell|fall%2:38:00:: at full|full%3:00:01:whole:00 length. She was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: hurt, but in her fall|fall%1:04:01:: one of 
the Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: off, and before she could reach|reach%2:42:00:: it the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
had|have%2:42:00:: snatched|snatch%2:35:00:: it away|away%4:02:01:: and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 skinny|skinny%3:00:00:thin:03 foot. 
 
The wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with the success|success%1:26:00:: of her trick, 
for as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as she had|have%2:40:00:: one of the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: she owned|own%2:40:00:: half the power|power%1:07:00:: of 
their charm, and Dorothy could not|not%4:02:00:: use|use%2:34:01:: it against her, even|even%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: she 
known|know%2:31:01:: how to do|do%2:41:01:: so. 
 
 
 
The little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, seeing|see%2:31:01:: she had|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: one of her pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 shoes, grew|grow%2:30:00:: 
angry, and said|say%2:32:00:: to the Witch, 
 
"Give me back|back%2:38:01:: my shoe!" 
 
"I will not," retorted|retort%2:32:00:: the Witch, "for it is|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: my shoe, and not|not%4:02:00:: 
yours." 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: a wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: creature!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "You have|have%2:40:00:: no right|right%1:07:00:: to 
take|take%2:40:00:: my shoe|shoe%1:06:00:: from me." 
 
"I shall keep|keep%2:40:00:: it, just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Witch, laughing at her, 
"and some day|day%1:28:00:: I shall get|get%2:40:00:: the other|other%3:00:00:: one from you, too." 
 
This made|make%2:30:00:: Dorothy so|so%4:02:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: that she picked|pick%2:40:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of 
water|water%1:27:00:: that stood|stand%2:35:00:: near and dashed|dash%2:35:02:: it over the Witch, wetting|wet%2:30:00:: her from 
head|head%1:08:00:: to foot. 
 
Instantly|instantly%4:02:02:: the wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: woman|woman%1:18:00:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: of fear; and then, as 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at her in wonder, the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to shrink|shrink%2:30:01:: and fall|fall%2:38:00:: 
away. 
 
"See what you have|have%2:40:00:: done!" she screamed. "In a minute|minute%1:28:00:: I shall melt|melt%2:30:01:: 
away." 
 
"I'm very|very%4:02:00:: sorry, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: truly|truly%4:02:00:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 to 
see|see%2:39:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: actually|actually%4:02:00:: melting|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: like brown|brown%3:00:00:chromatic:00 sugar|sugar%1:13:00:: before her very|very%4:02:00:: 
eyes. 
 
"Didn't you know|know%2:31:01:: water|water%1:27:00:: would be|be%2:42:03:: the end|end%1:11:00:: of me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Witch, in a 
wailing, despairing voice. 
 
"Of course|course%1:14:00:: not," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "how should I?" 
 
"Well, in a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: all melted, and you will have|have%2:40:00:: the 
castle|castle%1:06:02:: to yourself. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: in my day, but I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: 
a little|little%3:00:01:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: like you would ever|ever%4:02:04:: be|be%2:42:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to melt|melt%2:30:01:: me and end|end%2:30:01:: my 
wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: deeds. Look|look%1:04:00:: out--here I go!" 
 
With these words|word%1:10:03:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: fell|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in a brown, melted, shapeless|shapeless%3:00:00:unformed:00 
mass|mass%1:17:00:: and began|begin%2:30:00:: to spread|spread%2:38:02:: over the clean|clean%3:00:01:: boards|board%1:27:00:: of the kitchen|kitchen%1:06:00:: floor. 
Seeing|see%2:39:00:: that she had|have%2:40:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: away|away%4:02:00:: to nothing, Dorothy drew|draw%2:38:02:: 
another bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water|water%1:27:00:: and threw|throw%2:35:00:: it over the mess. She then|then%4:02:00:: swept|sweep%2:42:00:: 
it all out|out%4:02:04:: the door. After picking|pick%2:31:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the silver|silver%1:27:00:: shoe, which was|be%2:42:03:: 
all that was|be%2:42:03:: left|leave%2:31:05:: of the old|old%3:00:02:: woman, she cleaned|clean%2:35:00:: and dried|dry%2:30:01:: it with a 
cloth, and put|put%2:35:00:: it on her foot|foot%1:08:01:: again. Then, being|be%2:42:03:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 free|free%3:00:00:: to do|do%2:36:01:: 
as she chose, she ran|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to the court-yard to tell|tell%2:32:04:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: that the 
Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:30:03:: to an end, and that they were|be%2:42:06:: no 
longer|long%3:00:02:: prisoners|prisoner%1:18:00:: in a strange|strange%3:00:01:: land. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIII. 
 
 
The Cowardly Lion|lion%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:03:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: to hear|hear%2:31:00:: that the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: 
had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: melted|melt%2:30:01:: by a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water, and Dorothy at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: 
the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of his prison|prison%1:06:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: him free. They went|go%2:38:00:: in together|together%4:02:00:: to 
the castle, where Dorothy's first|first%4:02:00:: act|act%2:36:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: to call|call%2:32:05:: all the Winkies 
together|together%4:02:01:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: them that they were|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: longer|long%3:00:02:: slaves. 
 
There was|be%2:42:03:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 rejoicing|rejoice%2:37:00:: among the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies, for they had|have%2:40:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:32:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: during many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: for the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch, who 
had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them with great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 cruelty. They kept|keep%2:41:05:: this day|day%1:28:00:: as 
a holiday, then|then%4:02:01:: and ever|ever%4:02:05:: after, and spent|spend%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: in feasting|feast%2:34:00:: and 
dancing. 
 
"If our friends, the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, were|be%2:42:06:: only|only%4:02:02:: with 
us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"Don't you suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: we could rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"We can try," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they called|call%2:32:01:: the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Winkies and asked|ask%2:32:00:: them if they would help|help%2:41:00:: 
to rescue|rescue%2:41:00:: their friends, and the Winkies said|say%2:32:00:: that they would be|be%2:42:03:: 
delighted|delighted%3:00:00:pleased:00 to do|do%2:41:01:: all in their power|power%1:07:02:: for Dorothy, who had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:30:01:: them free|free%3:00:00:: 
from bondage. So she chose|choose%2:31:00:: a number|number%1:07:00:: of the Winkies who looked|look%2:39:01:: as if 
they knew|know%2:31:00:: the most, and they all started|start%2:38:02:: away. They travelled|travel%2:38:00:: that 
day|day%1:28:00:: and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the rocky|rocky%3:00:00:rough:00 plain|plain%1:17:00:: where the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman lay, all battered|batter%2:35:01:: and bent. His axe|axe%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:05:: near him, but the 
blade|blade%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: rusted|rust%2:30:01:: and the handle|handle%2:35:01:: broken|break%2:30:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: short. 
 
The Winkies lifted|lift%2:38:00:: him tenderly|tenderly%4:02:00:: in their arms, and carried|carry%2:35:02:: him back|back%4:02:04:: 
to the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 castle|castle%1:06:02:: again, Dorothy shedding|shed%2:35:02:: a few|few%3:00:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: by the way|way%1:15:00:: 
at the sad|sad%3:00:00:: plight|plight%1:26:00:: of her old|old%3:00:02:: friend, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: looking|look%2:39:01:: sober|sober%3:00:01:: and 
sorry. When they reached|reach%2:38:01:: the castle|castle%1:06:00:: Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: to the Winkies, 
 
"Are any of your people|people%1:14:02:: tinsmiths?" 
 
"Oh, yes; some of us are|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: tinsmiths," they told|tell%2:32:04:: her. 
 
"Then bring|bring%2:35:00:: them to me," she said. And when the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: came, 
bringing|bring%2:38:00:: with them all their tools|tool%1:06:00:: in baskets, she enquired, 
 
[Illustration: "_The Tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four 
nights._"] 
 
"Can you straighten|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: those dents|dent%1:25:00:: in the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, and bend|bend%1:25:01:: 
him back|back%4:02:05:: into shape|shape%1:08:00:: again, and solder|solder%1:27:00:: him together|together%4:02:02:: where he is|be%2:42:05:: 
broken?" 
 
The tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: over carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and then|then%4:02:00:: answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
that they thought|think%2:31:03:: they could mend|mend%2:30:00:: him so he would be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever. 
So|so%4:02:09:: they set|set%2:30:09:: to work|work%2:41:00:: in one of the big|big%3:00:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 rooms|room%1:06:00:: of the castle|castle%1:06:00:: and 
worked|work%2:41:00:: for three days|day%1:28:00:: and four nights, hammering|hammer%2:35:00:: and twisting|twist%2:35:02:: and 
bending|bend%2:35:08:: and soldering and polishing|polish%2:35:00:: and pounding|pound%2:35:00:: at the legs|leg%1:08:01:: and body|body%1:08:00:: 
and head|head%1:08:00:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, until at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: straightened|straighten%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into 
his old|old%3:00:01:: form, and his joints|joint%1:08:00:: worked|work%2:35:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: as ever. To be|be%2:42:03:: sure, there 
were|be%2:42:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 patches|patch%1:07:00:: on him, but the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: a good|good%3:00:01:: job, and as 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a vain|vain%3:00:00:proud:00 man|man%1:18:00:: he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: mind|mind%2:32:00:: the patches|patch%1:06:00:: at all. 
 
When, at last, he walked|walk%2:38:00:: into Dorothy's room|room%1:06:00:: and thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her for 
rescuing|rescue%2:41:00:: him, he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: that he wept|weep%2:29:00:: tears|tear%1:08:01:: of joy, and 
Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: every tear|tear%2:29:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: from his face|face%1:08:00:: with her 
apron, so his joints|joint%1:08:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: rusted. At the same|same%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
tears|tear%1:08:01:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 and fast|fast%3:00:01:: at the joy|joy%1:12:00:: of meeting|meet%2:41:01:: her old|old%3:00:03:past:00 friend|friend%1:18:00:: again, 
and these tears|tear%1:08:01:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: need|need%2:34:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: away. As for the Lion, he 
wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: his eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: with the tip|tip%1:15:00:: of his tail|tail%1:05:00:: that it became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: 
wet, and he was|be%2:42:03:: obliged|oblige%2:41:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: into the court-yard and hold|hold%2:35:00:: it in 
the sun|sun%1:19:00:: till it dried. 
 
"If we only|only%4:02:02:: had|have%2:40:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: with us again," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, 
when Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: telling|tell%2:32:01:: him everything that had|have%2:40:00:: happened, 
"I should be|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy." 
 
"We must try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:00:: him," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: she called|call%2:32:05:: the Winkies to help|help%2:41:00:: her, and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: all that day|day%1:28:00:: 
and part|part%1:06:00:: of the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 until they came|come%2:38:04:: to the tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: in the branches|branch%1:20:00:: 
of which the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: tossed|toss%2:35:04:: the Scarecrow's clothes. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: tall|tall%3:00:00:: tree, and the trunk|trunk%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: smooth|smooth%3:00:00:: that no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could climb|climb%2:38:00:: it; but the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: at once, 
 
"I'll chop|chop%2:35:01:: it down, and then|then%4:02:00:: we can get|get%2:35:03:: the Scarecrow's clothes." 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: while the tinsmiths|tinsmith%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: at work|work%1:04:00:: mending|mend%2:30:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: himself, 
another of the Winkies, who was|be%2:41:00:: a goldsmith, had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:01:: an axe-handle 
of solid|solid%3:00:00:homogeneous:00 gold|gold%1:27:00:: and fitted|fit%2:40:00:: it to the Woodman's axe, instead|instead%4:02:00:: of the 
old|old%3:00:01:: broken|broken%3:00:01:: handle. Others polished|polish%2:35:00:: the blade|blade%1:06:00:: until all the rust|rust%1:22:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
removed|remove%2:30:00:: and it glistened|glisten%2:39:00:: like burnished|burnish%2:35:00:: silver. 
 
As|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: spoken, the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to chop, and in a 
short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:11:00:: the tree|tree%1:20:00:: fell|fall%2:38:15:: over|over%4:02:01:: with a crash, when the Scarecrow's 
clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: out of the branches|branch%1:20:00:: and rolled|roll%2:38:00:: off|off%4:02:03:: on the ground. 
 
Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: them up|up%4:02:00:: and had|have%2:32:00:: the Winkies carry|carry%2:35:02:: them back|back%4:02:04:: to the 
castle, where they were|be%2:42:03:: stuffed|stuff%2:30:12:: with nice, clean|clean%3:00:01:: straw; and, behold! 
here|here%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: the Scarecrow, as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as ever, thanking|thank%2:32:00:: them over and over 
again|again%4:02:00:: for saving|save%2:41:01:: him. 
 
Now|now%4:02:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: reunited, Dorothy and her friends|friend%1:18:00:: spent|spend%2:42:00:: a few|few%3:00:00:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
at the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Castle, where they found|find%2:40:02:: everything they needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:36:00:: 
them comfortable. But one day|day%1:28:03:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: thought|thought%1:09:01:: of Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em, and said, 
 
"We must go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Oz, and claim|claim%2:40:00:: his promise." 
 
"Yes," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, "at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my heart." 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my brains," added|add%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow, joyfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:40:00:: my courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, thoughtfully. 
 
"And I shall get|get%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy, clapping|clap%2:29:00:: her hands. 
"Oh, let|let%2:41:00:: us start|start%2:30:00:: for the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to-morrow!" 
 
 
 
This they decided|decide%2:31:00:: to do. The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 day|day%1:28:00:: they called|call%2:41:00:: the Winkies together|together%4:02:01:: 
and bade|bid%2:32:01:: them good-bye. The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: to have|have%2:30:00:: them go, and 
they had|have%2:40:00:: grown|grow%2:30:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: that they begged|beg%2:32:00:: him to stay|stay%2:42:01:: 
and rule|rule%1:26:00:: over them and the Yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: Land|land%1:15:01:: of the West. Finding|finding%1:04:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: 
determined|determine%2:31:00:: to go, the Winkies gave|give%2:40:00:: Toto and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: each a golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 
collar; and to Dorothy they presented|present%2:40:01:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: bracelet, studded|stud%2:42:00:: 
with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: they gave|give%2:40:00:: a gold-headed walking|walking%1:04:00:: 
stick, to keep|keep%2:41:01:: him from stumbling; and to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: they offered|offer%2:40:02:: 
a silver|silver%1:27:00:: oil-can, inlaid with gold|gold%1:27:00:: and set|set%2:35:02:: with precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 jewels. 
 
Every one of the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: made|make%2:41:00:: the Winkies a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:bad:00 speech|speech%1:10:01:: in 
return, and all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with them until their arms|arm%1:08:00:: ached. 
 
Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: to the Witch's cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: her basket|basket%1:06:00:: with food|food%1:03:00:: for 
the journey, and there she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the Golden Cap. She tried|try%2:41:01:: it on her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 
head|head%1:08:00:: and found|find%2:31:09:: that it fitted|fit%2:30:01:: her exactly. She did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: anything 
about the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap, but she saw|saw%2:35:00:: that it was|be%2:42:03:: pretty, so|so%4:02:09:: 
she made|make%2:36:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: to wear|wear%2:29:00:: it and carry|carry%2:35:02:: her sunbonnet|sunbonnet%1:06:00:: in the basket. 
 
Then, being|be%2:42:03:: prepared|prepare%2:30:00:: for the journey, they all started|start%2:38:02:: for the 
Emerald City; and the Winkies gave|give%2:40:07:: them three cheers|cheer%1:10:00:: and many|many%3:00:00:: good|good%3:00:00:fortunate:00 
wishes|wish%1:09:00:: to carry|carry%2:42:01:: with them. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIV. 
 
 
You will remember|remember%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: no road--not even|even%4:02:00:: a pathway--between 
the castle|castle%1:06:02:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:01:: and the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. When the four 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in search|search%1:04:00:: of the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: she had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: them coming, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: sent|send%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to bring|bring%2:38:00:: them to her. It was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: harder|hard%3:00:06:: 
to find|find%2:36:00:: their way|way%1:15:00:: back|back%4:02:00:: through the big|big%3:00:01:: fields|field%1:15:00:: of buttercups|buttercup%1:20:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 daisies|daisy%1:20:00:: than it was|be%2:42:03:: being|be%2:42:03:: carried. They knew, of course, they 
must go|go%2:38:00:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: east, toward the rising|rise%2:38:08:: sun; and they started|start%2:38:02:: off|off%4:02:03:: 
in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 way. But at noon, when the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: over their heads, 
they did|do%2:38:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: which was|be%2:42:03:: east|east%3:00:00:: and which was|be%2:42:03:: west, and that was|be%2:42:06:: 
the reason|reason%1:16:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: lost|lose%2:39:00:: in the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 fields. They kept|keep%2:42:07:: on walking, 
however, and at night|night%1:28:00:: the moon|moon%1:17:01:: came|come%2:30:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: and shone brightly. So they 
lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: among the sweet|sweet%3:00:00:fragrant:00 smelling|smell%2:39:01:: yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 flowers|flower%1:20:00:: and slept|sleep%2:29:00:: soundly|soundly%4:02:01:: 
until morning--all but the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the sun|sun%1:17:00:: was|be%2:42:04:: behind a cloud, but they started|start%2:30:00:: on, as 
if they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: which way|way%1:15:00:: they were|be%2:42:03:: going. 
 
"If we walk|walk%2:38:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: enough," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "we shall sometime|sometime%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to 
some place, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure." 
 
But day|day%1:28:00:: by day|day%1:28:00:: passed|pass%2:38:03:: away, and they still|still%4:02:01:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: before them 
but the yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to grumble|grumble%2:32:02:: a bit. 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: surely|surely%4:02:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," he said, "and unless we find|find%2:40:02:: it again|again%4:02:00:: 
in time|time%1:28:05:: to reach|reach%2:38:01:: the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: I shall never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:40:00:: my brains." 
 
"Nor I my heart," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "It seems|seem%2:39:00:: to me I can 
scarcely|scarcely%4:02:00:: wait|wait%2:31:00:: till I get|get%2:38:00:: to Oz, and you must admit|admit%2:32:00:: this is|be%2:42:06:: a very|very%4:02:00:: 
long|long%3:00:02:: journey." 
 
"You see," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly|cowardly%3:00:00:: Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the 
courage|courage%1:07:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:07:: tramping|tramp%2:38:00:: forever, without getting|get%2:38:00:: anywhere|anywhere%4:02:00:: at all." 
 
 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Dorothy lost|lose%2:40:02:: heart. She sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the grass|grass%1:20:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her 
companions, and they sat|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: at her, and Toto found|find%2:39:02:: that 
for the first|first%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: in his life|life%1:28:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: to chase|chase%2:38:00:: a butterfly|butterfly%1:05:00:: 
that flew|fly%2:38:00:: past his head; so he put|put%2:35:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his tongue|tongue%1:08:00:: and panted|pant%2:32:00:: and 
looked|look%2:39:00:: at Dorothy as if to ask|ask%2:32:00:: what they should do|do%2:41:01:: next. 
 
"Suppose we call|call%2:32:01:: the Field|field%1:15:01:: Mice," she suggested. "They could probably|probably%4:02:00:: 
tell|tell%2:32:00:: us the way|way%1:04:01:: to the Emerald City." 
 
"To be|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: they could," cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow; "why didn't we think|think%2:31:00:: of 
that before?" 
 
Dorothy blew|blow%2:29:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: whistle|whistle%2:32:01:: she had|have%2:42:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: carried|carry%2:42:01:: about her neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
since the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice|mouse%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: it to her. In a few|few%3:00:00:: minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
they heard|hear%2:39:00:: the pattering of tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 feet, and many|many%3:00:00:: of the small|small%3:00:00:: grey|grey%3:00:00:achromatic:00 
mice|mouse%1:05:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her. Among them was|be%2:42:06:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: herself, who 
asked, in her squeaky little|little%3:00:01:: voice, 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for my friends?" 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. "Can you tell|tell%2:32:00:: us where the 
Emerald|emerald%1:21:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: is?" 
 
 
 
"Certainly," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Queen; "but it is|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 way|way%1:04:02:: off, for you 
have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: it at your backs|back%1:08:00:: all this time." Then|then%4:02:00:: she noticed|notice%2:39:04:: Dorothy's 
Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use|use%2:34:01:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Cap, and 
call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to you? They will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to the City|city%1:15:00:: of Oz 
in less|less%3:00:00:: than an hour." 
 
"I didn't know|know%2:31:01:: there was|be%2:42:00:: a charm," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in surprise. 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: written|write%2:36:02:: inside the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Queen|queen%1:18:01:: of the Mice; 
"but if you are|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to call|call%2:32:05:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: we must run|run%2:38:00:: away, 
for they are|be%2:42:03:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: and think|think%2:31:01:: it great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fun|fun%1:04:00:: to plague|plague%2:37:00:: us." 
 
"Won't they hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl, anxiously. 
 
"Oh, no; they must obey|obey%2:41:00:: the wearer|wearer%1:18:00:: of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she 
scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: out of sight, with all the mice|mouse%1:05:00:: hurrying|hurry%2:38:00:: after her. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: inside the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: some words|word%1:10:00:: written|write%2:36:01:: upon 
the lining. These, she thought, must be|be%2:42:06:: the charm, so she read|read%2:31:00:: the 
directions|direction%1:04:01:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and put|put%2:35:00:: the Cap|cap%1:06:00:: upon her head. 
 
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing|stand%2:35:00:: on her left|left%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"What did|do%2:41:01:: you say?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: know|know%2:31:01:: what she 
was|be%2:42:03:: doing. 
 
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went|go%2:38:00:: on, standing|standing%1:26:00:: this time|time%1:11:00:: on her 
right|right%3:00:00:: foot. 
 
"Hello!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, calmly. 
 
[Illustration: "_The Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00::

"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who was|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:05:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: on both 
feet. This ended|end%2:42:01:: the saying|saying%1:10:00:: of the charm, and they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
chattering|chatter%2:32:02:: and flapping|flap%2:38:03:: of wings, as the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
flew|fly%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to them. The King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: before Dorothy, and asked, 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: your command?" 
 
"We wish|wish%1:12:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: the child, "and we have|have%2:40:00:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: our way." 
 
"We will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the King, and no sooner|sooner%4:02:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: he spoken|speak%2:32:00:: 
than two of the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: caught|catch%2:35:00:: Dorothy in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
with her. Others took|take%2:38:09:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion, and 
one little|little%3:00:00:young:00 Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: Toto and flew|fly%2:38:00:: after them, although the dog|dog%1:05:00:: 
tried|try%2:41:00:: hard|hard%3:00:06:: to bite|bite%2:35:00:: him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: at first, 
for they remembered|remember%2:31:00:: how badly|badly%4:02:02:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:39:06:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: them 
before; but they saw|saw%2:35:00:: that no harm|harm%1:26:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: intended, so they rode|ride%2:38:01:: through 
the air|air%1:27:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: cheerfully, and had|have%2:39:06:: a fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 time|time%1:11:01:: looking|look%2:39:00:: at the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
gardens|garden%1:06:00:: and woods|wood%1:14:00:: far|far%4:02:02:: below them. 
 
Dorothy found|find%2:39:01:: herself riding|rid%2:40:00:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: between two of the biggest|big%3:00:00:proud:00 
Monkeys, one of them the King|king%1:18:00:: himself. They had|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:30:00:: a chair|chair%1:06:00:: of their 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: her. 
 
"Why do|do%2:41:01:: you have|have%2:40:00:: to obey|obey%2:41:00:: the charm|charm%1:06:00:: of the Golden Cap?" she asked. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: a long|long%3:00:02:: story," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the King, with a laugh; "but as we 
have|have%2:40:00:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey|journey%1:04:00:: before us I will pass|pass%2:42:00:: the time|time%1:28:05:: by telling|tell%2:32:00:: you 
about it, if you wish." 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to hear|hear%2:39:00:: it," she replied. 
 
"Once," began|begin%2:30:00:: the leader, "we were|be%2:42:03:: a free|free%3:00:00:: people, living|live%2:42:06:: happily|happily%4:02:01:: in 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 forest, flying|fly%2:38:00:: from tree|tree%1:20:00:: to tree, eating nuts|nut%1:20:00:: and fruit, 
and doing|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we pleased|please%2:37:01:: without calling|call%2:32:02:: anybody master. Perhaps|perhaps%4:02:00:: 
some of us were|be%2:42:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: too|too%4:02:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of mischief|mischief%1:04:00:: at times, flying|fly%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to 
pull|pull%2:35:00:: the tails|tail%1:05:00:: of the animals|animal%1:03:00:: that had|have%2:40:04:: no wings, chasing|chase%2:38:00:: birds, and 
throwing|throw%2:36:02:: nuts|nut%1:20:00:: at the people|people%1:14:00:: who walked|walk%2:38:00:: in the forest. But we were|be%2:42:03:: 
careless|careless%3:00:00:artless:00 and happy|happy%3:00:00:: and full|full%3:00:00:: of fun, and enjoyed|enjoy%2:37:00:: every minute|minute%1:28:00:: of the 
day. This was|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, long|long%4:02:00:: before Oz came|come%2:38:04:: out of the clouds|cloud%1:17:00:: 
to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over this land. 
 
"There lived|live%2:42:08:: here|here%4:02:00:: then, away|away%4:02:00:: at the North, a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: princess, who 
was|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: a powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: sorceress. All her magic|magic%1:09:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: used|use%2:34:01:: to help|help%2:41:00:: the 
people, and she was|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: known|know%2:31:02:: to hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: anyone who was|be%2:42:03:: good. Her name|name%1:26:00:: 
was|be%2:42:03:: Gayelette, and she lived|live%2:42:08:: in a handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 palace|palace%1:06:01:: built|build%2:36:00:: from great|great%3:00:01:large:00 
blocks|block%1:25:01:: of ruby. Everyone loved|love%2:37:00:: her, but her greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 sorrow|sorrow%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: that 
she could find|find%2:40:01:: no one|one%1:23:00:: to love|love%2:37:01:: in return, since all the men|man%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
too|too%4:02:00:: stupid|stupid%3:00:00:: and ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: to mate|mate%2:35:00:: with one so|so%4:02:02:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and wise. At last, 
however, she found|find%2:40:02:: a boy|boy%1:18:00:: who was|be%2:42:03:: handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 and manly|manly%3:00:00:: and wise|wise%3:00:00:: beyond 
his years. Gayelette made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: her mind|mind%1:09:04:: that when he grew|grow%2:30:04:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a man|man%1:18:00:: 
she would make|make%2:30:00:: him her husband, so she took|take%2:38:09:: him to her ruby|ruby%1:27:00:: palace|palace%1:14:00:: 
and used|use%2:34:01:: all her magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: him as strong|strong%3:00:00:: and good|good%3:00:01:: and 
lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 as any woman|woman%1:18:00:: could wish. When he grew|grow%2:30:03:: to manhood, Quelala, 
as he was|be%2:42:03:: called, was|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: the best|best%3:00:00:: and wisest|wise%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: in all the 
land, while his manly|manly%3:00:00:: beauty|beauty%1:07:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 that Gayelette loved|love%2:37:00:: him 
dearly, and hastened|hasten%2:30:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: everything ready|ready%3:00:00:: for the wedding. 
 
"My grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: at that time|time%1:28:00:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: which 
lived|live%2:42:08:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: near Gayalette's palace, and the old|old%3:00:02:: fellow|fellow%1:18:00:: loved|love%2:37:02:: 
a joke|joke%1:10:00:: better|better%4:02:00:: than a good|good%3:00:01:: dinner. One day, just|just%4:02:01:: before the wedding,

"'Swim out, my fine|fine%3:00:00:elegant:00 fellow,'" cried|cry%2:32:01:: my grandfather, "'and see|see%2:32:00:: if the 
water|water%1:13:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: spotted|spot%2:35:00:: your clothes.'" Quelala was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: wise|wise%3:00:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to 
swim, and he was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: in the least|least%3:00:00:: spoiled|spoil%2:41:01:: by all his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. He 
laughed, when he came|come%2:38:04:: to the top|top%1:15:01:: of the water, and swam in to shore. 
But when Gayelette came|come%2:38:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: to him she found|find%2:40:00:: his silks|silk%1:06:00:: and 
velvet|velvet%1:06:00:: all ruined|ruin%2:35:00:: by the river. 
 
 
 
"The princess|princess%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: angry, and she knew, of course, who did|do%2:41:01:: it. She 
had|have%2:30:00:: all the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: before her, and she said|say%2:32:00:: at first|first%3:00:00:: 
that their wings|wing%1:05:00:: should be|be%2:42:03:: tied|tie%2:35:00:: and they should be|be%2:42:03:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: as they had|have%2:40:00:: 
treated|treat%2:29:00:: Quelala, and dropped|drop%2:38:01:: in the river. But my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: pleaded|plead%2:32:03:: 
hard, for he knew|know%2:31:02:: the Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: would drown|drown%2:30:00:: in the river|river%1:17:00:: with their wings|wing%1:05:00:: 
tied, and Quelala said|say%2:32:00:: a kind|kind%1:09:00:: word|word%1:10:03:: for them also; so|so%4:02:05:: that Gayelette 
finally|finally%4:02:00:: spared|spar%2:32:00:: them, on condition|condition%1:10:01:: that the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: should ever|ever%4:02:00:: 
after do|do%2:41:01:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the bidding|bidding%1:10:02:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap. This 
Cap|cap%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:01:: for a wedding|wedding%1:11:00:: present|present%3:00:02:: to Quelala, and it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to 
have|have%2:42:00:: cost|cost%2:42:01:: the princess|princess%1:18:00:: half her kingdom. Of course|course%1:14:00:: my grandfather|grandfather%1:18:00:: and 
all the other|other%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to the condition, and that is|be%2:42:06:: 
how it happens|happen%2:30:00:: that we are|be%2:42:03:: three times|time%1:11:00:: the slaves|slave%1:18:00:: of the owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the 
Golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Cap, whomsoever he may be." 
 
"And what became|become%2:42:01:: of them?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who had|have%2:39:06:: been|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: 
interested|interested%3:00:00:: in the story. 
 
"Quelala being|be%2:42:06:: the first|first%3:00:00:: owner|owner%1:18:02:: of the Golden Cap," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Monkey, "he was|be%2:42:03:: the first|first%3:00:00:: to lay|lay%2:35:01:: his wishes|wish%1:12:00:: upon us. As his bride|bride%1:18:00:: 
could not|not%4:02:00:: bear|bear%2:31:00:: the sight|sight%1:09:00:: of us, he called|call%2:32:05:: us all to him in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: 
after he had|have%2:40:00:: married|marry%2:41:00:: her and ordered|order%2:32:01:: us to always|always%4:02:00:: keep|keep%2:40:00:: where she 
could never|never%4:02:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: eyes|eye%1:08:00:: on a Winged|winged%3:00:00:fast:01 Monkey, which we were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to 
do, for we were|be%2:42:03:: all afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of her. 
 
"This was|be%2:42:06:: all we ever|ever%4:02:04:: had|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: until the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: fell|fall%2:30:08:: into the 
hands|hand%1:08:00:: of the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: of the West, who made|make%2:32:00:: us enslave|enslave%2:41:00:: the 
Winkies, and afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: drive|drive%2:35:00:: Oz himself out of the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West. 
Now|now%4:02:00:: the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: yours, and three times|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: the right|right%1:07:00:: to 
lay|lay%2:35:01:: your wishes|wish%1:09:00:: upon us." 
 
As the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: finished|finish%2:30:01:: his story|story%1:10:03:: Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: the 
green, shining|shin%2:38:00:: walls|wall%1:17:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: before them. She wondered|wonder%2:31:00:: 
at the rapid|rapid%3:00:02:fast:01 flight|flight%1:04:01:: of the Monkeys, but was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: the journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
over. The strange|strange%3:00:00:: creatures|creature%1:03:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: before 
the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the City, the King|king%1:18:00:: bowed|bow%2:32:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: to Dorothy, and then|then%4:02:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: 
swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: away, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
"That was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: ride," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. 
 
"Yes, and a quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 way|way%1:04:01:: out of our troubles." replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion. "How 
lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 it was|be%2:42:06:: you brought|bring%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:01:: that wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Cap!" 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XV. 
 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:07:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: 
and rang|ring%2:39:01:: the bell. After ringing|ring%2:39:01:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 times|time%1:11:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: opened|open%2:35:00:: by the 
same|same%3:00:02:: Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gate|gate%1:06:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: before. 
 
"What! are|be%2:42:06:: you back|back%4:02:04:: again?" he asked, in surprise. 
 
"Do you not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: us?" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"But I thought|think%2:31:03:: you had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: to visit|visit%2:41:02:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West." 
 
"We did|do%2:41:01:: visit|visit%1:14:00:: her," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And she let|let%2:41:00:: you go|go%2:38:01:: again?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the man, in wonder. 
 
"She could not|not%4:02:00:: help|help%2:42:08:: it, for she is|be%2:42:03:: melted," explained|explain%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Melted! Well, that is|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: news, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the man. "Who melted|melt%2:30:00:: 
her?" 
 
"It was|be%2:42:06:: Dorothy," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, gravely. 
 
"Good gracious!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the man, and he bowed|bow%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: low|low%3:00:01:: indeed|indeed%4:02:03:: 
before her. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: he led|lead%2:38:01:: them into his little|little%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: and locked|lock%2:35:00:: the spectacles|spectacle%1:10:00:: 
from the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 box|box%1:06:02:: on all their eyes, just|just%4:02:05:: as he had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:36:01:: before. 
Afterward|afterward%4:02:00:: they passed|pass%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: through the gate|gate%1:06:00:: into the Emerald City, and 
when the people|people%1:14:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: from the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the Gate|gate%1:06:00:: that they had|have%2:40:00:: 
melted|melt%2:30:02:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: of the West|west%1:15:00:: they all gathered|gather%2:41:00:: around the 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: and followed|follow%2:38:00:: them in a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: still|still%4:02:01:: on guard|guard%1:07:00:: before the 
door, but he let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: at once|once%4:02:02:: and they were|be%2:42:03:: again|again%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: by the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl, who showed|show%2:38:00:: each of them to their old|old%3:00:01:: rooms|room%1:06:00:: at 
once, so they might rest|rest%2:32:00:: until the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to receive|receive%2:35:00:: them. 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: had|have%2:30:00:: the news|news%1:10:01:: carried|carry%2:36:00:: straight|straight%3:00:00:continuous:01 to Oz that Dorothy and the 
other|other%3:00:00:: travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: again, after destroying|destroy%2:36:00:: the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 
Witch; but Oz made|make%2:36:12:: no reply. They thought|think%2:31:03:: the Great|great%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: would send|send%2:35:00:: 
for them at once, but he did|do%2:41:01:: not. They had|have%2:40:00:: no word|word%1:10:02:: from him the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 
day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting|waiting%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: tiresome|tiresome%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 and wearing, 
and at last|last%3:00:00:past:00 they grew|grow%2:30:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: that Oz should treat|treat%2:41:00:: them in so|so%4:02:02:: poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 a 
fashion, after sending|send%2:38:01:: them to undergo|undergo%2:39:04:: hardships|hardship%1:26:01:: and slavery. So the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 asked|ask%2:32:01:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: to take|take%2:38:10:: another message|message%1:10:01:: to Oz, 
saying|say%2:32:00:: if he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: them in|in%4:02:01:: to see|see%2:41:11:: him at once|once%4:02:02:: they would call|call%2:32:01:: the 
Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to help|help%2:41:00:: them, and find|find%2:32:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: whether he kept|keep%2:41:03:: his promises|promise%1:10:00:: 
or not. When the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: given|give%2:40:07:: this message|message%1:10:01:: he was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 
that he sent|send%2:38:01:: word|word%1:10:02:: for them to come|come%2:38:04:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: at four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: 
after nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning. He had|have%2:40:00:: once|once%4:02:00:: met|meet%2:38:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
in the Land|land%1:15:02:: of the West, and he did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:02:: to meet|meet%2:38:01:: them again. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: a sleepless|sleepless%3:00:00:awake:00 night, each thinking|thinking%1:09:00:: of the 
gift|gift%1:21:00:: Oz had|have%2:39:06:: promised|promise%2:32:00:: to bestow|bestow%2:40:02:: upon him. Dorothy fell|fall%2:30:08:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: 
once, and then|then%4:02:00:: she dreamed|dream%2:39:00:: she was|be%2:42:05:: in Kansas, where Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: was|be%2:42:05:: 
telling|tell%2:32:04:: her how glad|glad%3:00:00:: she was|be%2:42:03:: to have|have%2:39:06:: her little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:04:: at home|home%1:15:04:: again. 
 
Promptly|promptly%4:02:00:: at nine o'clock|o'clock%4:02:00:: the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskered|whiskered%3:00:00:unshaven:00 soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: 
came|come%2:38:00:: to them, and four minutes|minute%1:28:00:: later|later%4:02:01:: they all went|go%2:38:00:: into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: 
Room|room%1:06:00:: of the Great|great%1:18:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Of course|course%1:14:00:: each one of them expected|expect%2:31:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: in the shape|shape%1:08:00:: 
he had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:31:03:: before, and all were|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: when they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
about and saw|saw%2:35:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: at all in the room. They kept|keep%2:42:03:: close|close%4:02:01:: to the door|door%1:06:01:: 
and closer|close%3:00:01:: to one another, for the stillness|stillness%1:07:00:: of the empty|empty%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
more|more%4:02:00:: dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 than any of the forms|form%1:03:00:: they had|have%2:40:00:: seen|see%2:39:00:: Oz take. 
 
 
 
Presently|presently%4:02:01:: they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a Voice, seeming|seem%2:39:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: from somewhere|somewhere%4:02:00:: near 
the top|top%1:15:01:: of the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 dome, and it said, solemnly. 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible. Why do|do%2:42:00:: you seek|seek%2:35:00:: me?" 
 
They looked|look%2:39:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: in every part|part%1:24:00:: of the room, and then, seeing|see%2:39:00:: no one, 
Dorothy asked, 
 
"Where are|be%2:42:05:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:05:: everywhere," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Voice, "but to the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: of common|common%3:00:02:: 
mortals|mortal%1:03:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: invisible. I|i%1:27:00:: will now|now%4:02:05:: seat|seat%1:06:00:: myself upon my throne, that 
you may converse|converse%2:32:00:: with me." Indeed, the Voice|voice%1:07:00:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: then|then%4:02:01:: to come|come%2:38:00:: 
straight|straight%4:02:04:: from the throne|throne%1:06:00:: itself; so they walked|walk%2:38:00:: toward it and stood|stand%2:35:00:: 
in a row|row%1:14:00:: while Dorothy said: 
 
"We have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: to claim|claim%2:40:00:: our promise, O|o%1:10:00:: Oz." 
 
"What promise?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"You promised|promise%2:32:00:: to send|send%2:38:01:: me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: when the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
destroyed," said|say%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:01:: to give|give%2:40:00:: me brains," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me a heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And you promised|promise%2:32:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: me courage," said|say%2:32:00:: the Cowardly Lion. 
 
"Is the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:: Witch|witch%1:18:00:: really|really%4:02:03:: destroyed?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Voice, and Dorothy 
thought|think%2:31:03:: it trembled|tremble%2:38:00:: a little. 
 
"Yes," she answered, "I melted|melt%2:30:01:: her with a bucket|bucket%1:06:00:: of water." 
 
"Dear me," said|say%2:32:00:: the Voice; "how sudden! Well, come|come%2:38:00:: to me to-morrow, 
for I must have|have%2:40:00:: time|time%1:28:05:: to think|think%2:31:00:: it over." 
 
"You've had|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of time|time%1:28:05:: already," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, angrily. 
 
"We shan't wait|wait%2:42:00:: a day|day%1:28:00:: longer," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You must keep|keep%2:41:03:: your promises|promise%1:10:00:: to us!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: it might be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: to frighten|frighten%2:37:00:: the Wizard, so|so%4:02:06:: 
he gave|give%2:41:00:: a large, loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar, which was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 and dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 that 
Toto jumped|jump%2:38:04:: away|away%4:02:00:: from him in alarm|alarm%1:12:00:: and tipped|tip%2:38:02:: over the screen|screen%1:06:05:: that 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: in a corner. As it fell|fall%2:38:00:: with a crash|crash%1:11:01:: they looked|look%2:39:00:: that way, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 moment|moment%1:28:00:: all of them were|be%2:42:03:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with wonder. For they 
saw, standing|standing%1:26:00:: in just|just%4:02:05:: the spot|spot%1:15:01:: the screen|screen%1:06:05:: had|have%2:40:00:: hidden, a little, old|old%3:00:02:: 
man, with a bald|bald%3:00:00:hairless:00 head|head%1:08:00:: and a wrinkled|wrinkled%3:00:00:: face, who seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: 
surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: as they were. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, raising|raise%2:38:00:: his axe, rushed|rush%2:33:00:: 
toward the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 man|man%1:18:00:: and cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" 
 
"I am|be%2:42:06:: Oz, the Great|great%1:18:00:: and Terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, in a 
trembling|tremble%2:38:00:: voice, "but don't strike|strike%1:11:00:: me--please don't!--and I'll do|do%2:36:01:: 
anything you want|want%2:37:00:: me to." 
 
Our friends|friend%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him in surprise|surprise%1:12:00:: and dismay. 
 
"I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:03:: a terrible|terrible%3:00:01:bad:00 Beast," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"And I thought|think%2:31:01:: Oz was|be%2:42:06:: a Ball|ball%1:25:00:: of Fire," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the Lion. 
 
"No; you are|be%2:42:03:: all wrong," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, meekly. "I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: 
making|make%2:31:00:: believe." 
 
"Making believe!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "Are you not|not%4:02:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard?" 
 
"Hush, my dear," he said; "don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: loud, or you will be|be%2:42:03:: 
overheard--and I should be|be%2:42:03:: ruined. I'm supposed|suppose%2:31:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: a Great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard." 
 
"And aren't you?" she asked. 
 
"Not a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of it, my dear; I'm just|just%4:02:00:: a common|common%3:00:00:lowborn:00 man." 
 
"You're more|more%3:00:02:: than that," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; 
"you're a humbug." 
 
"Exactly so!" declared|declare%2:32:06:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, rubbing|rub%2:35:00:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: as 
if it pleased|please%2:37:00:: him; "I am|be%2:42:03:: a humbug." 
 
"But this is|be%2:42:03:: terrible," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "how shall I ever|ever%4:02:04:: get|get%2:40:00:: 
my heart?" 
 
"Or I my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Or I my brains?" wailed|wail%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, wiping|wipe%2:35:00:: the the tears|tear%1:08:01:: from his 
eyes|eye%1:08:00:: with his coat-sleeve. 
 
 
 
"My dear|dear%4:02:00:: friends," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "I pray|pray%2:32:00:: you not|not%4:02:00:: to speak|speak%2:32:01:: of these 
little|little%4:02:00:: things. Think|think%2:31:00:: of me, and the terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 trouble|trouble%1:09:00:: I'm in at being|be%2:42:03:: 
found|find%2:32:00:: out." 
 
"Doesn't anyone else know|know%2:31:01:: you're a humbug?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No one knows|know%2:31:01:: it but you four--and myself," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I have|have%2:40:00:: 
fooled|fool%2:32:01:: everyone so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that I thought|think%2:31:03:: I should never|never%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:05:: found|find%2:31:09:: out. 
It was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 mistake|mistake%1:04:00:: my ever|ever%4:02:04:: letting|let%2:41:00:: you into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room. 
Usually|usually%4:02:00:: I will not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:38:00:: even|even%4:02:00:: my subjects, and so they believe|believe%2:31:04:: I am|be%2:42:06:: 
something terrible." 
 
"But, I don't understand," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was|be%2:42:03:: it 
that you appeared|appear%2:30:00:: to me as a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Head?" 
 
"That was|be%2:42:06:: one of my tricks," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "Step this way, please, and 
I will tell|tell%2:32:00:: you all about it." 
 
He led|lead%2:38:01:: the way|way%1:23:00:: to a small|small%3:00:00:: chamber|chamber%1:06:00:: in the rear|rear%1:15:00:: of the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, 
and they all followed|follow%2:38:00:: him. He pointed|point%2:32:00:: to one corner, in which lay|lay%2:35:00:: 
the Great|great%1:18:00:: Head, made|make%2:42:05:: out of many|many%3:00:00:: thicknesses|thickness%1:07:01:: of paper, and with a 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: painted|paint%2:36:01:: face. 
 
"This I hung|hang%2:35:00:: from the ceiling|ceiling%1:06:00:: by a wire," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "I stood|stand%2:35:00:: behind the 
screen|screen%1:06:04:: and pulled|pull%2:35:00:: a thread, to make|make%2:32:00:: the eyes|eye%1:08:00:: move|move%1:04:03:: and the mouth|mouth%1:08:01:: open." 
 
"But how about the voice?" she enquired. 
 
"Oh, I am|be%2:42:06:: a ventriloquist," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "and I can throw|throw%2:38:00:: 
the sound|sound%1:07:00:: of my voice|voice%1:07:00:: wherever I wish; so|so%4:02:06:: that you thought|think%2:31:01:: it was|be%2:42:06:: 
coming|come%2:42:03:: out of the Head. Here|here%4:02:00:: are|be%2:42:04:: the other|other%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:06:01:: I used|use%2:34:01:: to deceive|deceive%2:41:00:: 
you." He showed|show%2:39:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: the dress|dress%1:06:00:: and the mask|mask%1:06:00:: he had|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: when 
he seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:06:: the lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 Lady; and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: that his 
Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Beast|beast%1:03:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of skins, sewn together, with 
slats|slat%1:06:00:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: their sides|side%1:15:00:: out. As for the Ball|ball%1:06:03:: of Fire, the false|false%3:00:00:incorrect:00 
Wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: hung|hang%2:35:00:: that also|also%4:02:00:: from the ceiling. It was|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a ball|ball%1:25:00:: of 
cotton, but when oil|oil%1:27:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: poured|pour%2:38:03:: upon it the ball|ball%1:25:00:: burned|burned%3:00:00:treated:00 fiercely. 
 
"Really," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "you ought to be|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: of yourself 
for being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug." 
 
"I am--I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: am," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, sorrowfully; "but it 
was|be%2:42:03:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:04:00:: I could do. Sit|sit%2:38:00:: down, please, there are|be%2:42:04:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of 
chairs; and I will tell|tell%2:32:01:: you my story." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: they sat|sit%2:42:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and listened|listen%2:39:01:: while he told|tell%2:32:01:: the following|follow%2:42:05:: tale: 
 
"I was|be%2:42:03:: born|bear%2:29:01:: in Omaha--" 
 
"Why, that isn't very|very%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: from Kansas!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
"No; but it's farther|far%4:02:04:: from here," he said, shaking|shake%2:38:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: at her, 
sadly. "When I grew|grow%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: I became|become%2:42:01:: a ventriloquist, and at that I was|be%2:42:03:: 
very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: trained|train%2:31:01:: by a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 master. I can imitate|imitate%2:36:00:: any kind|kind%1:09:00:: of a 
bird|bird%1:05:00:: or beast." Here|here%4:02:00:: he mewed|mew%2:32:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: like a kitten|kitten%1:05:00:: that Toto pricked|prick%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
his ears|ear%1:08:01:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: everywhere|everywhere%4:02:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: where she was. "After a time," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: Oz, "I tired|tire%2:29:00:: of that, and became|become%2:42:01:: a balloonist." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: that?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A man|man%1:18:00:: who goes|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: on circus|circus%1:04:00:: day, so|so%4:02:06:: as to draw|draw%2:35:06:: a crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: 
of people|people%1:14:00:: together|together%4:02:03:: and get|get%2:32:00:: them to pay|pay%2:40:00:: to see|see%2:39:02:: the circus," he explained. 
 
 
 
"Oh," she said; "I know." 
 
"Well, one day|day%1:28:03:: I went|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: and the ropes|rope%1:06:00:: got|get%2:30:00:: twisted, so|so%4:02:09:: 
that I couldn't come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: again. It went|go%2:42:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: above the clouds, so|so%4:02:06:: 
far|far%4:02:02:: that a current|current%1:11:00:: of air|air%1:27:00:: struck|strike%2:35:01:: it and carried|carry%2:35:02:: it many, many|many%3:00:00:: miles|mile%1:23:01:: 
away. For a day|day%1:28:02:: and a night|night%1:28:00:: I travelled|travel%2:38:00:: through the air, and on the 
morning|morning%1:28:01:: of the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day|day%1:28:00:: I awoke|awake%2:29:00:: and found|find%2:39:02:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: floating|float%2:38:00:: over 
a strange|strange%3:00:00:: and beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country. 
 
"It came|come%2:30:03:: down|down%4:02:00:: gradually, and I was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: a bit. But I found|find%2:39:02:: myself 
in the midst|midst%1:15:00:: of a strange|strange%3:00:00:: people, who, seeing|see%2:39:00:: me come|come%2:38:00:: from the clouds, 
thought|think%2:31:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 Wizard. Of course|course%1:14:00:: I let|let%2:41:00:: them think|think%2:31:01:: so, because 
they were|be%2:42:03:: afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of me, and promised|promise%2:32:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: anything I wished|wish%2:37:02:: them to. 
 
"Just to amuse|amuse%2:41:00:: myself, and keep|keep%2:42:00:: the good|good%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: busy, I ordered|order%2:32:01:: them to 
build|build%2:36:00:: this City, and my palace; and they did|do%2:41:01:: it all|all%4:02:00:: willingly|willingly%4:02:00:: and well. 
Then|then%4:02:00:: I thought, as the country|country%1:15:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and beautiful, I would 
call|call%2:32:02:: it the Emerald City, and to make|make%2:30:00:: the name|name%1:10:00:: fit|fit%2:42:04:: better|better%3:00:00:advisable:00 I put|put%2:35:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 
spectacles|spectacle%1:06:00:: on all the people, so that everything they saw|saw%2:35:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: green." 
 
"But isn't everything here|here%4:02:00:: green?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"No more|more%3:00:02:: than in any other|other%3:00:00:: city," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz; "but when you wear|wear%2:29:00:: 
green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spectacles, why of course|course%1:17:00:: everything you see|see%2:39:00:: looks|look%1:07:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 to 
you. The Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: ago, for I was|be%2:42:03:: a 
young|young%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: when the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: me here, and I am|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: old|old%3:00:02:: man|man%1:18:04:: 
now. But my people|people%1:14:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: worn|wear%2:29:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 glasses|glass%1:06:03:: on their eyes|eye%1:08:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: long|long%4:02:00:: that 
most|most%3:00:02:: of them think|think%2:31:01:: it really|really%4:02:03:: is|be%2:42:03:: an Emerald City, and it certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: 
a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: place, abounding|abound%2:42:00:: in jewels|jewel%1:06:00:: and precious|precious%3:00:00:valuable:00 metals, and every 
good|good%3:00:01:: thing|thing%1:07:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: needed|need%2:42:00:: to make|make%2:30:00:: one happy. I have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to the 
people, and they like me; but ever|ever%4:02:04:: since this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: built|build%2:36:00:: I have|have%2:40:00:: 
shut|shut%2:35:00:: myself up|up%4:02:00:: and would not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: any of them. 
 
"One of my greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 fears|fear%1:12:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the Witches, for while I had|have%2:40:00:: no magical|magical%3:00:00:supernatural:00 
powers|power%1:07:00:: at all I soon|soon%4:02:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: out|out%4:02:04:: that the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: were|be%2:42:03:: really|really%4:02:03:: able|able%3:00:00:: to 
do|do%2:41:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 things. There were|be%2:42:00:: four of them in this country, and 
they ruled|rule%2:41:00:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who live|live%2:42:08:: in the North|north%1:15:02:: and South|south%1:15:01:: and East|east%1:15:00:: and 
West. Fortunately, the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the North|north%1:15:00:: and South|south%1:15:01:: were|be%2:42:03:: good, and 
I knew|know%2:31:01:: they would do|do%2:41:01:: me no harm; but the Witches|witch%1:18:03:: of the East|east%1:15:00:: and West|west%1:15:00:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: terribly|terribly%4:02:00:: wicked, and had|have%2:40:00:: they not|not%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:03:: I was|be%2:42:03:: more|more%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: 
than they themselves, they would surely|surely%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: destroyed|destroy%2:36:00:: me. As it was, 
I lived|live%2:42:01:: in deadly|deadly%3:00:01:fatal:00 fear|fear%1:12:00:: of them for many|many%3:00:00:: years; so you can imagine|imagine%2:36:00:: how 
pleased|please%2:37:01:: I was|be%2:42:03:: when I heard|hear%2:31:00:: your house|house%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: on the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:03:: 
of the East. When you came|come%2:38:00:: to me I was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to promise|promise%2:32:00:: anything if 
you would only|only%4:02:02:: do|do%2:36:01:: away|away%4:02:09:: with the other|other%3:00:00:: Witch; but, now|now%4:02:00:: that you have|have%2:41:00:: 
melted|melt%2:30:10:: her, I am|be%2:42:03:: ashamed|ashamed%3:00:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: that I cannot keep|keep%2:41:03:: my promises." 
 
"I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: man," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really|really%4:02:03:: a very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: man; but I'm a very|very%4:02:00:: bad|bad%3:00:00:: 
Wizard, I must admit." 
 
"Can't you give|give%2:40:00:: me brains?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You don't need them. You are|be%2:42:03:: learning|learn%2:31:00:: something every day. A|a%1:08:00:: baby|baby%1:18:00:: 
has|have%2:40:00:: brains, but it doesn't know|know%2:31:03:: much. Experience|experience%1:09:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:09:00:: 
that brings|bring%2:38:00:: knowledge, and the longer|long%3:00:02:: you are|be%2:42:05:: on earth|earth%1:15:00:: the more|more%3:00:01:: 
experience|experience%2:31:00:: you are|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:04:: to get." 
 
"That may all be|be%2:42:03:: true," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "but I shall be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01:: 
unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: unless you give|give%2:40:03:: me brains." 
 
The false|false%3:00:00:: wizard|wizard%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at him carefully. 
 
"Well," he said, with a sigh, "I'm not|not%4:02:00:: much|much%3:00:00:: of a magician, as I said; 
but if you will come|come%2:30:03:: to me to-morrow morning, I will stuff|stuff%2:35:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: 
with brains. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:00:: you how to use|use%2:34:01:: them, however; you must 
find|find%2:32:00:: that out|out%4:02:02:: for yourself." 
 
 
 
"Oh, thank|thank%2:32:00:: you--thank you!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "I'll find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to 
use|use%2:34:01:: them, never|never%4:02:00:: fear!" 
 
"But how about my courage?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, anxiously. 
 
"You have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of courage, I am|be%2:42:03:: sure," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "All you need|need%2:34:00:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: confidence|confidence%1:09:00:: in yourself. There is|be%2:42:00:: no living|live%2:42:01:: thing|thing%1:06:01:: that is|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: when it faces|face%2:33:00:: danger. True|true%1:07:00:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:06:: in facing|face%2:32:00:: danger|danger%1:26:00:: when 
you are|be%2:42:03:: afraid, and that kind|kind%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: in plenty." 
 
"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared|scar%2:35:00:: just|just%4:02:05:: the same," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion. "I 
shall really|really%4:02:03:: be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: unless you give|give%2:40:03:: me the sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: 
that makes|make%2:30:00:: one forget|forget%2:31:01:: he is|be%2:42:03:: afraid." 
 
"Very well; I will give|give%2:40:03:: you that sort|sort%1:09:00:: of courage|courage%1:07:00:: to-morrow," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"How about my heart?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"Why, as for that," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "I think|think%2:31:01:: you are|be%2:42:03:: wrong|wrong%3:00:01:: to want|want%2:37:00:: a 
heart. It makes|make%2:30:00:: most|most%3:00:02:: people|people%1:14:00:: unhappy. If you only|only%4:02:02:: knew|know%2:31:01:: it, you are|be%2:42:03:: in 
luck|luck%1:19:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: a heart." 
 
"That must be|be%2:42:06:: a matter|matter%1:09:01:: of opinion," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman. "For my 
part, I will bear|bear%2:31:00:: all the unhappiness|unhappiness%1:26:00:: without a murmur, if you will 
give|give%2:40:03:: me the heart." 
 
 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, meekly. "Come to me to-morrow and you shall 
have|have%2:40:00:: a heart. I have|have%2:40:00:: played|play%2:33:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: for so|so%4:02:02:: many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: that I may as 
well|well%4:02:03:: continue|continue%2:42:01:: the part|part%1:09:01:: a little|little%3:00:03:: longer." 
 
"And now," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "how am|be%2:42:06:: I to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" 
 
"We shall have|have%2:40:00:: to think|think%2:31:00:: about that," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man, "Give 
me two or three days|day%1:28:00:: to consider|consider%2:39:00:: the matter|matter%1:09:00:: and I'll try|try%2:41:00:: to find|find%2:40:02:: a

will wait|wait%2:42:00:: upon you and obey|obey%2:41:00:: your slightest|slight%3:00:00:: wish. There is|be%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:01:: one

secret|secret%1:10:00:: and tell|tell%2:32:04:: no one|one%1:23:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: a humbug." 
 
They agreed|agree%2:32:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: of what they had|have%2:40:00:: learned, and went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to 
their rooms|room%1:06:00:: in high|high%3:00:02:: spirits. Even|even%4:02:00:: Dorothy had|have%2:39:06:: hope|hope%1:12:00:: that "The Great|great%1:18:00:: 
and Terrible|terrible%3:00:00:alarming:00 Humbug," as she called|call%2:32:02:: him, would find|find%2:31:09:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to send|send%2:38:01:: her 
back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and if he did|do%2:36:01:: that she was|be%2:42:03:: willing|willing%3:00:00:: to forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: him 
everything. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVI. 
 
 
Next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: to his friends: 
 
"Congratulate me. I am|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: to Oz to get|get%2:39:00:: my brains|brain%1:09:00:: at last. When I 
return|return%2:32:01:: I shall be|be%2:42:03:: as other|other%3:00:00:: men|man%1:18:00:: are." 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: always|always%4:02:00:: liked|like%2:37:04:: you as you were," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, simply. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: kind|kind%1:09:00:: of you to like|like%2:37:05:: a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely|surely%4:02:00:: you 
will think|think%2:31:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: of me when you hear|hear%2:31:00:: the splendid|splendid%3:00:00:beautiful:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: my new|new%3:00:00:: brain|brain%1:09:01:: 
is|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:41:00:: to turn|turn%2:42:00:: out." Then|then%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: to them all in a cheerful|cheerful%3:00:00:: 
voice|voice%1:10:00:: and went|go%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room, where he rapped|rap%2:35:00:: upon the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: in and found|find%2:39:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man|man%1:18:00:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: by the 
window, engaged|engage%2:41:06:: in deep|deep%3:00:02:: thought. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my brains," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, a little|little%3:00:01:: uneasily. 
 
"Oh, yes; sit|sit%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in that chair, please," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "You must 
excuse|excuse%2:32:00:: me for taking|take%2:40:00:: your head|head%1:08:00:: off, but I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: it in 
order|order%1:07:00:: to put|put%2:35:05:: your brains|brain%1:08:00:: in their proper|proper%3:00:00:: place." 
 
"That's all right," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "You are|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: welcome|welcome%3:00:00:: to 
take|take%2:35:00:: my head|head%1:08:00:: off, as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as it will be|be%2:42:03:: a better|better%3:00:02:: one|one%1:23:00:: when you put|put%2:35:00:: it 
on again." 
 
So the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: unfastened|unfasten%2:35:01:: his head|head%1:08:00:: and emptied|empty%2:29:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: the straw. Then|then%4:02:00:: he 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the back|back%3:00:00:: room|room%1:06:00:: and took|take%2:40:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: a measure|measure%1:03:00:: of bran, which he mixed|mix%2:35:00:: 
with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 many|many%3:00:00:: pins|pin%1:06:00:: and needles. Having|have%2:39:06:: shaken|shake%2:38:00:: them together|together%4:02:02:: 
thoroughly, he filled|fill%2:30:01:: the top|top%1:15:01:: of the Scarecrow's head|head%2:42:04:: with the mixture|mixture%1:27:00:: 
and stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the space|space%1:25:00:: with straw, to hold|hold%2:42:00:: it in place. When 
he had|have%2:40:00:: fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: the Scarecrow's head|head%2:35:00:: on his body|body%1:08:00:: again|again%4:02:00:: he said|say%2:32:00:: to him, 
 
"Hereafter you will be|be%2:42:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:important:00 man, for I have|have%2:40:00:: given|give%2:40:00:: you a lot|lot%1:23:00:: of 
bran-new brains." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: both pleased|pleased%3:00:00:: and proud|proud%3:00:00:: at the fulfillment|fulfillment%1:04:00:: of his 
greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 wish, and having|have%2:39:06:: thanked|thank%2:32:00:: Oz warmly|warmly%4:02:01:: he went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends. 
 
Dorothy looked|look%2:39:00:: at him curiously. His head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: bulging|bulge%2:42:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: at 
the top|top%1:15:00:: with brains. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel?" she asked. 
 
 
 
"I feel|feel%2:37:00:: wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly. "When I get|get%2:30:00:: used|use%2:34:01:: to my 
brains|brain%1:08:00:: I shall know|know%2:31:01:: everything." 
 
"Why are|be%2:42:06:: those needles|needle%1:06:00:: and pins|pin%1:06:00:: sticking|stick%2:38:00:: out of your head?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the 
Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"That is|be%2:42:06:: proof|proof%1:09:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: sharp," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well, I must go|go%2:38:00:: to Oz and get|get%2:35:03:: my heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman. So he 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: entered|enter%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my heart." 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "But I shall have|have%2:40:00:: to cut|cut%2:35:00:: a hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in your breast, so I can put|put%2:35:05:: your heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the right|right%3:00:01:proper:00 place. I hope|hope%2:37:00:: it 
won't hurt|hurt%1:26:00:: you." 
 
"Oh, no;" answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "I shall not|not%4:02:00:: feel|feel%2:39:00:: it at all." 
 
 
 
So Oz brought|bring%2:35:00:: a pair|pair%1:14:01:: of tinners' shears and cut|cut%2:35:00:: a small, square|square%1:06:01:: hole|hole%1:17:01:: 
in the left|left%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman's breast. Then, going|go%2:38:00:: to a chest|chest%1:08:00:: 
of drawers, he took|take%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: a pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart, made|make%2:36:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: and 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:00:: with sawdust. 
 
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked. 
 
"It is, indeed!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Woodman, who was|be%2:42:03:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: pleased. "But 
is|be%2:42:03:: it a kind|kind%1:09:00:: heart?" 
 
"Oh, very!" answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: He put|put%2:35:00:: the heart|heart%1:09:00:: in the Woodman's breast|breast%1:08:01:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: replaced|replace%2:35:00:: the square|square%1:25:00:: of tin, soldering it neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: where 
it had|have%2:42:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: cut. 
 
"There," said|say%2:32:00:: he; "now you have|have%2:40:00:: a heart|heart%1:09:00:: that any man|man%1:18:00:: might be|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: 
of. I'm sorry I had|have%2:40:00:: to put|put%2:35:00:: a patch|patch%1:06:00:: on your breast, but it really|really%4:02:03:: 
couldn't be|be%2:42:03:: helped." 
 
"Never mind|mind%1:09:00:: the patch," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the happy|happy%3:00:00:: Woodman. "I am very|very%4:02:00:: 
grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: to you, and shall never|never%4:02:00:: forget|forget%2:31:01:: your kindness." 
 
 
 
"Don't speak|speak%2:32:00:: of it," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his friends, who wished|wish%2:32:00:: him every 
joy|joy%1:12:00:: on account|account%1:10:04:: of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: to the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. 
 
"Come in," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: for my courage," announced|announce%2:32:00:: the Lion, entering|enter%2:38:00:: the room. 
 
"Very well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man; "I will get|get%2:35:03:: it for you." 
 
He went|go%2:38:00:: to a cupboard|cupboard%1:06:00:: and reaching|reach%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to a high|high%3:00:01:: shelf|shelf%1:06:00:: took|take%2:38:10:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
a square|square%3:00:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 bottle, the contents|content%1:14:00:: of which he poured|pour%2:38:04:: into a 
green-gold dish, beautifully|beautifully%4:02:00:: carved. Placing this before the Cowardly 
Lion, who sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: at it as if he did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:05:: it, the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: said, 
 
"Drink." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: it?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Well," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz, "if it were|be%2:42:05:: inside|inside%3:00:00:: of you, it would be|be%2:42:06:: courage. 
You know, of course, that courage|courage%1:07:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: always|always%4:02:00:: inside|inside%4:02:01:: one; so that 
this really|really%4:02:03:: cannot be|be%2:42:03:: called|call%2:32:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: until you have|have%2:40:00:: swallowed|swallow%2:34:00:: it. 
Therefore|therefore%4:02:00:: I advise|advise%2:32:00:: you to drink|drink%2:34:00:: it as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: hesitated|hesitate%2:42:01:: no longer, but drank|drink%2:34:00:: till the dish|dish%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: empty. 
 
"How do|do%2:41:01:: you feel|feel%2:29:00:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Full of courage," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the Lion, who went|go%2:38:00:: joyfully|joyfully%4:02:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to his 
friends|friend%1:18:00:: to tell|tell%2:32:00:: them of his good|good%3:00:01:: fortune. 
 
Oz, left|leave%2:42:02:: to himself, smiled|smile%2:29:00:: to think|think%2:36:00:: of his success|success%1:04:00:: in giving|give%2:40:03:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:06:01:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: exactly|exactly%4:02:01:: what they thought|think%2:31:01:: 
they wanted. "How can I help|help%2:41:00:: being|be%2:42:03:: a humbug," he said, "when all 
these people|people%1:14:00:: make|make%2:36:15:: me do|do%2:41:01:: things|thing%1:04:00:: that everybody knows|know%2:31:01:: can't be|be%2:42:03:: done? It 
was|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: happy, 
because they imagined|imagine%2:36:00:: I could do|do%2:41:01:: anything. But it will take|take%2:42:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: than 
imagination|imagination%1:09:03:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: Dorothy back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, and I'm sure|sure%3:00:00:: I don't 
know|know%2:31:01:: how it can be|be%2:42:03:: done."

For three days|day%1:28:00:: Dorothy heard|hear%2:39:00:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: from Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: These were|be%2:42:03:: sad|sad%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: 
for the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl, although her friends|friend%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all quite|quite%4:02:02:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: and 
contented. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: told|tell%2:32:04:: them there were|be%2:42:04:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 thoughts|thought%1:09:01:: in 
his head; but he would not|not%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: what they were|be%2:42:06:: because he knew|know%2:31:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: 
could understand|understand%2:31:00:: them but himself. When the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: about 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast; and he told|tell%2:32:04:: Dorothy 
he had|have%2:40:00:: discovered|discover%2:36:00:: it to be|be%2:42:03:: a kinder|kind%3:00:00:: and more|more%3:00:01:: tender|tender%1:18:00:: heart|heart%1:09:00:: than the 
one he had|have%2:40:00:: owned|own%2:40:00:: when he was|be%2:42:02:: made|make%2:30:00:: of flesh. The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: declared|declare%2:32:00:: he was|be%2:42:06:: 
afraid|afraid%3:00:00:: of nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: on earth, and would gladly|gladly%4:02:00:: face|face%2:33:00:: an army|army%1:14:00:: of men|man%1:18:00:: or a 
dozen|dozen%1:23:00:: of the fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 Kalidahs. 
 
Thus|thus%4:02:00:: each of the little|little%3:00:01:: party|party%1:14:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: satisfied|satisfy%2:37:00:: except Dorothy, who 
longed|long%2:37:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: than ever|ever%4:02:04:: to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas. 
 
On the fourth|fourth%3:00:00:ordinal:00 day, to her great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 joy, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: for her, and when she 
entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: he said, pleasantly: 
 
"Sit down, my dear; I think|think%2:31:03:: I have|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:31:09:: the way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:30:02:: you out of 
this country." 
 
"And back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas?" she asked, eagerly. 
 
"Well, I'm not|not%4:02:00:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: about Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz; "for I haven't the 
faintest|faint%3:00:00:perceptible:00 notion|notion%1:09:02:: which way|way%1:15:00:: it lies. But the first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert, and then|then%4:02:00:: it should be|be%2:42:03:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: to find|find%2:36:00:: your way|way%1:23:00:: home." 
 
"How can I cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert?" she enquired. 
 
"Well, I'll tell|tell%2:32:00:: you what I|i%1:23:00:: think," said|say%2:32:00:: the little|little%3:00:01:: man. "You see, 
when I came|come%2:38:04:: to this country|country%1:15:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: in a balloon. You also|also%4:02:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: 
through the air, being|be%2:42:03:: carried|carry%2:35:12:: by a cyclone. So I believe|believe%2:31:00:: the best|best%3:00:00:: 
way|way%1:04:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: across the desert|desert%1:15:00:: will be|be%2:42:06:: through the air. Now, it is|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: beyond my powers|power%1:09:01:: to make|make%2:36:00:: a cyclone; but I've been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: the 
matter|matter%1:09:01:: over, and I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I can make|make%2:36:01:: a balloon." 
 
"How?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"A balloon," said|say%2:32:00:: Oz, "is made|make%2:36:05:: of silk, which is|be%2:42:03:: coated|coat%2:29:00:: with glue|glue%1:27:00:: to 
keep|keep%2:42:00:: the gas|gas%1:27:00:: in it. I have|have%2:40:00:: plenty|plenty%1:07:00:: of silk|silk%1:06:00:: in the Palace, so it will 
be|be%2:42:02:: no trouble|trouble%1:11:01:: for us to make|make%2:36:00:: the balloon. But in all this country|country%1:14:01:: 
there is|be%2:42:00:: no gas|gas%1:27:02:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: with, to make|make%2:32:00:: it float." 
 
"If it won't float," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "it will be|be%2:42:03:: of no use|use%1:07:00:: to us." 
 
"True," answered|answer%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "But there is|be%2:42:00:: another way|way%1:04:01:: to make|make%2:30:00:: it float, 
which is|be%2:42:06:: to fill|fill%2:30:01:: it with hot|hot%3:00:01:: air. Hot air|air%1:27:00:: isn't as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as gas, for 
if the air|air%1:27:00:: should get|get%2:30:00:: cold|cold%3:00:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: would come|come%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: in the desert, 
and we should be|be%2:42:03:: lost." 
 
"We!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: the girl; "are you going|go%2:38:00:: with me?" 
 
"Yes, of course," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: "I am tired|tire%2:29:00:: of being|be%2:42:03:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a humbug. If I 
should go|go%2:38:01:: out of this Palace|palace%1:06:00:: my people|people%1:14:00:: would soon|soon%4:02:00:: discover|discover%2:31:00:: I am|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a 
Wizard, and then|then%4:02:00:: they would be|be%2:42:03:: vexed|vex%2:37:02:: with me for having|have%2:30:00:: deceived|deceive%2:32:00:: them. 
So|so%4:02:09:: I have|have%2:40:00:: to stay|stay%2:30:00:: shut|shut%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: in these rooms|room%1:06:00:: all day, and it gets|get%2:30:00:: tiresome. 
I'd much|much%4:02:00:: rather|rather%4:02:01:: go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: with you and be|be%2:42:05:: in a circus|circus%1:14:00:: again." 
 
 
 
"I shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to have|have%2:41:00:: your company," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if you will help|help%2:41:00:: me sew|sew%2:35:00:: the silk|silk%1:06:00:: 
together, we will begin|begin%2:30:00:: to work|work%2:41:02:: on our balloon." 
 
So Dorothy took|take%2:35:00:: a needle|needle%1:06:00:: and thread, and as|as%4:02:00:: fast|fast%4:02:01:: as Oz cut|cut%2:35:00:: the strips|strip%1:17:00:: 
of silk|silk%1:06:00:: into proper|proper%3:00:00:: shape|shape%1:09:00:: the girl|girl%1:18:00:: sewed|sew%2:35:00:: them neatly|neatly%4:02:00:: together. First|first%1:24:00:: 
there was|be%2:42:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of light|light%3:00:05:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk, then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of dark|dark%3:00:02:: green|green%1:07:00:: and 
then|then%4:02:00:: a strip|strip%1:17:00:: of emerald green; for Oz had|have%2:40:00:: a fancy|fancy%1:12:00:: to make|make%2:36:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: 
in different|different%3:00:00:: shades|shade%1:07:00:: of the color|color%1:07:00:: about them. It took|take%2:40:06:: three days|day%1:28:00:: to 
sew|sew%2:35:00:: all the strips|strip%1:17:00:: together, but when it was|be%2:42:03:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: they had|have%2:40:01:: a big|big%3:00:01:: 
bag|bag%1:06:00:: of green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 silk|silk%1:06:00:: more|more%3:00:02:: than twenty feet|foot%1:23:00:: long. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz painted|paint%2:35:00:: it on the inside|inside%1:15:00:: with a coat|coat%1:06:01:: of thin|thin%3:00:01:: glue, to make|make%2:30:00:: it 
air-tight, after which he announced|announce%2:32:00:: that the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. 
 
"But we must have|have%2:40:00:: a basket|basket%1:06:00:: to ride|ride%2:38:01:: in," he said. So he sent|send%2:38:01:: the 
soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers|whisker%1:05:00:: for a big|big%3:00:01:: clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: basket, which he 
fastened|fasten%2:35:01:: with many|many%3:00:00:: ropes|rope%1:06:00:: to the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of the balloon. 
 
When it was|be%2:42:03:: all ready, Oz sent|send%2:35:00:: word|word%1:10:06:: to his people|people%1:14:00:: that he was|be%2:42:03:: going|go%2:38:00:: 
to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit|visit%1:04:02:: to a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 brother|brother%1:18:00:: Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in the clouds. 
The news|news%1:10:00:: spread|spread%2:32:02:: rapidly|rapidly%4:02:00:: throughout the city|city%1:15:00:: and everyone came|come%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: 
the wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 sight. 
 
Oz ordered|order%2:32:01:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: carried|carry%2:35:02:: out|out%4:02:04:: in front|front%1:15:02:: of the Palace, and the 
people|people%1:14:00:: gazed|gaze%2:39:00:: upon it with much|much%3:00:00:: curiosity. The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: a 
big|big%3:00:01:: pile|pile%1:14:00:: of wood, and now|now%4:02:05:: he made|make%2:36:00:: a fire|fire%1:22:00:: of it, and Oz held|hold%2:35:01:: the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: 
of the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: over the fire|fire%1:06:00:: so that the hot|hot%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: that arose|arise%2:42:00:: from it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: in the silken|silken%3:00:00:bright:00 bag. Gradually|gradually%4:02:00:: the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: swelled|swell%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
and rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air, until finally|finally%4:02:02:: the basket|basket%1:06:00:: just|just%4:02:00:: touched|touch%2:35:00:: the ground. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Oz got|get%2:38:12:: into the basket|basket%1:06:00:: and said|say%2:32:00:: to all the people|people%1:14:00:: in a loud|loud%3:00:00:: voice: 
 
"I am|be%2:42:03:: now|now%4:02:00:: going|go%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to make|make%2:41:00:: a visit. While I am|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:38:01:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: 
will rule|rule%2:41:00:: over you. I command|command%2:32:00:: you to obey|obey%2:41:00:: him as you would me." 
 
The balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: by this time|time%1:11:00:: tugging|tug%2:35:00:: hard|hard%4:02:00:: at the rope|rope%1:06:00:: that held|hold%2:35:01:: it to 
the ground, for the air|air%1:27:00:: within it was|be%2:42:03:: hot, and this made|make%2:30:00:: it so|so%4:02:02:: much|much%4:02:00:: 
lighter|light%3:00:01:: in weight|weight%1:07:00:: than the air|air%1:27:00:: without that it pulled|pull%2:35:00:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: to rise|rise%2:38:00:: 
into the sky. 
 
"Come, Dorothy!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the Wizard; "hurry up, or the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: will fly|fly%2:38:00:: 
away." 
 
"I can't find|find%2:40:00:: Toto anywhere," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Dorothy, who did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: wish|wish%2:37:00:: to 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: behind. Toto had|have%2:42:00:: run|run%2:38:00:: into the crowd|crowd%1:14:00:: to bark|bark%1:11:00:: at 
a kitten, and Dorothy at last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 found|find%2:40:00:: him. She picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up|up%4:02:00:: and ran|run%2:38:00:: 
toward the balloon. 
 
 
 
She was|be%2:42:05:: within a few|few%3:00:00:: steps|step%1:04:00:: of it, and Oz was|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:35:01:: out|out%4:02:04:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: 
to help|help%2:41:00:: her into the basket, when, crack! went|go%2:38:00:: the ropes, and the 
balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: without her. 
 
 
 
"Come back!" she screamed; "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go, too!" 
 
"I can't come|come%2:38:00:: back, my dear," called|call%2:32:09:: Oz from the basket. "Good-bye!" 
 
"Good-bye!" shouted|shout%2:32:01:: everyone, and all eyes|eye%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: upward|upward%4:02:00:: to 
where the Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: riding|rid%2:40:00:: in the basket, rising|rise%2:38:00:: every moment|moment%1:28:00:: 
farther|far%4:02:00:: and farther|far%4:02:00:: into the sky. 
 
And that was|be%2:42:03:: the last|last%3:00:00:: any of them ever|ever%4:02:04:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: of Oz, the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 Wizard, 
though he may have|have%2:40:00:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: Omaha|omaha%1:15:00:: safely, and be|be%2:42:05:: there|there%4:02:00:: now, for all we 
know. But the people|people%1:14:00:: remembered|remember%2:31:02:: him lovingly, and said|say%2:32:00:: to one another, 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: our friend. When he was|be%2:42:05:: here|here%4:02:00:: he built|build%2:36:00:: for us this 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Emerald City, and now|now%4:02:05:: he is|be%2:42:03:: gone|go%2:30:08:: he has|have%2:40:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: the Wise|wise%1:07:00:: 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over us." 
 
Still, for many|many%3:00:00:: days|day%1:28:00:: they grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: over the loss|loss%1:11:01:: of the Wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 
Wizard, and would not|not%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: comforted. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XVIII. 
 
 
Dorothy wept|weep%2:29:00:: bitterly|bitterly%4:02:00:: at the passing|passing%1:11:02:: of her hope|hope%1:12:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: home|home%1:15:02:: to 
Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: again; but when she thought|think%2:31:00:: it all over she was|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: she had|have%2:40:00:: 
not|not%4:02:00:: gone|go%2:30:04:: up|up%4:02:00:: in a balloon. And she also|also%4:02:00:: felt|feel%2:37:00:: sorry|sorry%3:00:02:: at losing|lose%2:40:02:: Oz, and 
so|so%4:02:09:: did|do%2:41:01:: her companions. 
 
The Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: to her and said, 
 
"Truly I should be|be%2:42:03:: ungrateful|ungrateful%3:00:00:unpleasant:00 if I failed|fail%2:41:02:: to mourn|mourn%2:37:00:: for the man|man%1:18:00:: who gave|give%2:36:00:: 
me my lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart. I should like|like%2:37:01:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: a little|little%3:00:03:: because Oz is|be%2:42:03:: gone, 
if you will kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: wipe|wipe%2:35:00:: away|away%4:02:03:: my tears, so that I shall not|not%4:02:00:: rust." 
 
 
 
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought|bring%2:35:00:: a towel|towel%1:06:00:: at once. Then|then%4:02:00:: 
the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: wept|weep%2:29:00:: for several|several%3:00:00:some:00 minutes, and she watched|watch%2:39:00:: the tears|tear%1:08:01:: 
carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: and wiped|wipe%2:35:00:: them away|away%4:02:03:: with the towel. When he had|have%2:40:01:: finished|finish%2:30:02:: 
he thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: and oiled|oil%2:35:00:: himself thoroughly|thoroughly%4:02:00:: with his jewelled 
oil-can, to guard|guard%2:33:00:: against mishap. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of the Emerald City, and although 
he was|be%2:42:06:: not|not%4:02:00:: a Wizard|wizard%1:18:01:: the people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: proud|proud%3:00:00:: of him. "For," they said, 
"there is|be%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: another city|city%1:15:00:: in all the world|world%1:05:00:: that is|be%2:42:03:: ruled|rule%2:41:00:: by a 
stuffed|stuff%2:35:01:: man." And, so|so%4:02:05:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they knew, they were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: right. 
 
The morning|morning%1:28:00:: after the balloon|balloon%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: with Oz the four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: 
met|meet%2:41:00:: in the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:06:00:: and talked|talk%2:32:01:: matters|matter%1:09:01:: over. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: sat|sit%2:35:00:: in 
the big|big%3:00:01:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: and the others stood|stand%2:35:00:: respectfully|respectfully%4:02:00:: before him. 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: unlucky," said|say%2:32:00:: the new|new%3:00:00:: ruler; "for this Palace|palace%1:06:01:: and 
the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: belong|belong%2:40:00:: to us, and we can do|do%2:41:01:: just|just%4:02:05:: as we please. When 
I remember|remember%2:31:00:: that a short|short%3:00:02:: time|time%1:28:05:: ago I was|be%2:42:05:: up|up%4:02:00:: on a pole|pole%1:06:00:: in a farmer's 
cornfield, and that I am|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:05:: the ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: of this beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City, I am|be%2:42:06:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: satisfied|satisfied%3:00:00:contented:00 with my lot." 
 
"I also," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:06:00:: Woodman, "am well|well%4:02:05:: pleased|please%2:37:00:: with my new|new%3:00:00:: heart; 
and, really, that was|be%2:42:06:: the only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:26:00:: I wished|wish%2:32:02:: in all the world." 
 
"For my part, I am|be%2:42:03:: content|content%1:24:00:: in knowing|know%2:31:02:: I am|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: brave|brave%2:42:00:: as any beast|beast%1:03:00:: that 
ever|ever%4:02:00:: lived, if not|not%4:02:00:: braver," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, modestly, 
 
 
 
"If Dorothy would only|only%4:02:02:: be|be%2:42:03:: contented|contented%3:00:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: in the Emerald City," 
continued|continue%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "we might all be|be%2:42:03:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: together." 
 
"But I don't want|want%2:37:00:: to live|live%2:42:08:: here," cried|cry%2:32:01:: Dorothy. "I want|want%2:37:00:: to go|go%2:38:00:: to 
Kansas, and live|live%2:42:08:: with Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: and Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry." 
 
"Well, then, what can be|be%2:42:03:: done?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: decided|decide%2:31:00:: to think, and he thought|think%2:31:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: hard|hard%3:00:02:: that the pins|pin%1:06:00:: 
and needles|needle%1:06:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to stick|stick%2:35:03:: out of his brains. Finally|finally%4:02:02:: he said: 
 
"Why not|not%4:02:00:: call|call%2:32:01:: the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, and asked|ask%2:32:01:: them to carry|carry%2:35:02:: you over 
the desert?" 
 
"I never|never%4:02:00:: thought|think%2:31:00:: of that!" said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, joyfully. "It's just|just%4:02:00:: the 
thing. I'll go|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:02:: for the Golden Cap." 
 
When she brought|bring%2:38:00:: it into the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room|room%1:23:00:: she spoke|speak%2:32:00:: the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 words, 
and soon|soon%4:02:00:: the band|band%1:14:01:: of Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: flew|fly%2:38:00:: in|in%4:02:01:: through an open|open%3:00:01:: window|window%1:17:00:: 
and stood|stand%2:35:00:: beside her. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: the second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 time|time%1:11:00:: you have|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:32:01:: us," said|say%2:32:00:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King, 
bowing|bow%2:38:00:: before the little|little%3:00:01:: girl. "What do|do%2:41:01:: you wish?" 
 
"I want|want%2:37:00:: you to fly|fly%2:38:00:: with me to Kansas," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
But the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: his head. 
 
"That cannot be|be%2:42:03:: done," he said. "We belong|belong%2:40:00:: to this country|country%1:14:01:: alone, and 
cannot leave|leave%1:04:00:: it. There has|have%2:42:00:: never|never%4:02:00:: been|be%2:42:04:: a Winged Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: in Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: yet, 
and I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there never|never%4:02:00:: will be, for they don't belong|belong%2:42:06:: there. We 
shall be|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to serve|serve%2:41:01:: you in any way|way%1:07:01:: in our power, but we cannot 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. Good-bye." 
 
And with another bow|bow%1:10:01:: the Monkey|monkey%1:05:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: spread|spread%2:35:03:: his wings|wing%1:05:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
through the window, followed|follow%2:38:00:: by all his band. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: almost|almost%4:02:00:: ready|ready%3:00:00:: to cry|cry%2:29:00:: with disappointment. 
 
"I have|have%2:40:00:: wasted|waste%2:34:00:: the charm|charm%1:07:00:: of the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: to no purpose," she said, 
"for the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: cannot help|help%1:04:00:: me." 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: bad!" said|say%2:32:00:: the tender|tender%1:06:02:: hearted Woodman. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again, and his head|head%1:08:00:: bulged|bulge%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: so|so%4:02:02:: horribly|horribly%4:02:00:: 
that Dorothy feared|fear%2:37:03:: it would burst. 
 
"Let us call|call%2:32:05:: in the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers," he said, "and 
ask|ask%2:32:00:: his advice." 
 
 
 
So the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: summoned|summon%2:32:00:: and entered|enter%2:38:00:: the Throne|throne%1:06:00:: Room timidly, for 
while Oz was|be%2:42:03:: alive|alive%3:00:01:: he never|never%4:02:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: allowed|allow%2:41:00:: to come|come%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: than the door. 
 
"This little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to the soldier, "wishes to 
cross|cross%2:38:00:: the desert. How can she do|do%2:41:01:: so?" 
 
"I cannot tell," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the soldier; "for nobody|nobody%1:18:00:: has|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: crossed|cross%2:38:00:: 
the desert, unless it is|be%2:42:06:: Oz himself." 
 
"Is there|there%4:02:00:: no one|one%1:23:00:: who can help|help%2:41:00:: me?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy, earnestly. 
 
"Glinda might," he suggested. 
 
"Who is|be%2:42:06:: Glinda?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"The Witch|witch%1:18:01:: of the South. She is|be%2:42:03:: the most|most%4:02:00:: powerful|powerful%3:00:00:: of all the Witches, 
and rules|rule%1:26:00:: over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle|castle%1:06:02:: stands|stand%2:35:00:: on the edge|edge%1:15:00:: 
of the desert, so she may know|know%2:31:03:: a way|way%1:04:01:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: Witch, isn't she?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
"The Quadlings think|think%2:31:01:: she is|be%2:42:03:: good," said|say%2:32:00:: the soldier, "and she is|be%2:42:03:: kind 
to everyone. I have|have%2:40:00:: heard|hear%2:31:00:: that Glinda is|be%2:42:03:: a beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: woman, who knows|know%2:31:01:: 
how to keep|keep%2:42:03:: young|young%3:00:00:: in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of the many|many%3:00:00:: years|year%1:28:01:: she has|have%2:40:00:: lived." 
 
"How can I get|get%2:38:00:: to her castle?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"The road|road%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: straight|straight%3:00:01:: to the South," he answered, "but it is|be%2:42:03:: said|say%2:32:01:: to be|be%2:42:03:: 
full|full%3:00:02:ample:00 of dangers|danger%1:26:01:: to travellers. There are|be%2:42:04:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: in the woods, and 
a race|race%1:14:00:: of queer|queer%3:00:00:strange:00 men|man%1:18:00:: who do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: like|like%2:37:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: to cross|cross%2:38:00:: their country. 
For this reason|reason%1:16:00:: none|none%1:28:00:: of the Quadlings ever|ever%4:02:04:: come|come%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City." 
 
The soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: then|then%4:02:00:: left|leave%2:38:01:: them and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"It seems, in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of dangers, that the best|best%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: Dorothy can do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: 
to travel|travel%2:38:00:: to the Land|land%1:26:00:: of the South|south%1:15:02:: and ask|ask%2:32:01:: Glinda to help|help%2:41:00:: her. For, 
of course, if Dorothy stays|stay%2:30:00:: here|here%4:02:00:: she will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"You must have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: thinking|think%2:31:00:: again," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. 
 
"I have," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"I shall go|go%2:38:00:: with Dorothy," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Lion, "for I am|be%2:42:03:: tired|tired%3:00:00:: of your 
city|city%1:15:00:: and long|long%3:00:02:: for the woods|wood%1:14:00:: and the country|country%1:15:01:: again. I am|be%2:42:06:: really|really%4:02:03:: a wild|wild%3:00:02:: 
beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need|need%2:34:00:: someone|someone%1:03:00:: to protect|protect%2:33:00:: her." 
 
"That is|be%2:42:03:: true," agreed|agree%2:32:00:: the Woodman. "My axe|axe%1:06:00:: may be|be%2:42:03:: of service|service%1:07:00:: to her; 
so|so%4:02:05:: I, also, will go|go%2:38:00:: with her to the Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South." 
 
"When shall we start?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise. 
 
"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never|never%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: brains. 
She lifted|lift%2:38:00:: me from the pole|pole%1:06:00:: in the cornfield|cornfield%1:15:00:: and brought|bring%2:38:00:: me to the 
Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. So my good|good%3:00:01:: luck|luck%1:26:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: all due|due%3:00:02:: to her, and I shall never|never%4:02:00:: 
leave|leave%2:31:05:: her until she starts|start%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: for good|good%3:00:01:: and all." 
 
"Thank you," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, gratefully. "You are|be%2:42:03:: all very|very%3:00:00:same:02 kind|kind%1:09:00:: to me. 
But I should like|like%2:37:01:: to start|start%2:30:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"We shall go|go%2:38:00:: to-morrow morning," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Scarecrow. "So now|now%4:02:00:: let|let%2:41:00:: 
us all get|get%2:30:00:: ready, for it will be|be%2:42:03:: a long|long%3:00:02:: journey." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XIX. 
 
 
The next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 morning|morning%1:28:00:: Dorothy kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: good-bye, and 
they all shook|shake%2:32:00:: hands|hand%1:08:00:: with the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: with the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 whiskers, who 
had|have%2:40:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with them as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as the gate. When the Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: of the 
Gate|gate%1:06:00:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: them again|again%4:02:00:: he wondered|wonder%2:32:01:: greatly|greatly%4:02:00:: that they could leave|leave%2:38:01:: the 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: to get|get%2:30:00:: into new|new%3:00:00:: trouble. But he at once|once%4:02:02:: unlocked|unlock%2:30:00:: their 
spectacles, which he put|put%2:35:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: into the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 box, and gave|give%2:40:00:: them many|many%3:00:00:: 
good|good%3:00:01:: wishes|wish%1:10:01:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: with them. 
 
"You are|be%2:42:06:: now|now%4:02:00:: our ruler," he said|say%2:32:00:: to the Scarecrow; "so you must come|come%2:38:00:: 
back|back%4:02:04:: to us as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as possible." 
 
"I certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: shall if I am|be%2:42:03:: able," the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: replied; "but I must 
help|help%2:41:00:: Dorothy to get|get%2:38:00:: home, first." 
 
As Dorothy bade|bid%2:32:01:: the good-natured|good-natured%3:00:00:: Guardian|guardian%1:18:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 farewell|farewell%1:10:00:: she said, 
 
"I have|have%2:41:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: in your lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 City, and everyone 
has|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: good|good%3:00:01:: to me. I cannot tell|tell%2:32:04:: you how grateful|grateful%3:00:00:: I am." 
 
"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like|like%2:37:01:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: you with 
us, but if it is|be%2:42:06:: your wish|wish%1:12:00:: to return|return%2:38:00:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: I hope|hope%2:37:01:: you will find|find%2:40:02:: a 
way." He then|then%4:02:00:: opened|open%2:35:00:: the gate|gate%1:06:00:: of the outer|out%3:00:00:outer:00 wall|wall%1:06:00:: and they walked|walk%2:38:00:: forth|forth%4:02:00:: 
and started|start%2:30:00:: upon their journey. 
 
The sun|sun%1:17:00:: shone|shine%2:43:00:: brightly|brightly%4:02:00:: as our friends|friend%1:18:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: their faces|face%1:08:00:: toward the 
Land|land%1:15:01:: of the South. They were|be%2:42:03:: all in the best|best%3:00:00:: of spirits, and laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: 
and chatted|chat%2:32:00:: together. Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: once|once%4:02:02:: more|more%4:02:00:: filled|fill%2:30:01:: with the hope|hope%1:12:01:: of 
getting|get%2:32:00:: home, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:05:: 
of use|use%1:07:00:: to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed|sniff%2:39:00:: the fresh|fresh%3:00:01:: air|air%1:27:00:: with delight|delight%1:09:00:: 
and whisked|whisk%2:35:00:: his tail|tail%1:05:00:: from side|side%1:15:02:: to side|side%2:33:00:: in pure|pure%3:00:02:: joy|joy%1:12:00:: at being|be%2:42:04:: in the 
country|country%1:15:00:: again, while Toto ran|run%2:38:00:: around them and chased|chase%2:38:00:: the moths|moth%1:05:00:: and 
butterflies, barking|bark%2:32:01:: merrily|merrily%4:02:00:: all the time. 
 
"City life|life%1:26:01:: does|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: agree|agree%2:32:00:: with me at all," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion, as they 
walked|walk%2:38:00:: along|along%4:02:01:: at a brisk|brisk%3:00:00:energetic:00 pace. "I have|have%2:40:00:: lost|lose%2:40:02:: much|much%3:00:00:: flesh|flesh%1:08:02:: since I lived|live%2:42:08:: 
there, and now|now%4:02:05:: I am|be%2:42:04:: anxious|anxious%3:00:00:eager:00 for a chance|chance%1:26:00:: to show|show%2:39:02:: the other|other%3:00:00:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: how 
courageous|courageous%3:00:04:: I have|have%2:40:00:: grown." 
 
 
 
They now|now%4:02:05:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: and took|take%2:39:00:: a last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 look|look%1:04:00:: at the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City. All they 
could see|see%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: a mass|mass%1:14:02:: of towers|tower%1:06:00:: and steeples|steeple%1:06:00:: behind the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 walls, 
and high|high%3:00:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: above everything the spires|spire%1:06:00:: and dome|dome%1:06:00:: of the Palace|palace%1:06:01:: of Oz.|oz.%1:23:00:: 
 
"Oz was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard, after all," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, as 
he felt|feel%2:39:00:: his heart|heart%1:08:00:: rattling|rattle%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:04:: in his breast. 
 
"He knew|know%2:31:03:: how to give|give%2:40:03:: me brains, and very|very%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: brains, too," said|say%2:32:00:: the 
Scarecrow. 
 
"If Oz had|have%2:40:00:: taken|take%2:39:00:: a dose|dose%1:06:00:: of the same|same%3:00:02:: courage|courage%1:07:00:: he gave|give%2:40:03:: me," added|add%2:32:01:: the 
Lion, "he would have|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: a brave|brave%2:42:00:: man." 
 
Dorothy said|say%2:32:00:: nothing. Oz had|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: kept|keep%2:41:03:: the promise|promise%1:10:00:: he made|make%2:36:00:: her, but he 
had|have%2:40:00:: done|do%2:41:01:: his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was|be%2:42:03:: a good|good%3:00:01:: man, 
even|even%4:02:01:: if he was|be%2:42:03:: a bad|bad%3:00:00:: Wizard. 
 
The first|first%3:00:00:: day's journey|journey%1:04:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: through the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 fields|field%1:17:00:: and bright|bright%3:00:02:: 
flowers|flower%1:20:00:: that stretched|stretch%2:42:00:: about the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City|city%1:15:00:: on every side. They 
slept|sleep%2:29:00:: that night|night%1:28:00:: on the grass, with nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: but the stars|star%1:17:01:: over them; 
and they rested|rest%2:32:00:: very|very%4:02:00:: well|well%4:02:00:: indeed. 
 
In the morning|morning%1:28:00:: they travelled|travel%2:38:00:: on|on%4:02:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to a thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 wood. There 
was|be%2:42:00:: no way|way%1:04:01:: of going|go%2:38:00:: around|around%4:02:05:: it, for it seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to extend|extend%2:42:01:: to the right|right%1:15:00:: and 
left|leave%2:31:05:: as|as%4:02:00:: far|far%4:02:04:: as they could see; and, besides, they did|do%2:42:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: dare|dare%2:41:00:: change|change%1:04:00:: 
the direction|direction%1:15:00:: of their journey|journey%1:04:00:: for fear|fear%1:12:00:: of getting|get%2:30:00:: lost. So they looked|look%2:39:00:: 
for the place|place%1:15:00:: where it would be|be%2:42:03:: easiest|easy%3:00:01:: to get|get%2:38:00:: into the forest. 
 
The Scarecrow, who was|be%2:42:03:: in the lead, finally|finally%4:02:00:: discovered|discover%2:39:03:: a big|big%3:00:01:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: 
with such|such%3:00:00:much:00 wide|wide%3:00:00:: spreading-branches that there was|be%2:42:03:: room|room%1:23:00:: for the party|party%1:14:00:: 
to pass|pass%2:38:00:: underneath. So he walked|walk%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: to the tree, but just|just%4:02:05:: as he 
came|come%2:38:00:: under the first|first%3:00:00:: branches|branch%1:20:00:: they bent|bent%3:00:00:damaged:00 down and twined|twin%2:35:00:: around him, 
and the next|next%3:00:00:succeeding:00 minute|minute%1:28:00:: he was|be%2:42:03:: raised|raise%2:38:00:: from the ground|ground%1:17:00:: and flung headlong|headlong%4:02:00:: 
among his fellow travellers. 
 
This did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:37:00:: the Scarecrow, but it surprised|surprise%2:31:00:: him, and he looked|look%2:39:01:: 
rather|rather%4:02:04:: dizzy|dizzy%3:00:00:ill:01 when Dorothy picked|pick%2:35:01:: him up. 
 
"Here is|be%2:42:04:: another space|space%1:15:00:: between the trees," called|call%2:32:09:: the Lion. 
 
 
 
"Let me try|try%2:41:00:: it first," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: me to 
get|get%2:30:00:: thrown|throw%2:35:00:: about." He walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to another tree, as he spoke, but its 
branches|branch%1:17:01:: immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: seized|seize%2:35:00:: him and tossed|toss%2:35:04:: him back|back%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: strange," exclaimed Dorothy; "what shall we do?" 
 
"The trees|tree%1:20:00:: seem|seem%2:39:00:: to have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:42:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: us, and stop|stop%2:41:00:: our 
journey," remarked|remark%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"I believe|believe%2:31:03:: I will try|try%2:41:00:: it myself," said|say%2:32:00:: the Woodman, and shouldering|shoulder%2:35:02:: 
his axe|axe%1:06:00:: he marched|march%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the first|first%3:00:00:: tree|tree%1:20:00:: that had|have%2:40:00:: handled|handle%2:35:01:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: so roughly. When a big|big%3:00:01:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: bent|bent%1:20:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to seize|seize%2:35:00:: him the 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:03:: at it so|so%4:02:02:: fiercely|fiercely%4:02:00:: that he cut|cut%2:35:00:: it in two. At once|once%4:02:02:: 
the tree|tree%1:20:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: shaking|shake%2:38:00:: all its branches|branch%1:20:00:: as if in pain, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: under it. 
 
"Come on!" he shouted|shout%2:32:00:: to the others; "be quick!" 
 
They all ran|run%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: and passed|pass%2:38:00:: under the tree|tree%1:20:00:: without injury, except 
Toto, who was|be%2:42:03:: caught|catch%2:35:06:: by a small|small%3:00:00:: branch|branch%1:20:00:: and shaken|shake%2:38:00:: until he howled. But 
the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: promptly|promptly%4:02:01:: chopped|chop%2:35:01:: off|off%4:02:04:: the branch|branch%1:20:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: the little|little%3:00:01:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: free. 
 
The other|other%3:00:00:: trees|tree%1:20:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: to keep|keep%2:42:00:: them back, so they 
made|make%2:30:15:: up|up%4:02:00:: their minds|mind%1:09:04:: that only|only%4:02:01:: the first|first%3:00:00:: row|row%1:14:00:: of trees|tree%1:20:00:: could bend|bend%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
their branches, and that probably|probably%4:02:00:: these were|be%2:42:06:: the policemen|policeman%1:18:00:: of the 
forest, and given|give%2:40:03:: this wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 power|power%1:07:00:: in order|order%1:26:02:: to keep|keep%2:41:01:: strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: 
of it. 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: with ease|ease%1:07:00:: through the trees|tree%1:20:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: 
to the further|further%3:00:00:far:00 edge|edge%1:15:00:: of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found|find%2:40:02:: 
before them a high|high%3:00:01:: wall, which seemed|seem%2:39:00:: to be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:42:05:: of white|white%3:00:01:: china. It was|be%2:42:06:: 
smooth, like the surface|surface%1:06:00:: of a dish, and higher|high%3:00:01:: than their heads. 
 
"What shall we do|do%2:41:01:: now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"I will make|make%2:36:00:: a ladder," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, "for we certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: must 
climb|climb%1:04:00:: over the wall." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XX. 
 
 
While the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: was|be%2:42:03:: making|make%2:36:01:: a ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: from wood|wood%1:27:00:: which he found|find%2:40:02:: in the 
forest|forest%1:17:00:: Dorothy lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and slept, for she was|be%2:42:03:: tired|tire%2:29:01:: by the long|long%3:00:02:: walk. 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: also|also%4:02:00:: curled|curl%2:30:00:: himself up|up%4:02:00:: to sleep|sleep%2:29:00:: and Toto lay|lay%2:35:00:: beside him. 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: watched|watch%2:39:00:: the Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: while he worked, and said|say%2:32:00:: to him: 
 
"I cannot think|think%2:31:00:: why this wall|wall%1:06:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: here, nor what it is|be%2:42:06:: made|make%2:42:05:: of." 
 
"Rest your brains|brain%1:09:01:: and do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: worry|worry%2:37:12:: about the wall," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the 
Woodman; "when we have|have%2:40:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: over it we shall know|know%2:31:01:: what is|be%2:42:05:: on the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side." 
 
After a time|time%1:28:05:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: finished. It looked|look%2:39:01:: clumsy, but the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: it was|be%2:42:03:: strong|strong%3:00:00:: and would answer|answer%2:32:00:: their purpose. The 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: waked|wake%2:29:02:: Dorothy and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and Toto, and told|tell%2:32:04:: them that the 
ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: ready. The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: first, but he 
was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: awkward|awkward%3:00:00:inconvenient:00 that Dorothy had|have%2:40:00:: to follow|follow%2:38:00:: close|close%4:02:01:: behind|behind%4:02:00:: and keep|keep%2:42:00:: him 
from falling|fall%2:38:03:: off. When he got|get%2:30:02:: his head|head%1:08:00:: over the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: said, 
 
"Oh, my!" 
 
"Go on," exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy. 
 
So the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: further|far%4:02:04:: up and sat|sit%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the 
wall, and Dorothy put|put%2:35:00:: her head|head%1:08:00:: over and cried, 
 
"Oh, my!" just|just%4:02:05:: as the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: done. 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: Toto came|come%2:38:00:: up, and immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: began|begin%2:30:00:: to bark, but Dorothy made|make%2:36:12:: 
him be|be%2:42:03:: still. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: climbed|climb%2:38:00:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: next, and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: last; but 
both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as they looked|look%2:39:00:: over the wall. 
When they were|be%2:42:05:: all sitting|sit%2:35:00:: in a row|row%1:14:00:: on the top|top%1:15:00:: of the wall|wall%1:06:00:: they 
looked|look%2:39:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: a strange|strange%3:00:00:: sight. 
 
 
 
Before them was|be%2:42:05:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 stretch|stretch%1:17:00:: of country|country%1:15:01:: having|have%2:42:00:: a floor|floor%1:06:00:: as smooth|smooth%1:04:00:: 
and shining|shin%2:38:00:: and white|white%3:00:01:: as the bottom|bottom%1:15:00:: of a big|big%3:00:01:: platter. Scattered|scatter%2:35:00:: 
around were|be%2:42:04:: many|many%3:00:00:: houses|house%1:06:00:: made|make%2:42:05:: entirely|entirely%4:02:00:: of china|china%1:06:00:: and painted|paint%2:35:00:: in the 
brightest|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 colours. These houses|house%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: small, the biggest|big%3:00:01:: of them 
reaching|reach%2:42:00:: only|only%4:02:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: high|high%3:00:01:: as Dorothy's waist. There were|be%2:42:03:: also|also%4:02:00:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: 
little|little%3:00:01:: barns, with china|china%1:06:00:: fences|fence%1:06:00:: around them, and many|many%3:00:00:: cows|cow%1:05:01:: and sheep|sheep%1:05:00:: 
and horses|horse%1:05:00:: and pigs|pig%1:05:00:: and chickens, all made|make%2:42:05:: of china, were|be%2:42:04:: standing|stand%2:35:00:: 
about in groups. 
 
But the strangest|strange%3:00:00:: of all were|be%2:42:06:: the people|people%1:14:00:: who lived|live%2:42:08:: in this queer|queer%1:18:00:: 
country. There were|be%2:42:03:: milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored 
bodices|bodice%1:06:00:: and golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:07:01:: all over their gowns; and princesses|princess%1:18:00:: with 
most|most%4:02:01:: gorgeous|gorgeous%3:00:00:beautiful:00 frocks|frock%1:06:00:: of silver|silver%1:27:00:: and gold|gold%1:27:00:: and purple; and shepherds|shepherd%1:18:00:: 
dressed|dress%2:29:01:: in knee-breeches with pink|pink%1:07:00:: and yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and blue|blue%3:00:00:chromatic:00 stripes|stripe%1:06:00:: down 
them, and golden|golden%3:00:00:metallic:00 buckles|buckle%1:06:00:: on their shoes; and princes|prince%1:18:00:: with jewelled|jewel%2:36:00:: 
crowns|crown%1:06:01:: upon their heads, wearing|wear%2:29:00:: ermine|ermine%1:27:00:: robes|robe%1:06:01:: and satin doublets; and 
funny|funny%3:00:00:humorous:00 clowns|clown%1:18:00:: in ruffled|ruffle%2:37:01:: gowns, with round|round%3:00:00:: red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 spots|spot%1:15:01:: upon their cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: 
and tall, pointed|point%2:32:00:: caps. And, strangest of all, these people|people%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all 
made|make%2:42:05:: of china, even|even%4:02:00:: to their clothes, and were|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: small|small%3:00:00:: that the 
tallest|tall%3:00:00:: of them was|be%2:42:03:: no|no%4:02:02:: higher|high%3:00:01:: than Dorothy's knee. 
 
No one|one%1:23:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: so|so%4:02:07:: much|much%3:00:00:: as look|look%1:07:01:: at the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: at first, except one 
little|little%3:00:01:: purple|purple%3:00:00:chromatic:00 china|china%1:06:00:: dog|dog%1:05:00:: with an extra-large head, which came|come%2:38:00:: to the 
wall|wall%1:06:00:: and barked|bark%2:32:01:: at them in a tiny|tiny%3:00:00:small:00 voice, afterwards|afterwards%4:02:00:: running|run%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: again. 
 
"How shall we get|get%2:38:00:: down?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
They found|find%2:39:02:: the ladder|ladder%1:06:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: they could not|not%4:02:00:: pull|pull%2:35:00:: it up, so the 
Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: fell|fall%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:03:: the wall|wall%1:06:00:: and the others jumped|jump%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: upon him so|so%4:02:09:: 
that the hard|hard%3:00:01:: floor|floor%1:06:00:: would not|not%4:02:00:: hurt|hurt%2:29:01:: their feet. Of course|course%1:15:00:: they took|take%2:31:03:: 
pains|pain%1:18:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: to light|light%2:38:00:: on his head|head%1:08:00:: and get|get%2:30:02:: the pins|pin%1:06:00:: in their feet. When 
all were|be%2:42:03:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: down they picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the Scarecrow, whose body|body%1:08:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: 
quite|quite%4:02:01:: flattened|flatten%2:30:00:: out, and patted|pat%2:35:00:: his straw|straw%1:27:00:: into shape|shape%1:07:00:: again. 
 
"We must cross|cross%2:38:00:: this strange|strange%3:00:00:: place|place%1:15:00:: in order|order%1:07:00:: to get|get%2:38:00:: to the other|other%3:00:00:: side," 
said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy; "for it would be|be%2:42:03:: unwise|unwise%3:00:00:foolish:00 for us to go|go%2:41:00:: any other|other%3:00:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: 
except due|due%3:00:02:: South." 
 
They began|begin%2:30:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: through the country|country%1:15:02:: of the china|china%1:06:00:: people, and the 
first|first%3:00:00:: thing|thing%1:04:00:: they came|come%2:38:04:: to was|be%2:42:06:: a china|china%1:06:00:: milk-maid milking|milk%2:30:00:: a china|china%1:06:00:: cow. 
As they drew|draw%2:38:02:: near the cow|cow%1:05:01:: suddenly|suddenly%4:02:02:: gave|give%2:41:00:: a kick|kick%1:04:00:: and kicked|kick%2:38:00:: over the 
stool, the pail, and even|even%4:02:00:: the milk-maid herself, all falling|fall%2:38:00:: on the 
china|china%1:06:00:: ground|ground%1:27:00:: with a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 clatter. 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: shocked|shock%2:37:02:: to see|see%2:31:01:: that the cow|cow%1:05:01:: had|have%2:30:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg|leg%1:08:01:: short|short%3:00:01:: off, 
and that the pail|pail%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:42:00:: in several|several%3:00:00:some:00 small|small%3:00:00:: pieces, while the poor|poor%3:00:00:: 
milk-maid had|have%2:40:00:: a nick|nick%1:07:00:: in her left|left%3:00:00:: elbow. 
 
"There!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the milk-maid, angrily; "see what you have|have%2:40:00:: done! My 
cow|cow%1:05:01:: has|have%2:42:00:: broken|break%2:29:04:: her leg, and I must take|take%2:38:09:: her to the mender's shop|shop%1:06:00:: 
and have|have%2:30:00:: it glued|glue%2:35:00:: on again. What do|do%2:36:00:: you mean|mean%2:32:01:: by coming|come%2:38:04:: here|here%4:02:01:: and 
frightening|frightening%3:00:00:alarming:00 my cow?" 
 
"I'm very|very%3:00:00:precise:00 sorry," returned|return%2:32:01:: Dorothy; "please forgive|forgive%2:32:00:: us." 
 
But the pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: milk-maid was|be%2:42:03:: much|much%4:02:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: vexed|vex%2:31:02:: to make|make%2:41:00:: any answer. She 
picked|pick%2:35:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the leg|leg%1:08:02:: sulkily|sulkily%4:02:00:: and led|lead%2:38:01:: her cow|cow%1:05:01:: away, the poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 animal|animal%1:03:00:: 
limping|limp%2:38:00:: on three legs. As she left|leave%2:31:05:: them the milk-maid cast|cast%1:06:00:: many|many%3:00:00:: 
reproachful|reproachful%3:00:00:unfavorable:02 glances|glance%1:04:00:: over her shoulder|shoulder%1:08:00:: at the clumsy|clumsy%3:00:00:awkward:00 strangers, 
holding|hold%2:35:00:: her nicked|nick%2:35:01:: elbow|elbow%1:08:00:: close|close%3:00:05:: to her side. 
 
 
 
Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: grieved|grieve%2:37:00:: at this mishap. 
 
"We must be|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:01:: careful|careful%3:00:00:: here," said|say%2:32:00:: the kind-hearted|kind-hearted%3:00:00:kind:00 Woodman, "or we 
may hurt|hurt%2:37:01:: these pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: so they will never|never%4:02:00:: get|get%2:30:00:: over it." 
 
A little|little%3:00:01:: farther|far%4:02:00:: on Dorothy met|meet%2:38:01:: a most|most%4:02:01:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: young|young%3:00:00:: 
princess, who stopped|stop%2:42:00:: short|short%4:02:04:: as she saw|saw%2:35:00:: the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: and started|start%2:38:04:: to 
run|run%2:38:04:: away. 
 
Dorothy wanted|want%2:37:00:: to see|see%2:39:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: of the Princess, so she ran|run%2:38:00:: after her; but 
the china|china%1:06:00:: girl|girl%1:18:00:: cried|cry%2:32:01:: out, 
 
"Don't chase me! don't chase me!" 
 
She had|have%2:40:00:: such|such%3:00:00:much:00 a frightened|frightened%3:00:00:afraid:00 little|little%3:00:01:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: that Dorothy stopped|stop%2:38:00:: and said, 
 
"Why not?" 
 
"Because," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the princess, also|also%4:02:00:: stopping, a safe|safe%3:00:01:: distance|distance%1:07:00:: 
away, "if I run|run%2:38:00:: I may fall|fall%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and break|break%2:29:04:: myself." 
 
"But couldn't you be|be%2:42:03:: mended?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the girl. 
 
"Oh, yes; but one is|be%2:42:03:: never|never%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: after being|be%2:42:03:: mended, you know," 
replied|reply%2:32:00:: the princess. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: not," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"Now there is|be%2:42:04:: Mr.|mr.%1:10:00:: Joker, one of our clowns," continued|continue%2:32:00:: the china|china%1:06:00:: 
lady, "who is|be%2:42:03:: always|always%4:02:00:: trying|try%2:41:00:: to stand|stand%2:35:00:: upon his head. He has|have%2:40:00:: broken|break%2:41:00:: 
himself so|so%4:02:02:: often|often%4:02:00:: that he is|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in a hundred places, and doesn't 
look|look%2:39:01:: at all pretty. Here|here%4:02:00:: he comes|come%2:38:00:: now, so you can see|see%2:39:00:: for yourself." 
 
Indeed, a jolly|jolly%4:02:00:: little|little%3:00:01:: Clown|clown%1:18:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: came|come%2:38:00:: walking|walk%2:38:00:: toward them, and 
Dorothy could see|see%2:39:00:: that in spite|spite%1:12:00:: of his pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 clothes|clothes%1:06:00:: of red|red%1:07:00:: and 
yellow|yellow%3:00:00:chromatic:00 and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 he was|be%2:42:03:: completely|completely%4:02:03:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with cracks, running|run%2:38:01:: every 
which way|way%1:07:01:: and showing|show%2:39:00:: plainly|plainly%4:02:00:: that he had|have%2:40:01:: been|be%2:42:03:: mended|mend%2:30:00:: in many|many%3:00:00:: places. 
 
The Clown|clown%1:18:01:: put|put%2:35:05:: his hands|hand%1:08:00:: in his pockets, and after puffing|puff%2:30:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: his 
cheeks|cheek%1:08:00:: and nodding|nod%2:32:00:: his head|head%1:08:00:: at them saucily|saucily%4:02:01:: he said, 
 
"My lady|lady%1:18:02:: fair, 
Why do|do%2:36:01:: you stare|stare%2:39:00:: 
At poor|poor%3:00:00:unfortunate:00 old|old%3:00:02:: Mr.|mr.%1:10:00:: Joker? 
You're quite|quite%4:02:01:: as stiff|stiff%1:18:00:: 
And prim|prim%3:00:00:refined:01 as if 
You'd eaten|eat%2:34:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: a poker!" 
 
"Be quiet, sir!" said|say%2:32:00:: the princess; "can't you see|see%2:39:00:: these are|be%2:42:03:: 
strangers, and should be|be%2:42:03:: treated|treat%2:41:00:: with respect?" 
 
"Well, that's respect, I expect," declared|declare%2:32:00:: the Clown, and immediately|immediately%4:02:00:: 
stood|stand%2:35:00:: upon his head. 
 
"Don't mind|mind%1:09:00:: Mr.|mr.%1:10:00:: Joker," said|say%2:32:00:: the princess|princess%1:18:00:: to Dorothy; "he is|be%2:42:06:: 
considerably|considerably%4:02:01:: cracked|crack%2:30:05:: in his head, and that makes|make%2:30:00:: him foolish." 
 
 
 
"Oh, I don't mind|mind%2:32:00:: him a bit," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. "But you are|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: 
beautiful," she continued, "that I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I could love|love%2:37:00:: you dearly. 
Won't you let|let%2:41:00:: me carry|carry%2:35:02:: you back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: and stand|stand%2:35:00:: you on Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em's 
mantle-shelf? I could carry|carry%2:35:02:: you in my basket." 
 
"That would make|make%2:30:00:: me very|very%4:02:00:: unhappy," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the china|china%1:06:00:: princess. "You 
see, here|here%4:02:00:: in our own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 country|country%1:14:01:: we live|live%2:42:08:: contentedly, and can talk|talk%2:32:01:: and 
move|move%2:38:01:: around|around%4:02:04:: as we please. But whenever any of us are|be%2:42:03:: taken|take%2:38:09:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
our joints|joint%1:08:00:: at once|once%4:02:00:: stiffen, and we can only|only%4:02:02:: stand|stand%2:35:00:: straight|straight%4:02:05:: and look|look%2:39:00:: 
pretty. Of course|course%1:14:00:: that is|be%2:42:06:: all that is|be%2:42:03:: expected|expect%2:32:00:: of us when we are|be%2:42:03:: on 
mantle-shelves and cabinets|cabinet%1:06:00:: and drawing-room tables, but our lives|life%1:26:02:: 
are|be%2:42:03:: much|much%3:00:00:: pleasanter here|here%4:02:00:: in our own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 country." 
 
"I would not|not%4:02:00:: make|make%2:30:00:: you unhappy|unhappy%3:00:04:: for all the world!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy; 
"so I'll just|just%4:02:00:: say|say%2:32:00:: good-bye." 
 
"Good-bye," replied|reply%2:32:00:: the princess. 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: through the china|china%1:06:00:: country. The little|little%3:00:01:: animals|animal%1:03:00:: 
and all the people|people%1:14:00:: scampered|scamper%2:38:00:: out of their way, fearing|fear%2:37:00:: the strangers|stranger%1:18:00:: 
would break|break%2:30:03:: them, and after an hour|hour%1:28:00:: or so|so%4:02:05:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: the 
other|other%3:00:00:: side|side%1:15:02:: of the country|country%1:15:01:: and came|come%2:38:00:: to another china|china%1:06:00:: wall. 
 
It was|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: high|high%3:00:01:: as the first, however, and by standing|stand%2:35:00:: upon the 
Lion's back|back%2:38:01:: they all managed|manage%2:41:09:: to scramble|scramble%2:38:01:: to the top. Then|then%4:02:00:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
gathered|gather%2:35:00:: his legs|leg%1:08:01:: under him and jumped|jump%2:38:00:: on the wall; but just|just%4:02:05:: as he 
jumped|jump%2:33:00:: he upset|upset%2:38:00:: a china|china%1:06:00:: church|church%1:06:00:: with his tail|tail%1:05:00:: and smashed|smash%2:30:00:: it all to 
pieces. 
 
"That was|be%2:42:03:: too|too%4:02:00:: bad," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "but really|really%4:02:03:: I think|think%2:31:01:: we were|be%2:42:03:: lucky|lucky%3:00:00:fortunate:00 
in not|not%4:02:00:: doing|do%2:36:02:: these little|little%3:00:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: more|more%3:00:01:: harm|harm%1:26:00:: than breaking|break%2:29:04:: a cow's leg|leg%1:08:01:: 
and a church. They are|be%2:42:03:: all so brittle!" 
 
"They are, indeed," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "and I am|be%2:42:03:: thankful|thankful%3:00:00:: I am|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:36:00:: 
of straw|straw%1:27:00:: and cannot be|be%2:42:03:: easily|easily%4:02:01:: damaged. There are|be%2:42:00:: worse|bad%3:00:00:: things|thing%1:06:01:: in the 
world|world%1:14:01:: than being|be%2:42:06:: a Scarecrow." 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XXI. 
 
 
After climbing|climb%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from the china|china%1:06:00:: wall|wall%1:06:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: 
themselves in a disagreeable|disagreeable%3:00:00:: country, full|full%3:00:00:: of bogs|bog%1:17:00:: and marshes|marsh%1:17:00:: and 
covered|cover%2:29:15:: with tall, rank|rank%3:00:00:abundant:00 grass. It was|be%2:42:03:: difficult|difficult%3:00:00:: to walk|walk%2:38:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: without 
falling|fall%2:38:03:: into muddy|muddy%3:00:00:wet:01 holes, for the grass|grass%1:20:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: thick|thick%3:00:00:concentrated:00 that it hid|hide%2:39:00:: them 
from sight. However, by carefully|carefully%4:02:00:: picking|pick%2:31:00:: their way, they got|get%2:38:00:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: 
along until they reached|reach%2:38:01:: solid|solid%3:00:00:unbroken:02 ground. But here|here%4:02:00:: the country|country%1:15:01:: seemed|seem%2:39:00:: 
wilder|wild%3:00:02:: than ever, and after a long|long%3:00:02:: and tiresome|tiresome%3:00:00:uninteresting:00 walk|walk%1:04:00:: through the 
underbrush they entered|enter%2:38:00:: another forest, where the trees|tree%1:20:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: bigger|big%3:00:01:: 
and older|old%3:00:02:: than any they had|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: seen. 
 
"This forest|forest%1:14:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: perfectly|perfectly%4:02:00:: delightful," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Lion, looking|look%2:39:01:: 
around him with joy; "never have|have%2:40:00:: I seen|see%2:39:00:: a more|more%4:02:00:: beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: place." 
 
"It seems|seem%2:39:00:: gloomy," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"Not a bit|bit%1:23:01:: of it," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the Lion; "I should like|like%2:37:01:: to live|live%2:42:08:: here|here%4:02:00:: all 
my life. See|see%1:15:00:: how soft|soft%3:00:01:: the dried|dry%2:30:00:: leaves|leaf%1:20:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: under your feet|foot%1:08:01:: and how 
rich|rich%3:00:02:: and green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 the moss|moss%1:20:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: that clings|cling%1:13:00:: to these old|old%3:00:01:: trees. Surely|surely%4:02:00:: no 
wild|wild%3:00:01:: beast|beast%1:03:00:: could wish|wish%2:37:00:: a pleasanter|pleasant%3:00:00:: home." 
 
"Perhaps there are|be%2:42:04:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: beasts|beast%1:03:00:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: now," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy. 
 
"I suppose|suppose%2:31:00:: there are," returned|return%2:32:01:: the Lion; "but I do|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: see|see%2:39:00:: any of 
them about." 
 
They walked|walk%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: until it became|become%2:30:00:: too|too%4:02:00:: dark|dark%3:00:01:: to go|go%2:38:00:: any 
farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: lay|lay%2:35:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to sleep, while the 
Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: kept|keep%2:42:00:: watch|watch%1:04:00:: over them as usual. 
 
When morning|morning%1:28:00:: came|come%2:30:01:: they started|start%2:30:00:: again. Before they had|have%2:40:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: far|far%4:02:00:: they 
heard|hear%2:39:00:: a low|low%3:00:00:soft:04 rumble, as of the growling|growling%1:10:00:: of many|many%3:00:00:: wild|wild%3:00:01:: animals. Toto 
whimpered|whimper%2:29:00:: a little|little%3:00:01:: but none|none%1:28:00:: of the others was|be%2:42:03:: frightened|frighten%2:37:00:: and they kept|keep%2:42:07:: 
along the well-trodden path|path%1:06:00:: until they came|come%2:38:04:: to an opening|opening%1:17:00:: in the wood, 
in which were|be%2:42:04:: gathered|gather%2:35:00:: hundreds|hundred%1:23:00:: of beasts|beast%1:03:00:: of every variety. There were|be%2:42:03:: 
tigers|tiger%1:05:00:: and elephants|elephant%1:05:00:: and bears|bear%1:05:00:: and wolves|wolf%1:05:00:: and foxes|fox%1:05:00:: and all the others 
in the natural|natural%3:00:02:: history, and for a moment|moment%1:28:01:: Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: afraid. But the 
Lion|lion%1:05:00:: explained|explain%2:32:00:: that the animals|animal%1:03:00:: were|be%2:42:05:: holding|hold%2:36:00:: a meeting, and he judged|judge%2:31:01:: 
by their snarling|snarl%2:32:01:: and growling|growl%2:32:00:: that they were|be%2:42:03:: in great|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 trouble. 
 
As he spoke|speak%2:32:01:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 of the beasts|beast%1:03:00:: caught|catch%2:35:07:: sight|sight%1:09:01:: of him, and at once|once%4:02:02:: 
the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 assemblage|assemblage%1:14:01:: hushed|hush%2:30:01:: as if by magic. The biggest|big%3:00:01:: of the tigers|tiger%1:05:00:: 
came|come%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and bowed, saying, 
 
 
 
"Welcome, O|o%1:10:00:: King|king%1:18:00:: of Beasts! You have|have%2:40:00:: come|come%2:38:04:: in good|good%3:00:01:: time|time%1:28:05:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: our 
enemy|enemy%1:18:01:: and bring|bring%2:38:00:: peace|peace%1:26:01:: to all the animals|animal%1:03:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: once more." 
 
"What is|be%2:42:06:: your trouble?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion, quietly. 
 
"We are|be%2:42:03:: all threatened," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the tiger, "by a fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: which 
has|have%2:40:00:: lately|lately%4:02:00:: come|come%2:38:00:: into this forest. It is|be%2:42:03:: a most|most%4:02:01:: tremendous|tremendous%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 monster, like 
a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spider, with a body|body%1:08:01:: as|as%4:02:00:: big|big%3:00:01:: as an elephant|elephant%1:05:00:: and legs|leg%1:08:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as 
a tree|tree%1:20:00:: trunk. It has|have%2:40:00:: eight of these long|long%3:00:01:: legs, and as the monster|monster%1:18:02:: 
crawls|crawl%2:38:00:: through the forest|forest%1:14:00:: he seizes|seize%2:35:00:: an animal|animal%1:03:00:: with a leg|leg%1:08:02:: and drags|drag%2:35:00:: it 
to his mouth, where he eats|eat%2:34:02:: it as a spider|spider%1:05:00:: does|do%2:41:01:: a fly. Not|not%4:02:00:: one of us is|be%2:42:03:: 
safe|safe%3:00:01:: while this fierce|fierce%3:00:00:violent:00 creature|creature%1:03:00:: is|be%2:42:03:: alive, and we had|have%2:40:00:: called|call%2:41:04:: a meeting|meeting%1:14:00:: 
to decide|decide%2:31:00:: how to take|take%2:41:04:: care|care%1:04:02:: of ourselves when you came|come%2:38:04:: among us." 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: thought|think%2:31:00:: for a moment. 
 
"Are there any other|other%3:00:00:: lions|lion%1:05:00:: in this forest?" he asked. 
 
"No; there were|be%2:42:00:: some, but the monster|monster%1:18:02:: has|have%2:40:00:: eaten|eat%2:34:00:: them all. And, 
besides, they were|be%2:42:03:: none|none%1:28:00:: of them nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: so|so%4:02:02:: large|large%3:00:00:: and brave|brave%2:42:00:: as you." 
 
"If I put|put%2:35:05:: an end|end%1:28:00:: to your enemy|enemy%1:14:00:: will you bow|bow%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to me and obey|obey%2:41:00:: me as 
King|king%1:18:00:: of the Forest?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"We will do|do%2:41:01:: that gladly," returned|return%2:32:01:: the tiger; and all the other|other%3:00:00:: 
beasts|beast%1:03:00:: roared|roar%2:32:03:: with a mighty|mighty%3:00:00:powerful:00 roar: "We will!" 
 
"Where is|be%2:42:05:: this great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spider|spider%1:05:00:: of yours now?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Lion. 
 
"Yonder, among the oak|oak%1:20:00:: trees," said|say%2:32:00:: the tiger, pointing|point%2:32:00:: with his 
fore-foot. 
 
"Take good|good%3:00:01:: care|care%1:04:02:: of these friends|friend%1:18:00:: of mine," said|say%2:32:00:: the Lion, "and I will 
go|go%2:38:00:: at once|once%4:02:00:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: the monster." 
 
He bade|bid%2:32:01:: his comrades|comrade%1:18:00:: good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: and marched|march%2:38:00:: proudly|proudly%4:02:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: battle|battle%1:04:00:: 
with the enemy. 
 
The great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spider|spider%1:05:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: lying|lie%2:35:00:: asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: when the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: found|find%2:40:00:: him, and it 
looked|look%2:39:01:: so|so%4:02:02:: ugly|ugly%3:00:00:: that its foe|foe%1:18:00:: turned|turn%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: his nose|nose%1:08:00:: in disgust. Its legs|leg%1:08:02:: 
were|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: as|as%4:02:00:: long|long%4:02:00:: as the tiger|tiger%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: said, and it's body|body%1:08:01:: covered|cover%2:35:00:: with 
coarse|coarse%3:00:00:: black|black%3:00:01:: hair. It had|have%2:40:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 mouth, with a row|row%1:14:00:: of sharp|sharp%3:00:00:: teeth|teeth%1:08:00:: 
a foot|foot%1:23:00:: long; but its head|head%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: joined|join%2:35:01:: to the pudgy|pudgy%3:00:00:fat:01 body|body%1:08:01:: by a neck|neck%1:08:00:: as 
slender|slender%3:00:00:narrow:00 as a wasp's waist. This gave|give%2:40:03:: the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: a hint|hint%1:10:00:: of the best|best%3:00:00:: way|way%1:15:00:: 
to attack|attack%2:33:02:: the creature, and as he knew|know%2:31:02:: it was|be%2:42:03:: easier|easy%3:00:01:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: it 
asleep|asleep%4:02:00:: than awake, he gave|give%2:40:03:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 spring|spring%1:06:00:: and landed|land%2:38:00:: directly|directly%4:02:00:: upon 
the monster's back. Then, with one blow|blow%1:04:01:: of his heavy|heavy%3:00:01:: paw, all armed|arm%2:40:00:: 
with sharp|sharp%3:00:00:pointed:00 claws, he knocked|knock%2:35:04:: the spider's head|head%2:38:01:: from its body. Jumping|jump%2:38:00:: 
down, he watched|watch%2:39:00:: it until the long|long%3:00:01:: legs|leg%1:08:01:: stopped|stop%2:42:00:: wiggling, when he 
knew|know%2:31:01:: it was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:01:: dead. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the opening|opening%1:17:00:: where the beasts|beast%1:03:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: 
waiting|wait%2:42:00:: for him and said, proudly, "You need fear|fear%2:37:00:: your enemy|enemy%1:18:00:: no longer." 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the beasts|beast%1:03:00:: bowed|bow%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: to the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: as their King, and he promised|promise%2:32:00:: 
to come|come%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: and rule|rule%1:26:00:: over them as|as%4:02:00:: soon|soon%4:02:00:: as Dorothy was|be%2:42:03:: safely|safely%4:02:00:: on her 
way|way%1:15:00:: to Kansas. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XXII. 
 
 
The four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: passed|pass%2:38:00:: through the rest|rest%1:24:00:: of the forest|forest%1:14:00:: in safety, 
and when they came|come%2:38:00:: out|out%4:02:04:: from its gloom|gloom%1:26:01:: saw|saw%2:35:00:: before them a steep|steep%3:00:00:: hill, 
covered|cover%2:29:15:: from top|top%1:15:00:: to bottom|bottom%1:15:01:: with great|great%3:00:01:large:00 pieces|piece%1:06:00:: of rock. 
 
"That will be|be%2:42:03:: a hard|hard%3:00:06:: climb," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow, "but we must get|get%2:38:12:: 
over the hill, nevertheless." 
 
So|so%4:02:09:: he led|lead%2:38:01:: the way|way%1:15:00:: and the others followed. They had|have%2:40:00:: nearly|nearly%4:02:00:: reached|reach%2:38:01:: 
the first|first%3:00:00:: rock|rock%1:17:01:: when they heard|hear%2:39:00:: a rough|rough%3:00:00:: voice|voice%1:10:00:: cry|cry%1:10:00:: out, 
 
"Keep back!" 
 
"Who are|be%2:42:06:: you?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. Then|then%4:02:00:: a head|head%1:08:00:: showed|show%2:39:01:: itself over 
the rock|rock%1:17:01:: and the same|same%3:00:02:: voice|voice%1:07:00:: said, 
 
"This hill|hill%1:17:00:: belongs|belong%2:40:00:: to us, and we don't allow|allow%2:41:00:: anyone to cross|cross%2:38:00:: it." 
 
"But we must cross|cross%2:38:00:: it," said|say%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. "We're going|go%2:38:00:: to the 
country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings." 
 
"But you shall not!" replied|reply%2:32:00:: the voice, and there|there%4:02:00:: stepped|step%2:38:00:: from behind 
the rock|rock%1:17:01:: the strangest|strange%3:00:00:: man|man%1:18:00:: the travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: ever|ever%4:02:04:: seen. 
 
He was|be%2:42:03:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: short|short%3:00:03:: and stout|stout%1:13:00:: and had|have%2:40:00:: a big|big%3:00:01:: head, which was|be%2:42:03:: flat|flat%3:00:00:even:01 at the 
top|top%3:00:00:: and supported|support%2:35:00:: by a thick|thick%3:00:01:: neck|neck%1:08:00:: full|full%3:00:00:: of wrinkles. But he had|have%2:40:00:: no arms|arm%1:08:00:: 
at all, and, seeing|see%2:31:01:: this, the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: did|do%2:41:01:: not|not%4:02:00:: fear|fear%2:37:00:: that so|so%4:02:02:: helpless|helpless%3:00:00:dependent:00 a 
creature|creature%1:03:00:: could prevent|prevent%2:41:00:: them from climbing|climb%2:38:00:: the hill. So he said, 
 
"I'm sorry not|not%4:02:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: as you wish, but we must pass|pass%2:38:00:: over your hill|hill%1:17:00:: 
whether you like|like%2:37:05:: it or not," and he walked|walk%2:38:00:: boldly|boldly%4:02:00:: forward. 
 
As|as%4:02:00:: quick|quick%3:00:00:fast:01 as lightning|lightning%1:11:00:: the man's head|head%1:08:00:: shot|shoot%2:38:01:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: and his neck|neck%1:08:00:: 
stretched|stretch%2:30:04:: out|out%4:02:04:: until the top|top%1:15:01:: of the head, where it was|be%2:42:03:: flat, struck|strike%2:35:00:: 
the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: in the middle|middle%1:15:00:: and sent|send%2:38:01:: him tumbling, over and over, 
down the hill. Almost|almost%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: quickly|quickly%4:02:00:: as it came|come%2:30:01:: the head|head%1:08:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to the 
body, and the man|man%1:18:00:: laughed|laugh%2:29:00:: harshly|harshly%4:02:02:: as he said, 
 
"It isn't as|as%4:02:00:: easy|easy%3:00:01:: as you think!" 
 
A chorus|chorus%1:11:00:: of boisterous|boisterous%3:00:00:spirited:00 laughter|laughter%1:10:00:: came|come%2:38:00:: from the other|other%3:00:00:: rocks, and 
Dorothy saw|saw%2:35:00:: hundreds|hundred%1:23:00:: of the armless|armless%3:00:00:: Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, 
one behind every rock. 
 
The Lion|lion%1:05:00:: became|become%2:30:00:: quite|quite%4:02:02:: angry|angry%3:00:00:: at the laughter|laughter%1:04:00:: caused|cause%2:32:00:: by the Scarecrow's 
mishap, and giving|give%2:41:00:: a loud|loud%3:00:00:: roar|roar%1:10:00:: that echoed|echo%2:32:00:: like thunder|thunder%1:11:01:: he dashed|dash%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: 
the hill. 
 
Again|again%4:02:00:: a head|head%1:08:00:: shot|shot%1:04:06:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: out, and the great|great%3:00:01:large:00 Lion|lion%1:05:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: rolling|roll%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:02:: 
the hill|hill%1:17:00:: as if he had|have%2:40:00:: been|be%2:42:03:: struck|strike%2:35:01:: by a cannon|cannon%1:06:00:: ball. 
 
Dorothy ran|run%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: and helped|help%2:41:00:: the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: to his feet, and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: 
came|come%2:30:03:: up|up%4:02:00:: to her, feeling|feeling%1:09:03:: rather|rather%4:02:04:: bruised|bruise%2:35:00:: and sore, and said, 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: useless|useless%3:00:00:: to fight|fight%2:33:01:: people|people%1:14:00:: with shooting heads; no one|one%1:23:00:: can 
withstand|withstand%2:33:00:: them." 
 
"What can we do, then?" she asked. 
 
"Call the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys," suggested|suggest%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman; "you have|have%2:40:00:: still|still%4:02:04:: 
the right|right%1:07:00:: to command|command%2:32:01:: them once|once%4:02:00:: more." 
 
"Very well," she answered, and putting|put%2:35:00:: on the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: she uttered|utter%2:32:02:: 
the magic|magic%3:00:00:supernatural:00 words. The Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: as|as%4:02:00:: prompt|prompt%3:00:00:ready:00 as ever, and in a few|few%3:00:00:: 
moments|moment%1:28:02:: the entire|entire%3:00:01:whole:00 band|band%1:14:00:: stood|stand%2:35:00:: before her. 
 
"What are|be%2:42:06:: your commands?" enquired|enquire%2:32:00:: the King|king%1:18:00:: of the Monkeys, bowing|bow%2:32:00:: low. 
 
"Carry us over the hill|hill%1:17:00:: to the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings," answered|answer%2:32:00:: 
the girl. 
 
"It shall be|be%2:42:03:: done," said|say%2:32:00:: the King, and at once|once%4:02:02:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: 
caught|catch%2:35:06:: the four travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: and Toto up|up%4:02:00:: in their arms|arm%1:08:00:: and flew|fly%2:38:00:: away|away%4:02:00:: 
with them. As they passed|pass%2:38:00:: over the hill|hill%1:17:00:: the Hammer-Heads yelled|yell%2:32:01:: with 
vexation, and shot|shoot%2:41:00:: their heads|head%1:08:00:: high|high%3:00:01:: in the air; but they could not|not%4:02:00:: 
reach|reach%2:32:00:: the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys, which carried|carry%2:35:02:: Dorothy and her comrades|comrade%1:18:00:: 
safely|safely%4:02:00:: over the hill|hill%1:17:00:: and set|set%2:30:01:: them down|down%4:02:00:: in the beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: country|country%1:15:01:: of 
the Quadlings. 
 
"This is|be%2:42:06:: the last|last%3:00:00:: time|time%1:11:00:: you can summon|summon%2:32:05:: us," said|say%2:32:00:: the leader|leader%1:18:00:: to 
Dorothy; "so good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: and good|good%3:00:00:fortunate:00 luck|luck%1:26:00:: to you." 
 
"Good-bye, and thank|thank%2:32:00:: you very|very%4:02:00:: much," returned|return%2:32:01:: the girl; and the 
Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: rose|rise%2:38:00:: into the air|air%1:15:00:: and were|be%2:42:03:: out of sight|sight%1:09:02:: in a twinkling. 
 
The country|country%1:15:02:: of the Quadlings seemed|seem%2:39:00:: rich|rich%3:00:00:fruitful:00 and happy. There was|be%2:42:00:: field|field%1:14:00:: 
upon field|field%1:15:00:: of ripening|ripen%2:30:00:: grain, with well-paved roads|road%1:06:00:: running|run%2:42:00:: between, 
and pretty|pretty%4:02:00:: rippling|ripple%2:39:00:: brooks|brook%1:17:00:: with strong|strong%3:00:00:: bridges|bridge%1:06:00:: across them. The fences|fence%1:06:00:: 
and houses|house%1:06:00:: and bridges|bridge%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: all painted|painted%3:00:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 red, just|just%4:02:05:: as they had|have%2:40:00:: 
been|be%2:42:03:: painted|painted%3:00:00:: yellow|yellow%1:07:00:: in the country|country%1:15:02:: of the Winkies and blue|blue%1:07:00:: in the 
country|country%1:15:00:: of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were|be%2:42:03:: short|short%3:00:03:: and 
fat|fat%1:07:00:: and looked|look%2:39:01:: chubby|chubby%3:00:00:fat:01 and good|good%3:00:00:nice:00 natured, were|be%2:42:03:: dressed|dress%2:29:01:: all in red, which 
showed|show%2:39:00:: bright|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 against the green|green%3:00:00:chromatic:00 grass|grass%1:20:00:: and the yellowing grain. 
 
The Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: set|set%2:35:00:: them down|down%4:02:00:: near a farm|farm%1:06:00:: house, and the four 
travellers|traveller%1:18:00:: walked|walk%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: to it and knocked|knock%2:35:01:: at the door. It was|be%2:42:03:: opened|open%2:35:06:: by 
the farmer's wife, and when Dorothy asked|ask%2:32:01:: for something to eat|eat%2:34:00:: the 
woman|woman%1:18:00:: gave|give%2:36:02:: them all a good|good%3:00:01:: dinner, with three kinds|kind%1:09:00:: of cake|cake%1:13:00:: and four 
kinds|kind%1:09:00:: of cookies, and a bowl|bowl%1:06:00:: of milk|milk%1:13:01:: for Toto. 
 
"How far|far%4:02:04:: is|be%2:42:03:: it to the Castle|castle%1:06:02:: of Glinda?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the child. 
 
"It is|be%2:42:03:: not|not%4:02:00:: a great|great%3:00:01:large:00 way," answered|answer%2:32:00:: the farmer's wife. "Take the road|road%1:06:00:: 
to the South|south%1:15:01:: and you will soon|soon%4:02:00:: reach|reach%2:38:01:: it." 
 
Thanking|thank%2:32:00:: the good|good%3:00:01:: woman, they started|start%2:30:00:: afresh|afresh%4:02:00:: and walked|walk%2:38:00:: by the fields|field%1:15:00:: 
and across the pretty|pretty%3:00:00:beautiful:00 bridges|bridge%1:06:00:: until they saw|saw%2:35:00:: before them a very|very%4:02:00:: 
beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: Castle. Before the gates|gate%1:06:00:: were|be%2:42:04:: three young|young%3:00:00:: girls, dressed|dress%2:29:01:: 
in handsome|handsome%3:00:00:beautiful:00 red|red%3:00:01:chromatic:00 uniforms|uniform%1:06:00:: trimmed|trim%2:36:01:: with gold|gold%1:27:00:: braid; and as Dorothy 
approached|approach%2:38:00:: one of them said|say%2:32:00:: to her, 
 
"Why have|have%2:40:00:: you come|come%2:38:04:: to the South|south%3:00:00:: Country?" 
 
"To see|see%2:38:00:: the Good|good%3:00:01:: Witch|witch%1:18:03:: who rules|rule%1:26:00:: here," she answered. "Will you take|take%2:38:00:: 
me to her?" 
 
"Let me have|have%2:40:00:: your name|name%1:10:00:: and I will ask|ask%2:32:00:: Glinda if she will receive|receive%2:41:00:: 
you." They told|tell%2:32:04:: who they were, and the girl|girl%1:18:00:: soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: went|go%2:38:00:: into the 
Castle. After a few|few%3:00:00:: moments|moment%1:28:01:: she came|come%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to say|say%2:32:00:: that Dorothy and the 
others were|be%2:42:03:: to be|be%2:42:03:: admitted|admit%2:41:01:: at once. 
 
 
Chapter|chapter%1:10:00:: XXIII. 
 
 
Before they went|go%2:38:00:: to see|see%2:41:12:: Glinda, however, they were|be%2:42:03:: taken|take%2:38:09:: to a room|room%1:06:00:: of 
the Castle, where Dorothy washed|wash%2:29:00:: her face|face%1:08:00:: and combed|comb%2:35:01:: her hair, and 
the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: shook|shake%2:38:00:: the dust|dust%1:27:00:: out of his mane, and the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: patted|pat%2:35:01:: 
himself into his best|best%3:00:00:: shape, and the Woodman|woodman%1:18:01:: polished|polish%2:35:00:: his tin|tin%1:06:00:: and 
oiled|oil%2:35:00:: his joints. 
 
When they were|be%2:42:03:: all quite|quite%4:02:01:: presentable|presentable%3:00:00:respectable:00 they followed|follow%2:38:00:: the soldier|soldier%1:18:00:: girl|girl%1:18:02:: 
into a big|big%3:00:01:: room|room%1:06:00:: where the Witch|witch%1:18:03:: Glinda sat|sit%2:35:00:: upon a throne|throne%1:06:00:: of rubies. 
 
She was|be%2:42:03:: both beautiful|beautiful%3:00:00:: and young|young%3:00:00:: to their eyes. Her hair|hair%1:08:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: a rich|rich%3:00:00:colorful:00 
red|red%1:07:00:: in color|color%1:07:00:: and fell|fall%2:35:00:: in flowing|flowing%3:00:00:smooth:00 ringlets|ringlet%1:08:00:: over her shoulders. Her 
dress|dress%1:06:00:: was|be%2:42:03:: pure|pure%3:00:02:: white; but her eyes|eye%1:08:00:: were|be%2:42:03:: blue, and they looked|look%2:39:01:: kindly|kindly%4:02:00:: 
upon the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl. 
 
"What can I do|do%2:41:01:: for you, my child?" she asked. 
 
Dorothy told|tell%2:32:01:: the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: all her story; how the cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: brought|bring%2:38:00:: 
her to the Land|land%1:26:00:: of Oz, how she had|have%2:40:00:: found|find%2:40:02:: her companions, and of the 
wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 adventures|adventure%1:04:00:: they had|have%2:39:06:: met|meet%2:38:01:: with. 
 
"My greatest|great%3:00:01:extraordinary:00 wish|wish%1:12:00:: now," she added, "is to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas, for 
Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: will surely|surely%4:02:00:: think|think%2:31:01:: something dreadful|dreadful%3:00:00:alarming:00 has|have%2:40:00:: happened|happen%2:30:00:: to me, and 
that will make|make%2:30:00:: her put|put%1:04:00:: on mourning; and unless the crops|crop%1:20:00:: are|be%2:42:03:: better|better%3:00:00:: 
this year|year%1:28:01:: than they were|be%2:42:03:: last|last%3:00:00:past:00 I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: cannot afford|afford%2:34:00:: it." 
 
Glinda leaned|lean%2:38:00:: forward|forward%4:02:00:: and kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: the sweet, upturned face|face%1:08:00:: of the 
loving|loving%3:00:00:: little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl. 
 
"Bless your dear|dear%4:02:00:: heart," she said, "I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: I can tell|tell%2:31:00:: you of a way|way%1:04:01:: 
to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." Then|then%4:02:00:: she added: 
 
"But, if I do, you must give|give%2:40:00:: me the Golden Cap." 
 
"Willingly!" exclaimed|exclaim%2:32:01:: Dorothy; "indeed, it is|be%2:42:03:: of no use|use%1:07:00:: to me now, 
and when you have|have%2:40:00:: it you can command|command%2:32:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: three times." 
 
"And I think|think%2:31:03:: I shall need|need%2:34:00:: their service|service%1:04:08:: just|just%4:02:00:: those three times," 
answered|answer%2:32:00:: Glinda, smiling. 
 
Dorothy then|then%4:02:00:: gave|give%2:40:00:: her the Golden Cap, and the Witch|witch%1:18:01:: said|say%2:32:00:: to the 
Scarecrow, 
 
"What will you do|do%2:41:01:: when Dorothy has|have%2:40:00:: left|leave%2:31:05:: us?" 
 
"I will return|return%2:38:00:: to the Emerald City," he replied, "for Oz has|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:36:00:: me 
its ruler|ruler%1:18:00:: and the people|people%1:14:01:: like me. The only|only%3:00:00:single:05 thing|thing%1:09:02:: that worries|worry%2:37:01:: me is|be%2:42:06:: 
how to cross|cross%2:38:00:: the hill|hill%1:17:00:: of the Hammer-Heads." 
 
"By means|mean%1:09:00:: of the Golden Cap|cap%1:06:00:: I shall command|command%2:32:01:: the Winged Monkeys|monkey%1:05:00:: to 
carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to the gates|gate%1:06:00:: of the Emerald|emerald%1:27:00:: City," said|say%2:32:00:: Glinda, "for it 
would be|be%2:42:03:: a shame|shame%1:11:00:: to deprive|deprive%2:40:01:: the people|people%1:14:01:: of so|so%4:02:02:: wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 a ruler." 
 
"Am I really|really%4:02:03:: wonderful?" asked|ask%2:32:00:: the Scarecrow. 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: unusual," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Glinda. 
 
Turning|turn%2:38:00:: to the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, she asked: 
 
"What will become|become%2:30:00:: of you when Dorothy leaves|leave%2:38:01:: this country?" 
 
He leaned|lean%2:38:00:: on his axe|axe%1:06:00:: and thought|think%2:31:00:: a moment. Then|then%4:02:00:: he said, 
 
"The Winkies were|be%2:42:03:: very|very%4:02:00:: kind|kind%3:00:00:: to me, and wanted|want%2:37:00:: me to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over them 
after the Wicked|wicked%3:00:00:unrighteous:00 Witch|witch%1:18:00:: died. I am|be%2:42:03:: fond|fond%3:00:00:inclined:02 of the Winkies, and if I could 
get|get%2:30:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: again|again%4:02:00:: to the country|country%1:15:00:: of the West|west%1:15:01:: I should like|like%2:37:05:: nothing|nothing%1:23:00:: 
better|better%3:00:00:: than to rule|rule%2:41:00:: over them forever." 
 
"My second|second%3:00:00:ordinal:00 command|command%1:10:00:: to the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys," said|say%2:32:00:: Glinda, "will be|be%2:42:06:: that 
they carry|carry%2:35:02:: you safely|safely%4:02:00:: to the land|land%1:26:00:: of the Winkies. Your brains|brain%1:08:00:: may not|not%4:02:00:: 
be|be%2:42:03:: so|so%4:02:02:: large|large%3:00:00:: to look|look%2:39:00:: at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are|be%2:42:03:: really|really%4:02:03:: 
brighter|bright%3:00:00:colorful:00 than he is--when you are|be%2:42:03:: well|well%4:02:00:: polished--and I am|be%2:42:03:: sure|sure%3:00:00:: you 
will rule|rule%2:41:00:: the Winkies wisely|wisely%4:02:00:: and well." 
 
Then|then%4:02:00:: the Witch|witch%1:18:00:: looked|look%2:39:00:: at the big, shaggy Lion|lion%1:05:00:: and asked, 
 
"When Dorothy has|have%2:40:00:: returned|return%2:38:00:: to her own|own%3:00:00:personal:00 home, what will become|become%2:42:01:: of you?" 
 
"Over the hill|hill%1:17:00:: of the Hammer-Heads," he answered, "lies a grand|grand%3:00:00:impressive:00 old|old%3:00:02:: 
forest, and all the beasts|beast%1:03:00:: that live|live%2:42:08:: there have|have%2:40:00:: made|make%2:41:03:: me their King. 
If I could only|only%4:02:01:: get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to this forest|forest%1:14:00:: I would pass|pass%2:38:03:: my life|life%1:26:02:: very|very%4:02:00:: 
happily|happily%4:02:01:: there." 
 
"My third|third%3:00:00:ordinal:00 command|command%1:10:00:: to the Winged|winged%3:00:00:: Monkeys," said|say%2:32:00:: Glinda, "shall be|be%2:42:06:: to 
carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to your forest. Then, having|have%2:40:00:: used|use%2:34:01:: up|up%4:02:00:: the powers|power%1:09:01:: of the 
Golden|golden%3:00:00:chromatic:00 Cap, I shall give|give%2:40:00:: it to the King|king%1:18:00:: of the Monkeys, that he and 
his band|band%1:14:01:: may thereafter|thereafter%4:02:00:: be|be%2:42:03:: free|free%3:00:00:: for evermore." 
 
The Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: and the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman|woodman%1:18:00:: and the Lion|lion%1:05:00:: now|now%4:02:05:: thanked|thank%2:32:00:: the Good|good%1:07:00:: 
Witch|witch%1:18:03:: earnestly|earnestly%4:02:02:: for her kindness, and Dorothy exclaimed, 
 
 
 
"You are|be%2:42:03:: certainly|certainly%4:02:00:: as|as%4:02:00:: good|good%3:00:01:: as you are|be%2:42:03:: beautiful! But you have|have%2:40:00:: not|not%4:02:00:: yet|yet%4:02:04:: 
told|tell%2:32:04:: me how to get|get%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"Your Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: will carry|carry%2:35:02:: you over the desert," replied|reply%2:32:00:: Glinda. 
"If you had|have%2:40:00:: known|know%2:31:01:: their power|power%1:07:00:: you could have|have%2:41:00:: gone|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to your Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: 
Em the very|very%4:02:00:: first|first%3:00:00:: day|day%1:28:00:: you came|come%2:38:04:: to this country." 
 
"But then|then%4:02:02:: I should not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: my wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 brains!" cried|cry%2:32:01:: the 
Scarecrow. "I might have|have%2:40:00:: passed|pass%2:42:00:: my whole|whole%3:00:00:: life|life%1:28:02:: in the farmer's 
cornfield." 
 
"And I should not|not%4:02:00:: have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: my lovely|lovely%3:00:00:beautiful:00 heart," said|say%2:32:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman. "I 
might have|have%2:40:00:: stood|stand%2:42:04:: and rusted|rust%2:30:01:: in the forest|forest%1:14:00:: till the end|end%1:28:00:: of the world." 
 
"And I should have|have%2:40:00:: lived|live%2:42:04:: a coward|coward%1:18:00:: forever," declared|declare%2:32:06:: the Lion, "and 
no beast|beast%1:03:00:: in all the forest|forest%1:14:00:: would have|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: a good|good%3:00:01:: word|word%1:10:00:: to say|say%2:32:00:: to me." 
 
"This is|be%2:42:03:: all true," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, "and I am|be%2:42:03:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: I was|be%2:42:03:: of use|use%1:04:00:: to 
these good|good%3:00:01:: friends. But now|now%4:02:05:: that each of them has|have%2:40:00:: had|have%2:40:00:: what he most|most%3:00:02:: 
desired, and each is|be%2:42:03:: happy|happy%3:00:00:: in having|have%2:40:00:: a kingdom|kingdom%1:15:00:: to rule|rule%2:41:00:: beside, I|i%1:23:00:: 
think|think%2:31:03:: I should like|like%2:37:01:: to go|go%2:38:00:: back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas." 
 
"The Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes," said|say%2:32:00:: the Good|good%1:07:00:: Witch, "have wonderful|wonderful%3:00:00:extraordinary:00 powers. And 
one of the most|most%4:02:00:: curious|curious%3:00:00:strange:00 things|thing%1:07:00:: about them is|be%2:42:06:: that they can carry|carry%2:35:02:: you to 
any place|place%1:15:00:: in the world|world%1:17:01:: in three steps, and each step|step%1:04:02:: will be|be%2:42:03:: made|make%2:41:00:: in 
the wink|wink%1:28:00:: of an eye. All you have|have%2:40:00:: to do|do%2:41:01:: is|be%2:42:06:: to knock|knock%2:35:04:: the heels|heel%1:06:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: 
three times|time%1:11:00:: and command|command%2:32:00:: the shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: to carry|carry%2:35:02:: you wherever you wish|wish%2:37:02:: to go." 
 
"If that is|be%2:42:03:: so," said|say%2:32:00:: the child, joyfully, "I will ask|ask%2:32:01:: them to carry|carry%2:35:02:: 
me back|back%4:02:04:: to Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: at once." 
 
She threw|throw%2:35:00:: her arms|arm%1:08:00:: around the Lion's neck|neck%1:08:00:: and kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: him, patting 
his big|big%3:00:01:: head|head%1:08:00:: tenderly. Then|then%4:02:00:: she kissed|kiss%2:35:00:: the Tin|tin%1:27:00:: Woodman, who was|be%2:42:03:: 
weeping|weep%2:29:00:: in a way|way%1:07:01:: most|most%4:02:00:: dangerous|dangerous%3:00:00:: to his joints. But she hugged|hug%2:35:01:: the 
soft, stuffed|stuff%2:38:00:: body|body%1:08:00:: of the Scarecrow|scarecrow%1:06:00:: in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: instead|instead%4:02:00:: of kissing|kiss%2:35:00:: 
his painted|painted%3:00:00:: face, and found|find%2:39:02:: she was|be%2:42:03:: crying|cry%2:29:00:: herself at this sorrowful|sorrowful%3:00:00:: 
parting|parting%1:04:00:: from her loving|loving%3:00:00:: comrades. 
 
Glinda the Good|good%1:07:02:: stepped|step%2:38:00:: down|down%4:02:00:: from her ruby|ruby%1:27:00:: throne|throne%1:06:00:: to give|give%2:40:03:: the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 
girl|girl%1:18:02:: a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked|thank%2:32:00:: her for all the kindness|kindness%1:07:01:: 
she had|have%2:40:00:: shown|show%2:31:00:: to her friends|friend%1:18:00:: and herself. 
 
Dorothy now|now%4:02:05:: took|take%2:35:00:: Toto up|up%4:02:00:: solemnly|solemnly%4:02:00:: in her arms, and having|have%2:41:00:: said|say%2:32:00:: one 
last|last%3:00:00:closing:00 good-bye|good-bye%1:10:00:: she clapped|clap%2:29:00:: the heels|heel%1:06:00:: of her shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: together|together%4:02:02:: three 
times, saying, 
 
"Take me home|home%1:15:04:: to Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em!" 
 
 * * * * * 
 
 
 
Instantly|instantly%4:02:02:: she was|be%2:42:03:: whirling through the air, so|so%4:02:02:: swiftly|swiftly%4:02:00:: that all she 
could see|see%2:39:00:: or feel|feel%2:39:00:: was|be%2:42:06:: the wind|wind%1:19:00:: whistling|whistle%2:32:01:: past her ears. 
 
The Silver|silver%1:27:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: took|take%2:41:04:: but three steps, and then|then%4:02:00:: she stopped|stop%2:38:00:: so|so%4:02:09:: 
suddenly|suddenly%4:02:00:: that she rolled|roll%2:38:00:: over|over%4:02:01:: upon the grass|grass%1:20:00:: several|several%3:00:00:some:00 times|time%1:11:00:: before she 
knew|know%2:31:01:: where she was. 
 
At length, however, she sat|sit%2:38:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and looked|look%2:39:00:: about her. 
 
"Good gracious!" she cried. 
 
For she was|be%2:42:03:: sitting|sit%2:35:00:: on the broad|broad%3:00:04:: Kansas|kansa%1:10:00:: prairie, and just|just%4:02:01:: before 
her was|be%2:42:03:: the new|new%3:00:00:: farm-house Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:23:00:: built|build%2:36:00:: after the cyclone|cyclone%1:19:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: 
carried|carry%2:35:02:: away|away%4:02:01:: the old|old%3:00:02:: one. Uncle|uncle%1:18:00:: Henry|henry%1:18:02:: was|be%2:42:03:: milking|milk%2:30:00:: the cows|cow%1:05:01:: in the 
barnyard, and Toto had|have%2:40:00:: jumped|jump%2:38:00:: out of her arms|arm%1:08:00:: and was|be%2:42:03:: running|run%2:38:00:: toward 
the barn, barking|bark%2:32:00:: joyously. 
 
Dorothy stood|stand%2:35:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and found|find%2:39:02:: she was|be%2:42:05:: in her stocking-feet. For the 
Silver|silver%1:07:00:: Shoes|shoe%1:06:00:: had|have%2:42:00:: fallen|fall%2:38:03:: off|off%4:02:04:: in her flight|flight%1:04:00:: through the air, and were|be%2:42:03:: 
lost|lose%2:40:02:: forever|forever%4:02:00:: in the desert.

Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em|em%1:23:01:: had|have%2:42:00:: just|just%4:02:01:: come|come%2:38:00:: out of the house|house%1:06:00:: to water|water%2:30:00:: the cabbages|cabbage%1:13:00:: when she 
looked|look%2:39:00:: up|up%4:02:00:: and saw|saw%2:35:00:: Dorothy running|run%2:38:00:: toward her. 
 
"My darling|darling%1:18:00:: child!" she cried, folding|folding%3:00:00:collapsible:00 the little|little%3:00:00:young:00 girl|girl%1:18:00:: in her arms|arm%1:08:00:: and 
covering|cover%2:29:15:: her face|face%1:08:00:: with kisses; "where in the world|world%1:17:01:: did|do%2:36:01:: you come|come%2:42:09:: from?" 
 
"From the Land|land%1:15:02:: of Oz," said|say%2:32:00:: Dorothy, gravely. "And here|here%4:02:00:: is|be%2:42:05:: Toto, too. 
And oh, Aunt|aunt%1:18:00:: Em! I'm so|so%4:02:02:: glad|glad%3:00:00:: to be|be%2:42:05:: at home|home%1:15:04:: again!"
