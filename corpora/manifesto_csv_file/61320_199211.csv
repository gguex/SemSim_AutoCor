"A New Covenant with the American People",NA,NA
"Two hundred summers ago, this Democratic Party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the American Revolution - who once argued we should overthrow our own government every 20 years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world.","202",NA
"In 1992, the party Thomas Jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew.","201",NA
"Our land reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from America's very soul - from the families in our bedrock neighborhoods, from the unsung, workaday heroes of the world's greatest democracy and economy.","605",NA
"America is on the wrong track.","000",NA
"The American people are hurting.","606",NA
"The American Dream of expanding opportunity has faded.","410",NA
"Middle class families are working hard, playing by the rules, but still falling behind.","603",NA
"Poverty has exploded.","606",NA
"Our people are torn by divisions.","606",NA
"The last 12 years have been a nightmare of Republican irresponsibility and neglect.","305",NA
"America's leadership is indifferent at home and uncertain in the world.","305",NA
"Republican mismanagement has disarmed government as an instrument to make our economy work and support the people's most basic values, needs and hopes.","305",NA
"The Republicans brought America a false and fragile prosperity based on borrowing, not income, and so will leave behind a mountain of public debt and a backbreaking annual burden in interest.","305",NA
"It is wrong to borrow to spend on ourselves, leaving our children to pay our debts.","414",NA
"We hear the anguish and the anger of the American people.","606",NA
"We know it is directed not just at the Republican administrations that have had power, but at government itself.","606",NA
"Their anger is justified.","305",NA
"We can no longer afford business as usual -- neither the policies of the last 12 years of tax breaks for the rich, mismanagement, lack of leadership and cuts in services for the middle class and the poor, nor the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking.","503",NA
"It is time to listen to the grassroots of America, time to renew the spirit of citizen activism that has always been the touchstone of a free and democratic society.","606",NA
"Therefore we call for a revolution in government - to take power away from entrenched bureaucracies and narrow interests in Washington and put it back in the hands of ordinary people.","303",NA
"We vow to make government more decentralized, more flexible, and more accountable - to reform public institutions and replace public officials who aren't leading with ones who will.","301",NA
"The Revolution of 1992 is about restoring America's economic greatness.","408",NA
"We need to rebuild America by abandoning the something-for-nothing ethic of the last decade and putting people first for a change.","606",NA
"Only a thriving economy, a strong manufacturing base, and growth in creative new enterprise can generate the resources to meet the nation's pressing human and social needs.","408",NA
"An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy and foreign policy America can have.","408",NA
"The Revolution of 1992 is about putting government back on the side of working men and women - to help those who work hard, pay their bills, play by the rules, don't lobby for tax breaks, do their best to give their kids a good education and to keep them away from drugs, who want a safe neighborhood for their families, the security of decent, productive jobs for themselves, and a dignified life for their parents.","701",NA
"The Revolution of 1992 is about a radical change in the way government operates -","303",NA
"not the Republican proposition that government has no role, nor the old notion that there's a program for every problem, but a shift to a more efficient, flexible and results-oriented government that improves services, expands choices, and empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottom up.","303",NA
"We believe in an activist government, but it must work in a different, more responsive way.","303",NA
"The Revolution of 1992 is about facing up to tough choices.","606",NA
"There is no relief for America's frustration in the politics of diversion and evasion, of false choices or of no choices at all.","606",NA
"Instead of everyone in Washington blaming one another for inaction, we will act decisively -- and ask to be held accountable if we don't.","305",NA
"Above all the Revolution of 1992 is about restoring the basic American values that built this country and will always make it great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, tolerance, faith, family and hard work.","603",NA
"We offer the American people not only new ideas, a new course, and a new President, but a return to the enduring principles that set our nation apart: the promise of opportunity, the strength of community, the dignity of work, and a decent life for senior citizens.","603",NA
"To make this revolution, we seek a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American people and their government, that will expand opportunity, insist upon greater individual responsibility in return, restore community, and ensure national security in a profoundly new era.","606",NA
"We welcome the close scrutiny of the American people, including Americans who may have thought the Democratic Party had forgotten its way, as well as all who know us as the champions of those who have been denied a chance.","202",NA
"With this platform we take our case for change to the American people.","202",NA
"I. OPPORTUNITY",NA,NA
"Our Party's first priority is opportunity -- broad- based, non-inflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it.","410",NA
"Democrats in 1992 hold nothing more important for America than an economy that offers growth and jobs for all.","410",NA
"President Bush, with no interest in domestic policy, has given America the slowest economic growth, the slowest income growth, and the slowest jobs growth since the Great Depression.","305",NA
"And the American people know the long Bush recession reflects not just a business cycle, but a long-term slide, so that even in a fragile recovery we're sinking.","305",NA
"The ballooning Bush deficits hijacked capital from productive investments.","305",NA
"Savings and loan sharks enriched themselves at their country's expense.","503",NA
"The stock market tripled, but average incomes stalled, and poverty claimed more of our children.","503",NA
"We reject both the do-nothing government of the last twelve years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity.","305",NA
"Instead we offer a third way.","408",NA
"Just as we have always viewed working men and women as the bedrock of our economy, we honor business as a noble endeavor, and vow to create a far better climate for firms and independent contractors of all sizes that empower their workers, revolutionize their workplaces, respect the environment, and serve their communities well.","408",NA
"We believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces.","401",NA
"But economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy to invest in people.","404",NA
"For twelve years our country has had no economic vision, leadership or strategy.","305",NA
"It is time to put our people and our country first.","606",NA
"Investing in America.",NA,NA
"The only way to lay the foundation for renewed American prosperity is to spur both public and private investment.","410",NA
"We must strive to close both the budget deficit and the investment gap.","414",NA
"Our major competitors invest far more than we do in roads, bridges, and the information networks and technologies of the future.","411",NA
"We will rebuild America by investing more in transportation, environmental technologies, defense conversion, and a national information network.","411",NA
"To begin making our economy grow, the President and Congress should agree that savings from defense must be reinvested productively at home, including research, education and training, and other productive investments.","410",NA
"This will sharply increase the meager nine percent of the national budget now devoted to the future.","410",NA
"We will create a ""future budget"" for investments that make us richer, to be kept separate from those parts of the budget that pay for the past and present.","410",NA
"For the private sector, instead of a sweeping capital gains windfall to the wealthy and those who speculate, we will create an investment tax credit and a capital gains reduction for patient investors in emerging technologies and new businesses.","410",NA
"Support for Innovation.",NA,NA
"We will take back the advantage now ceded to Japan and Germany, which invest in new technologies at higher rates than the U. S.  and have the growth to show for it.","411",NA
"We will make the R&;D tax credit permanent, double basic research in the key technologies for our future, and create a civilian research agency to fast-forward their development.","411",NA
"The deficit.",NA,NA
"Addressing the deficit requires fair and shared sacrifice of all Americans for the common good.","606",NA
"In 12 Republican years a national debt that took 200 years to accumulate has been quadrupled.","414",NA
"Rising interest on that debt now swallows one tax dollar in seven.","414",NA
"In place of the Republican supply-side disaster, the Democratic investment, economic conversion and growth strategy will generate more revenues from a growing economy.","410",NA
"We must also tackle spending, by putting everything on the table; eliminate nonproductive programs; achieve defense savings; reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs; cut federal administrative costs by 3 percent annually for four years;","303",NA
"limit increases in the ""present budget"" to the rate of growth in the average American's paycheck; apply a strict ""pay as you go"" rule to new non-investment spending; and make the rich pay their fair share in taxes.","414",NA
"These choices will be made while protecting senior citizens and without further victimizing the poor.","706",NA
"This deficit reduction effort will encourage private savings, eliminate the budget deficit over time, and permit fiscal policies that can restore America's economic health.","414",NA
"Defense Conversion.",NA,NA
"Our economy needs both the people and the funds released from defense at the Cold War's end.","105",NA
"We will help the stalwarts of that struggle -- the men and women who served in our armed forces and who work in our defense industries – make the most of a new era.","706",NA
"We will provide early notice of program changes to give commun ties, businesses and workers enough time to plan.","706",NA
"We will honor and support our veterans.","706",NA

"Redirected national laboratories and a new civilian research agency will put defense scientists, engineers and technicians to work in critical civilian technologies.","105",NA
"Small business defense firms will have technical assistance and transition grants and loans to help convert to civilian markets, and defense dependent communities will have similar aid in planning and implementing conversion.","706",NA
"We will strongly support our civilian space program, particularly environmental missions.","411",NA
"The Cities.",NA,NA
"Only a robust economy will revitalize our cities.","408",NA
"It is in all Americans' interest that the cities once again be places where hard-working families can put down roots and find good jobs, quality health care, affordable housing, and decent schools.","504",NA
"Democrats will create a new partnership to rebuild America's cities after 12 years of Republican neglect.","305",NA
"This partnership with the mayors will include consideration of the seven economic growth initiatives set forth by our nation's mayors.","404",NA
"We will create jobs by investing significant resources to put people back to work, beginning with a summer jobs initiative and training programs for inner-city youth.","411",NA
"We support a stronger community development program and targeted fiscal assistance to cities that need it most.","301",NA
"A national public works investment and infrastructure program will provide jobs and strengthen our cities, suburbs, rural communities and country.","402",NA
"We will encourage the flow of investment to inner city development and housing through targeted enterprise zones and incentives for private and public pension funds to invest in urban and rural projects.","411",NA
"While cracking down on redlining and housing discrimination, we also support and will enforce a revitalized Community Reinvestment Act that challenges banks to lend to entrepreneurs and development projects;","410",NA

"Agriculture and the Rural Community.",NA,NA
"All Americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when our food and fiber are produced by hundreds of thousands of family farmers r ceiving fair prices for their products.","703",NA
"The abundance of our nation's food and fiber system should not be taken for granted.","703",NA
"The revolution that lifted America to the forefront of world agriculture was achieved through a unique partnership of public and private interests.","703",NA
"The inattention and hostility that has characterized Republican food, agricultural and rural development policies of the past twelve years have caused a crisis in rural America.","305",NA
"The cost of Republican farm policy has been staggering and its total failure is demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies.","305",NA
"A sufficient and sustainable agricultural economy can be achieved through fiscally responsible programs.","703",NA
"It is time to reestablish the private/public partnership to ensure that family farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment, so that consumers receive safe and nutritious foods,","703",NA

"by fighting on the side of family farmers to ensure they get a fair price for their hard work; by working to sustain rural communities;","703",NA

"and by supporting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively without fear of intimidation or permanent replacement during labor disputes.","701",NA
"Lifelong Learning.",NA,NA
"A competitive American economy requires the global market's best educated, best trained, most flexible workforce.","411",NA

"Affordable Health Care.",NA,NA
"All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care -- not as a privilege, but as a right.","504",NA
"That requires tough controls on health costs, which are rising at two to three times the rate of inflation, terrorizing American families and businesses and depriving millions of the care they need.","504",NA

"We believe that by what it says and how it conducts its business, government must once again make responsibility an instrument of national purpose.","301",NA

"During the past four years, we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges.","305",NA
"Under President Bush, crises have been managed, rather than prevented; dictators like Saddam Hussein have been wooed, rather than deterred; aggression by the Serbian regime against its neighbors in what was Yugoslavia has been met by American timidity r ther than toughness; human rights abusers have been rewarded, not challenged; the environment has been neglected, not protected; and America's competitive edge in the global economy has been dulled, not honed.","305",NA
