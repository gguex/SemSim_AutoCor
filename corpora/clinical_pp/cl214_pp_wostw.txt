process taking useful accurate sexual history sufficiently threatening clinicians justify special comment
easy physician excuse omission sexual history one several grounds
im hurry
isnt pertinent patient illness
patient didnt mention sexual complaint
respect patient privacy whenever possible
ask sexual questions patient may think im pervert nut
patient might embarrassed
next time
gynecologist takes care
real reasons often
really dont know go
im always hurry never take complete history
never ask sexual questions
forgot interested comfortable problem
asked uncovered problem wouldnt idea
would embarrassed
often forget patients sexual lives important
cant send everyone psychiatrist
nobody sex life perfect included
taking sexual history serves two functions
first may identify problem areas justify active treatment
second serves notice patient physician sees sexual function important integral part medical history lifestyle patient demonstrates physician ready willing discuss sexual problems future patient desire
patient views sexual life performance private important
illness likely impact sexual feelings activity patient wants know facts understand thoroughly
patient sexual partner equally involved concerned anxious information
partner ask soon could begin make love
postoperative postcoronary patient said take easy awhile
partner mean
postoperative patient dont know
difficult think illness impact sexual function tonsillitis long infectious
broken foot cant get top cast leg
often patient initial complaint intended introduction patient hopes lead specific discussion sexual problems
patient im pains stomach havent feeling well lately
physician deals initial complaint summarily dismisses unimportant patient becomes confused angry hoped gradual disclosure thwarted
however sexual function history becomes routine part data collection patient nonthreatening opportunity expand original complaint
like parts database type complexity data collected vary according patient problem
familiarity various forms human sexual inadequacy makes physician sensitive patient response indicates directions questioning
familiarity normal sexual anatomy physiology lends physician sense confidence assurance dealing sexually confused dysfunctional patients
words allow us transfer complex ideas experiences another person rapidly
physician patient communicate must find common equally acceptable vocabulary information ideas feelings exchanged effectively comfortably
following techniques useful dealing sexual words
never accept sexual term face value sure patient means
patient im impotent
physician mean trouble getting erection trouble keeping erection long enough use something else
mean
term impotent mean
sensitive inquiring sort terms patient comfortable
keep mental written list
appears necessary discuss sexual function length patient permissible ask directly terms patient partner use together
physician husband talking penis sexual organ call
patient seems confused terminology may helpful use several different terms series convey idea
terms selected usually least loaded words known
physician pain discomfort vulvayour female organsyour privates
patient used nonscientific understandable sexual term permissible physician use term
patient really like goes
physician ever comehave orgasmwhen goes
rarely cautiously physician may introduce common slang terms conversation
often done younger patients usually mutual respect rapport established patient physician
physician seems youve saying lot screwing marriage much loving
patient right
often physician patient try use physician vocabulary
results discomfort confusion part patient may trying use understand unfamiliar half understood words
communication enhanced physician adapts patient instead vice versa
effective physician must master many vocabularies adjust language meet communication needs individual patients
part art medicine rather science
important skill surgical technique differential diagnosis
american culture sexual words particularly difficult patients often physicians well
instead accepting simple tools effective communication sorts taboos value judgments made inhibit free use sexual words
words common everyday usage people regarded gross obscenities others
patients often feel words know use regularly acceptable physician father authority figure
patients therefore often uncomfortable using words uncertain precise meaning scientific less familiar slang expressions
many commonly used terms multiple meanings
examples
make may mean manual oral foreplay contexts sexual intercourse others
go bed covers range activities watching television sleep coitus
patients often use terms believe earn approval physicians
many may imperfectly understood incorrectly used well intentioned patient e g pain vagina
words inherently dirty indecent immoral
physicians use sexual words patients familiar comfortable
sexual history taking grave risk examiner assume much patient superficial clues examiner personal biases
assumptions put examiner great disadvantage confuse well embarrass patient
usual result assumptions loss time valuable information rapport patient
axiomatic examiner certain anything concerning patient sexuality superficial examination dress manner style
indeed many patients dress manners style deliberate unconscious strategies hide true sexual feelings attitudes
best approach patients clean slate allow express personal feelings attitudes
observations dress manners style coupled history extremely informative must distract examiner history taking
examiner biases may distract direction history taking
common biases
young people arent sexual yet
old people arent sexual anymore
dignified mature men women cant concerned sexuality
married people cant venereal disease
nice people dont enjoy sexual variations
girls dress sexy sexy
effeminate men gay
always tell gay people way act
sick people arent sexual
blind deaf cerebral palsied paraplegic people arent sexual
women arent gay
women dont get horny
nobody ever heard fellatio cunnilingus much less tried
mother father never intercourseor least oftenor least anymore
woman must either want man already man
patients never get sexually interested doctors
doctors never get sexually interested patients
fat people arent sexual
ugly people arent sexual
retarded people arent sexual
black people different white people
oriental people probably different black people white peopleat least inscrutable polite
two kinds women good kind mothers sisters kind
world pretty much way see normal people pretty much like except exceptional
acting similar biases erase much effectiveness history taker
people biases sort determined learned concept world like
setting aside biases conscious act requiring practice best partial
reason history taker begin clean slate
sexual preference partners sex occurs perhaps men women
statistics precisely accurate since public attitudes toward homosexuality often judgmental punitive many individuals feel need conceal sexual preference least advertise publicly
easier homosexual women live life sex partner homosexual men culture tolerant permissive women share living quarters tends show anxiety adult men live together
questions homosexuality routine part survey type history perhaps inquiries become
recent years begun recognize rather striking differences health risks among homosexual women men compared heterosexual population
homosexual women example little need contraception low risk venereal disease
carcinoma cervix epidemiologically related early initiation sexual intercourse multiplicity coital partners exclusively homosexual women reduced risk cervical cancer
male homosexuals contrast high risk venereal disease increased risk parasitic infestations prime risk group aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome
sadomasochistic behavior somewhat common male homosexuals general population individuals perhaps likely present foreign bodies signs genital anal trauma
vast majority homosexual men women different dress grooming voice mannerisms heterosexual people fact live similar lives
one assume superficial behavior appearance rules preference sex partners
useful discard whatever stereotypes picked approach patient open mind data reveal sexual preference
many individuals eventually accept homosexual orientation may gone years typical heterosexual activities previously
includes heterosexual dating marriage coitus child bearing rearing
individuals may enjoy opportunities heterosexual homosexual relationships experiences
individuals even though homosexual may wish parenting strongly undertake conceive child children rear

per week per month
significant change frequency intercourse last several years
give idea decreased increased
reasons change may include either patient partner factors
things illness physical separation depression alienation sexual boredom fatigue work household pressures fears conception may given reasons decrease
things improved interpersonal relationships relief fear pregnancy new partner regained health may given reasons increased frequency
patient responds negatively question sexual intercourse determine whether absence sexual activity partner change previous habits lifelong habit
lifelong habit determined voluntary choice result factors
similarly celibacy change patient inquiry made reason reasons
death serious illness partner divorce separation prolonged sexual dysfunction emotional incompatibility may given explanation sexual abstinence
age marital status used indicators whether patient sexually active partner partners
sexual intercourse implying penile vaginal sexual connection may always appropriate exact term use order describe interpersonal sexual relationship
patient may heterosexual andor homosexual relationships include oral manual instrumental sexual manipulation orgasm penile anal penetration least technically still intercourse
patients nonjudgmental setting quibble extreme respond questions sexual experiences fairly readily quite frankly
never make mistake assuming elderly ill disabled patients sexually active
frequency sexual intercourse varies according opportunity attitude health age
coital frequency marriage decreases fairly rapidly advancing age many couples coitus persists well seventies eighties
mistake allow patients feel regard abnormal atypical coital frequency
couples regularly coitus several times per day may normal couples seek sexual connection every months
biological capacity women sexual intercourse orgasm far greater men
capacity multiple read unlimited numbers orgasms well documented
male capacity coitus leading orgasm ejaculation limited refractory period
although young men sometimes repeated orgasms single sitting general postorgasmic period males first difficult develop erection later erection possible difficult ejaculate
period time varies minutes younger men one several days aging men
elongation refractory period normal part male aging process increased time attain erection decreased firmness erection reduced force ejaculation
none sign impending impotence aging man
takes aging man longer walk around block physical evidence sexual arousal somewhat delayed
less pleasurable gratifying
aging women results reduction vaginal lubrication thinning vaginal mucosa ordinarily decrease capacity sexual performance unless postmenopausal vaginal atrophy occurred
maintenance active partner oriented sexual life advancing age depends three factors men
interested interesting partner reasonably good state general health continuance sexual activity without interruption
aging man whose opportunity partner sexual relations interrupted separation partner death illness partner period months may lose ability develop maintain erection sufficient effect satisfactory penetration
disuse phenomenon may roughly compared athlete drops training

masturbation induction sexually pleasurable sensations self another person means physical psychic stimuli usually deliberate
often necessarily carried point orgasm
synonyms include autoeroticism onanism self gratification self abuse jacking host slang terms
performed partners upon called mutual masturbation
masturbation implies something genital genital contact
sensory stimuli tactile thermal visual auditory gustatory proprioceptive olfactory
psychic stimuli often involve dream fantasy memory
recently active self induction sexual pleasure heavily discouraged persons positions authority many individuals feel great guilt perceive masturbation problem weakness perversity
masturbation one form another almost universal activity among men probably equally among women
taking history masturbation physician nonthreatening accepting reassuring permission giving
following questions asked men first learn masturbation
high school college years sexual outlets besides masturbation
since marriage frequency masturbation increased decreased stayed
approximately often masturbating orgasm present time
women self masturbation even guilt laden males since traditionally american culture women less freedom express sexuality
consequence women avoid direct obvious self stimulation e genital stroking still make heavy use sensuous fabrics scents lotions touch massage light loose clothing daydreams self gratification excite others sexually
women may reluctant identify masturbatory activities readily admit stimuli sensually pleasurable enjoyed
direct sexual self stimulation nevertheless common among women
problems sexual functioning present data masturbation essential part history
questioning proceed general toward specific describe situations find particularly pleasurable physical sensethings feel good body
often patient uncertain reluctant offer anything
examples long hot steak dinner wine use bath powder body lotion back rubs suggested physician sensual experiences patient encouraged think terms body pleasures
kinds things think make feel sexually exciting excited
people orgasms sexual daydreams fantasies remember fantasies daydreams made become excited
ever orgasm dreaming fantasy
women able orgasm touching stroking breasts touching breasts sexually exciting
ever able orgasm way
ever able orgasm rubbing touching stroking part body
female organs
clitoris
ever used electric vibrator give sexual pleasure
line questions discloses patient regularly irregularly enjoys self stimulation questions technique asked
many women masturbate genital stimulation avoid direct clitoral stroking clitoris exquisitely sensitive
commonly finger alongside clitoris labia minora employed
women employ intravaginal instruments self stimulation although women whose sexual experiences penis oriented
normal frequency masturbation males females
males masturbation like coitus usually followed refractory period variable length depending age habit strength sexual stimuli
masturbatory frequency likewise dictated levels sexual tension opportunity absence distractions habit strength sexual stimuli
frequencies varying several times per day never considered normal
females absence physiologic postorgasmic refractory period increases possibility multiple occurrences within limited time frame
women regularly attain dozen self induced orgasms per day without known deleterious effect
among prostitutes repeated sexual experiences course work ten induce high levels sexual tension may result multiple orgasms concomitant relief pelvic congestion
relief pelvic congestion may subsequently obtained orgasm masturbation orgasmic coitus desired partner
masturbation orgasm also used women relieve pelvic congestion menstruation
times sexual activity women without serious sexual inhibitions rarely reject almost always encourage direct indirect sexual stimulation accepted partner readily stimulate accepted partner many means disposal
mutual masturbation form therefore common become rule satisfactory sexual relationships
masturbatory history men useful least four circumstances
establish typical adolescent development sexual tension subsequent gratification developed determine individual emotional response emerging overt sexuality document patient continuing ability attain erection ejaculation e absence structural damage give evidence persisting libido determine postmasturbatory refractory period contributing coital erective difficulty ejaculatory incompetence
additionally masturbatory history may give important insights patient sexual fantasy life
masturbatory history women also useful reasons
give indication patient range sexual experiences responses add data concepts sexuality sexual person give evidence persisting libido define specific stimuli patient finds pleasurable
encouragement masturbation women used technique previously anorgasmic woman learn orgasm like sorts stimuli finds gratifying
accepting permission experiment self gratification anorgasmic women whose prior training conditioning restrict activity able identity orgasmic goal seek
thereafter coital efforts reach orgasm advantage clearly defined experienced goal
female masturbatoty history may therefore give important background information base future therapy program
premature ejaculation defined inability male control ejaculatory process intravaginal containment long enough satisfy female partner least coital opportunities
definition patterned masters johnson breaks female partner persistently anorgasmic
premature ejaculation variously defined others ejaculation less seconds vaginal containment less minute etc
definition leaves something desired
line questioning elicit problem patient attempts deal
intercourse fairly regularly long would last
long usually time put penis would climax come orgasm
typical answer premature ejaculator considerably less minutes unless patient prior orgasm masturbation coitus
ever time climaxed got penis
tell time circumstances
longest time could intercourse without ejaculating
tell
partner able orgasm intercourse
cant come intercourse ever use hand mouth vibrator help come
intercourse
feel control youll come
would like able last longer
partner ever said would like intercourse last longer
factor control important introduce terms history future therapy
characteristically premature ejaculators describe lacking control
tried anything make last longer
kinds things tried
premature ejaculators usually attempt variety strategies delay ejaculation
range intellectual distraction self induced pain topical anesthetic agents
destructive strategies include deliberately avoiding foreplay reduce levels sexual excitation avoiding touch partner reduced vigor thrusting coitus
female partner often retaliates violent efforts reach orgasm male partner ejaculates
means often attempts make strong pelvic thrusting movements actions designed minimize friction excitation
thus partners goal prolongation coitus orgasm trying achieve goal diametrically opposite means
sexual act therefore likely end failure frustration
couples problem premature ejaculation rarely require detailed questioning elicit history
given sympathetic nonjudgmental listener readily relate history classic repeated minimal variations almost every case
examiner familiar usual sequence events sexual partnership frustrated premature ejaculation requires little perception recognize story
often female partner complainant
complaint usually begins dissatisfaction usual pattern lovemaking highlighted inadequate foreplay infrequent orgasm frequent postcoital pelvic congestion increasing frustration
pattern led decreased coital frequency recrimination degeneration interpersonal relationship often development secondary impotence part husband
man likely complainant college educated
likely express concern feels degree responsible partner gratification lack
seems largely cultural phenomenon
decrease frequency coitus significantly increases severity premature ejaculation increased sexual tension levels
manner period separation new exciting partner increases severity premature ejaculation
premature ejaculation certainly common male sexual dysfunction
common young men
men age premature ejaculation learn ejaculatory control
cooperation warm sympathetic partner facilitates learning process
man pronounced premature ejaculation sufficiently excited anxious may ejaculate sight sound touch woman
sometimes situation sexual performance expected may ejaculate touch
ejaculation become reflex phenomenon voluntary control lost never learned
terms sexual response cycle excitation leads ejaculation minimal intervening plateau phase
premature ejaculators specific personality type psychic pathology
classical psychoanalysis therapy premature ejaculation reported helen singer kaplan minimally successful although forms psychotherapy may useful helping premature ejaculator cope emotional problems engendered dysfunction
premature ejaculation believed learned response therefore treated uncomplicated cases retraining ejaculatory control
premature ejaculators fall two major groups
born often early sexual experiences prostitutes
setting sexual performance male gratification oriented customer performs quickly wins approval prostitute clients
among men born early experiences less often prostitutes commonly enacted situations urgency risk discovery disapproval authorities important drive movies automobile back seats living room sofas
sexual experiences primarily male gratification oriented couples encouraged perform quickly
addition men premature ejaculation commonly history premarital petting orgasm rubbing partner fully clothed use coitus interruptus form contraception male gratification situations
uncommonly man premature ejaculation presents complaint secondary impotence
experience unable exert ejaculatory control repeated frustrating coitus unhappy complaining wife reduced sexual stimuli degenerating marital relationship contribute sense sexual marital inadequacy
common sexual counseling situation encountered anorgasmic wife premature ejaculator husband may may secondarily impotent
inability ejaculate achieving erection termed ejaculatory incompetence
begin asking ever find erection right unable cometo ejaculate
first notice
happen time sometimes
noticed relationship long since last time ejaculated
taking drugs medicines present time started problem began
remember anything going marriageany problem began time problem
ejaculatory incompetence regarded many form impotence
ejaculation brought sympathetic parasympathetic nervous systems
ejaculatory center probably located lumbar region spinal cord
initially sympathetic division causes muscle contractions deliver semen urethra
parasympathetic system causes clonic spasms muscles surrounding urethra subsequent expulsion fluid
ejaculatory incompetence relatively uncommon described several circumstances
part male refractory period
male orgasm ejaculation occur period time difficult man regain erection
erection attainable second phase ejaculation difficult impossible requires prolonged penile stroking
advancing age second phase lengthens time
advancing age need end coitus ejaculation decreases
patient may interpret failing powers impending impotence simply change due aging diminishes gratification little
general categories pharmacologic agents may contribute erective difficulty may cases retard ejaculation
men consciously restrain ejaculation period time avoid conception reasons may retrain thereafter difficulty ejaculating wish
occasionally emotionally traumatic events discovery children discovery sexual partner husband reported inhibit subsequent ability ejaculate
erectile difficulty inability develop sustain penile erection sufficient time accomplish sexual connection ejaculation
term impotence like frigidity judgmental disparaging probably avoided physicians
however common usage
true impotence classified primary secondary psychic physical
primary impotence failure ever sustained penile erection time sufficient accomplish intromission whether partner male female whether orifice vagina mouth anus
secondary impotence failure accomplish erection sufficient penile intromission least sexual opportunities regardless partner sex orifice assumes least one successful previous intromission
ability masturbate successfully nocturnal emissions morning erections invalidate diagnose impotence erectile difficulty
abilities commonly persist psychogenic impotence often disappear organic impotence
ask present time ever difficulty getting erection want

physical causes secondary impotence fall three major categories
general debilitating diseases
men seriously ill debilitated may lose ability develop sustain erections
kind reaction partner wife problem
feel
things two lately
inability achieve sustain penile erection appropriate circumstances desired patient important complaint
physician must indicate patient complaint accepted important avoiding suggestion nature complaint devalues complainant impotence serious
sexual history taking matter fact nonjudgmental approach reassuring patient productive physician
sometimes questioner finds taking history male impotence involved female partner presenting complainant
questions may differ slightly form content
patient initial complaint impotence must evaluated carefully rather accepted face value alone
uncommonly patient may complain impotence actual problem one following
loss libido ejaculatory incompetence premature ejaculation disinterest partner change quality quantity sexual performance one level lesser level decrease volume force ejaculate increase length postcoital refractory period sexual exhaustion normal changes aging unwillingness inability meet sexual needs desires real proposed partner anxieties penile size
examiners must alert possibilities
probably impotence large psychic component rather purely physical origin
following points help differentiate psychic physical causes
neurologic andor vascular diseases
whether conditions central peripheral may significant impact potency
pharmacologic
included particularly antihypertensive agents psychotropic drugs antiulcer therapy estrogens
men consult physicians psychic erective problems may tranquilizers prescribed potentiate problem rather diminish
two common events related development secondary impotence episodes acute alcoholic intoxication history premature ejaculation
men erectile failure occasionally
often attributable emotional intellectual fatigue physical fatigue
typical male response experience feeling regret coupled self accepted rationalization fatigue distraction cause significant threat future sexual function
dysfunctional male apt view isolated episode erectile failure portent future impotence begin respond high levels anxiety ability perform

male virgin significant insecurity ability play male sexual role intolerable levels anxiety ability perform may lead primary impotence
insecurity may arise absence adequate male role model excessive maternal domination adolescent homosexual experiences excessive religious orthodoxy lack encouragement reassurance previous humiliating experiences
frigidity lay term implying lack sexual responsiveness
word frigid usually applied woman judgmental way another person
terms cold indifferent often applied men
response questions woman satisfaction sexuality partner satisfaction may indicate word frigid used describe sexual responses attitudes
avoid word frigid
medical meaning moreover deprecatory disparaging
used patient ask instead precise description complaint dont know word means

problems sometimes included within term following
lack factual knowledge shyness poor body image rejection unwanted lover unacceptable sexual practice lack willingness experiment try new sexual experiences difference sexual needs partners sexual social inexperience primary anorgasmia secondary anorgasmia situational anorgasmia random anorgasmia anger failure communicate partner leading sexual rejection insufficient lubrication dyspareunia vaginismus sexual anesthesia loss libido fear pregnancy emotional reaction previous rape sexual aversion
examiner explore complaint patient assess much problem patient failure achieve expectations achieve sexual partner expectations achieve authority expectations
expectations fact realistic
failure achieve expectation represent inability unwillingness disagreement goals absence information absence permission
withholding dispensing sexual favors nurturing tenderness warmth touching cuddling holding grooming caressing traditional barometer interpersonal closeness sexual partners satisfaction one another
sexual relationship manipulation sexual favors used make war make peace
displeasure partner responsiveness leads anger frustration anxiety
anger anxiety often lead name calling thus frigidity coldness
problems also occur among male partners cold indifferent sexually nonassertive man relatively common female complaint
women men said sexually aversive actually avoid sexual expression experience
sometimes avoidance accompanied denial sexual feelings anxiety anger
sexual aversion represents one end spectrum sexual responsiveness
extreme characterized sexual interest pleasure excitement sexual gratification
great majority men women found interest pleasure excitement end spectrum
excessive sexual interest e g juanism men nymphomania women associated continuing unsuccessful search sexual gratification

general lower animals well enjoy gratified experience feeling seek repeat experience
experience feeling painful frustrating seek avoid
sexual aversion may way life may response situation
expression sexual feelings blocked circumstance inhibition may handled denial sublimation giving individual neutral disinterested uninvolved posture
disinterest aversion sexual expression important symptom justifying investigation
men women demonstrative overtly affectionate may actually yearn warmer intimate relationship
often found individuals lack satisfactory role model pattern consequence practice experience close nurturing interpersonal relationship
sometimes previous sexual social experiences unsatisfactory individual avoids risk intimacy order avoid risk hurt
application disparaging label alienates individual
properly defined problem analyzed constituent elements turn explored
women inability achieve orgasm termed anorgasmia
three types
primary anorgasmia never achieved orgasm circumstance heterosexual homosexual without partner
situational anorgasmia inability achieve orgasm regularly one desired sexual circumstances means penile oral manual stimulation
patient may orgasmic masturbation penile vaginal coitus vice versa
may orgasmic homosexual relationship heterosexual one vice versa
random anorgasmia ability respond fully times others unpredictable fashion
many women orgasmic portion coital opportunities however one woman may satisfied orgasmic coital experiences another may frustrated achieves orgasm opportunities
another form random anorgasmia involves woman regularly orgasmic past ceased
properly called secondary anorgasmia
fact coitus approximate frequency described examiner begin determine patient satisfaction sexual intercourse pleasurable
enjoy
find unsatisfying
addition anorgasmia possible answers include coitus frequent infrequent insufficient foreplay pain penile insertion deep thrusting dissatisfaction partner feeling used rapid ejaculation insufficient closeness tenderness resolution phase sexual excitement
orgasm intercourse
approximately percentage time
frequency orgasm satisfactory
even frequency orgasm far patient expresses satisfaction present level usually need physician pursue matter
patient previously orgasmic ceased search temporal reference try relate important physical pharmacologic emotional social interpersonal events remember began hard reach orgasm
anything particular happening life along time
change birth control methods get sick serious fight husbandanything like
remember else going life time
history taking helpful ask patient insights idea made difficult orgasms along time
often directly asked patients volunteer meaningful observations perceptions otherwise might missed
orgasms among women vary
one may simple physical release complicated typical man
commonly physical response prepared elaborate complex list sexual values expectations must met satisfactorily woman fully responsive
many sexual values never consciously defined woman much less someone else
among sex therapists much history taking aimed defining woman sexual value system
orgasm men usually occurs rather early adolescence called wet dreams masturbation
among women even though many sexually exciting experiences dreams fantasies kissing caressing may occurred adolescence young adulthood orgasm often occurred
common women orgasmic coitus become well established pattern
presumably related acceptance sexual role sense comfort confidence partner relationship well experience learning pan
woman failed achieve orgasm within self determined expected range time experience unwarranted lack self confidence doubt womanhood sometimes begin appear
coupled often confusion orgasm feels like
american society orgasm man way keeping score
man may view female partner absence orgasm e success reflection ability lover
may react feelings guilt deprived partner orgasm feelings something wrong relationship frigid
feelings additional burden woman relationship bear
woman maximally sexually responsive personal sexual values must met
female sexual dysfunctions related unfulfilled unrealistic nonserving sexual value system
sexual value system composed biophysical psychosocial factors
biophysical factors include things health fatigue warmth comfort sight sound odor taste touch
psychosocial factors include things respect tenderness acceptance anger approval disgust conditioning learned values
example one woman might find idea sexual relationship tall dark hairy bearded silent stevedore exciting another would unexcited unless partner fair haired loquacious clean shaven college professor
however gross oversimplification complex ever changing state conscious unconscious attitude need
sometimes learned sexual values nonserving
example young woman may learned mother young men interested taking sexual advantage
consequence finds hard trusting open social contact men loses opportunities establish gratifying relationship
woman anorgasmic examiner must carefully explore sexual values well experiences order determine values unfulfilled unrealistic nonserving
examiner must also determine much nonthreatening opportunity learn orgasmic patient
significant pressure patient either self induced received partner orgasmic therefore normal really sexy difficult fully unselfconsciously sexually responsive
lack orgasmic response may self interpreted reducing value person implying less feminine less real woman others
feelings may result anxiety depression
woman regular sexual partner impotent ejaculates prematurely may react anger hostility exaggerated self doubt sexual identity capacity satisfactory sexual partner
many women therefore become insecure well partners
sometimes women anorgasmic deny responsibility ascribe lack sexual responsiveness entirely partner inadequacies
extent may real persons must accept ultimate responsibility sexual gratification
patients ascribe sexual problem partner accept responsibility understanding solution real problem thwarted
many patients conscious unconscious effort define partner fault go outside marriage partnership try another sexual partner
sometimes extramarital sexual relationship serves simply experiment designed clarify fault partnership
sometimes relationship serves achieve gratification found marriage
seldom solves original problem
clear distinction must made gratifying enjoyable sexual experience orgasm one form sexual gratification
many women report sexual intercourse may pleasurable enjoyable desired gratifying even orgasm occurs
orgasm provides dramatic sudden relief sexual tension myotonia vascular engorgement nonorgasmic coitus lesser levels sexual tension may still provide opportunities closeness tenderness excitement touching holding caressing significantly rewarding
sexual tension close orgasmic levels orgasm obtained unrelieved pelvic vascular engorgement often leads prolonged pelvic congestion
congestion plus unfulfilled expectations orgasmic release pleasure make coital experience frustrating
even orgasm achieved coital experience may unsatisfying patient expectations tenderness foreplay met
dyspareunia painful uncomfortable sexual intercourse
term usually applied women although circumstances intercourse may painful men
vaginismus one cause dyspareunia
vaginismus involuntary spastic contraction muscles perineum
results temporary narrowing vaginal opening pain attempted insertion object vagina
susceptible individuals involuntary contraction precipitated real threatened vaginal invasion relieved cessation attempted invasion
ask ever pain discomfort sexual intercourse
answer yes try establish temporal relationship
problem
bother time sometimes
circumstances pain
particular position particular time month menstrual cycle
makes pain worse
anything partner avoid make better
ever made stop intercourse made avoid intercourse
hurt first start first puts penis penis inserted pain feel deep thrusting pushes deep inside hits something inside
critical question helps differentiate problems superficial penetration vaginismus rigid hymen absence lubrication atrophic vaginal epithelium vaginitis introital scarring problems deep penetration prolapsed ovary cul de sac pelvic inflammatory disease endometriosis retroverted uterus pelvic peritonitis universal joint syndrome
questions lubrication resolved asking find lubricate get wet easily get sexually excited
ever seem dry
dryness seem part problem
used kind artificial lubricant
lack lubrication may secondary dyspareunia since repeated pain attempted intercourse interferes sexual excitement lubrication
even organic cause dyspareunia exists absence sufficient sexual excitement initiation penile thrusting results deficient lubrication causes pain thereby decreasing excitement lubrication
vicious cycle set
absence sufficient excitement also sometimes causes pain deep penetration upper vagina undergo characteristic ballooning
atrophic vaginitis cause dyspareunia occurs women surgically castrated postmenopausal estrogen supplementation restore vaginal epithelium normal thick resilient status
long since menstrual period
given hormone treatment since surgery since periods stopped
pain discomfort lasts intercourse finished quit hurting soon stop
discharge burning itching around vulva privates female organs
seem swollen
pain deep penetration random rather frequent consistent suggests penis thrust ovary temporarily lodged cul de sac
pain consistent coital positions deep penetration questions related deep pelvic pathology arise
pain intercourse considered organic proven otherwise
evaluated without concomitant physical examination
examiner attempt reproduce patient pain examination
often precisely located specific site identified exactly
examiner willingness accept pain source physical reassuring patient often freely describe psychic overlay makes dyspareunia troublesome
psychophysiologic interplay pain sexual excitement lubrication easily explored patient physician together
dyspareunia situation history taking examination reassurance patient education specific treatment proceed rapidly intermingled difficult separate
excessively large male organ rarely cause dyspareunia
presence adequate levels sexual excitement mature vagina dilates depth diameter accommodate almost erect penis
presence object penis finger vagina increases vaginal capacity
excessively long penis increases possible length stroke penile length increases rigidity decreases somewhat penis becomes limber
may disadvantage since shaft may bend midst thrusting
coital vaginal lacerations anterior posterior cervix vaginal fornices described rarely patient may present emergency room vaginal bleeding
personal impression often due excessive coital vigor excessive penile length
cases use foreign objects vagina must ruled
normal premenopausal vagina sexually excited adult woman resilient structure exception occasional minor superficial mucosal tears easily damaged wide range sexual experiences
pain intercourse therefore suggests nonphysiologic process way
often possible relieve dyspareunia deep penetration change coital position primary cause pain seems temporarily permanently inaccessible
experimentation early relationship couples adopt two perhaps three coital positions usual pattern seldom experiment much
commonly used position man woman female thighs flexed allows deep penile penetration increases chance pain unsusceptible individuals
