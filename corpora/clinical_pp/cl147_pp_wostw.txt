anemia defined decrease red blood cell mass
accurate measurements require labeling erythrocytes followed vivo quantification dilution labeled cells circulation
obviously impractical method detection anemia measurements either hemoglobin concentration hematocrit red blood cell count used
latter methods complicated fact represent concentrations altered variations plasma volume without changes red blood cell mass
usually usually important clinical setting detection anemia considered physician
world health organization decided anemia exists adults whose hemoglobin values lower gdl males gdl females
children age months years considered anemic hemoglobin levels gdl years gdl
disadvantage arbitrary criteria include normal individuals fall defined value
united states slightly higher values usually cited males hemoglobin
gdl females hemoglobin
gdl probably considered anemic
higher values anticipated individuals living altitudes significantly sea level
conditions increase plasma volume last trimester pregnancy lower hemoglobin values encountered even though red cell mass normal
carefully obtained history physical examination obtained every patient suspected anemia provide important clues underlying disorder
investigation anemia important ask certain questions addition conveniently explored routine periodic examination
areas inquiry found valuable briefly discussed
duration anemia often established obtaining history previous blood examination obtaining records
similarly history rejection blood donor prior prescription hematemics may provide clues anemia previously detected
careful family history obtained anemia also jaundice cholelithiasis splenectomy bleeding disorders abnormal hemoglobins
patient occupation hobbies prior medical treatment drugs household exposures potentially noxious agents carefully queried
patients volunteer exposure tranquilizers aspirin insecticides paints solvents hair dyes unless specifically asked
searching blood loss careful documentation pregnancies abortions menstrual loss must undertaken
estimates menstrual loss notoriously inaccurate routine inquiry made
female patients report menses normal unless change quantity blood loss normal menses may vary ml ml per period
therefore becomes important attempt quantify number tampons pads utilized monthly
significance black stools often appreciated patients changes bowel habits useful uncovering neoplasms colon steatorrhea even achlorhydria associated anemia
hemorrhoidal loss difficult quantify may either disregarded overestimated one patient another
obviously careful history gastrointestinal complaints might suggest gastritis peptic ulcer hiatal hernia diverticuli sought
abnormal color urine occur renal hepatic disease well hemolytic anemia
detailed dietary history important anemic patient must include foods patient eats avoids also estimate quantity
meal meal description necessary obtain appropriate estimates even patients frequently attempt mislead physician embarrassment regarding dietary idiosyncrasies financial restrictions
circumstances close concerned family member participating description diet often helpful
patients must specifically questioned regarding consumption either clay laundry starch history provided spontaneously
changes body weight important regard dietary intake suggest presence malabsorption underlying wasting disease infectious metabolic neoplastic origin
nutritional deficiencies may associated certain unusual symptoms
iron deficient patients frequently chew suck ice
occasionally complain dysphagia brittle fingernails impotence fatigue cramps calves climbing stairs proportion severity anemia
vitamin b deficiency early graying hair burning sensation tongue loss proprioception common
loss proprioception suspected patient stumbles dark must look order put either pants shoes
paresthesias unusual sensations frequently described pain also occur pernicious anemia
folate deficient patients may sore tongue cheilosis symptoms associated steatorrhea
color bulk frequency odor stools well whether feces float sink helpful suspecting malabsorption
history presence fever obtained infections neoplasms collagen vascular disease cause anemia
similarly occurrence purpura ecchymoses petechiae suggest either thrombocytopenia bleeding disorders may indication one bone marrow element affected coagulopathy cause anemia bleeding
cold intolerance important symptom hypothyroidism lupus erythematosus paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria certain macroglobulinemias
relation dark urine physical activity time day important march hemoglobinuria paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
last presence absence symptoms suggesting underlying disease cardiac hepatic renal disease chronic infection endocrinopathy malignancy sought
often physician rushes physical examination without looking patient ascertain unusual habitus appearance underdevelopment malnutrition chronic illness important clues underlying etiology disease
second skin mucous membranes often bypassed pallor abnormal pigmentation icterus spider nevi petechiae purpura angiomas ulcerations palmar erythema coarseness hair puffiness face thinning lateral aspects eyebrows nail defects unusual prominent venous pattern abdominal wall missed rush examine heart lungs
optic fundi carefully examined expense conjunctiva sclera show pallor icterus splinter hemorrhages petechiae comma signs conjunctival vessels telangiectasia helpful planning additional studies
systemic examination palpable enlargement lymph nodes must made evidence infection neoplasia
bilateral edema useful disclosing underlying cardiac renal hepatic disease whereas unilateral edema may portend lymphatic obstruction due malignancy seen palpated
careful search hepatomegaly splenomegaly undertaken
presence absence important also size kidneys liver tenderness firmness presence absence nodules
chronic disorders organs firm nontender whereas carcinoma may hard nodular
patient acute infection usually palpably softer tender organ
rectal pelvic examination neglected tumor infection organs cause anemia
neurologic examination include tests position vibratory sense well examination cranial nerves testing tendon reflexes
obviously heart size ignored enlargement may provide evidence duration severity anemia murmurs may first evidence bacterial endocarditis could explain etiology anemia
adequate history physical examination performed etiology anemia may obvious confirmatory studies appropriate therapy undertaken minimum investigation
case definite plan investigation must initiated
consider cost patient well establishing etiology abnormality
rational approach begin examination peripheral smear laboratory values obtained blood count
anemia either microcytic macrocytic certain abnormal red blood cells white cells seen peripheral smear investigative approach limited see tables
example microcytic hypochromic anemia source bleeding sought appropriate laboratory tests would either serum iron total iron binding capacity serum ferritin value stain bone marrow specimen iron
serum iron decreased total iron binding capacity increased diagnosis iron deficiency could made therapy initiated search cause iron deficiency begun
shown causes microcytic anemia listed fable
suspected order investigated could influenced findings history physical examination peripheral smear
similarly macrocytic anemia reasonable approach would determine bone marrow aspirate megaloblastic attempt appropriate laboratory studies incriminate either vitamin b folic acid deficiency
similar establishment diagnosis iron deficiency anemia diagnosis vitamin b folic acid deficiency stop abnormal laboratory value one vitamins underlying etiology must delineated
normocytic normochromic anemia encountered steps taken include categorization anemia three possible etiologies blood loss hemolysis decreased production
history appropriate physical examination search occult blood stool together evaluation status iron stores helpful excluding blood loss cause
hemolysis detected anemic patients presence indirect bilirubinemia andor reticulocytosis
first two etiologies excluded reasonable probability bone marrow biopsy obtained search causes decreased red cell production
appropriate category established sequence investigation delineate etiology becomes obvious pursued outlined
utilizing approaches diagnosis anemia clinician usually discover etiology
three causes anemia blood loss increased blood destruction decreased blood production
anemias one causes dominant factor
certain anemias however single cause may occur
example pernicious anemia predominantly due decreased production erythrocytes hemolysis adds severity anemia
many patients etiology anemia apparent organized search cause needed
examples patients known gastrointestinal hemorrhage cancer patient undergoing intensive chemotherapy
similarly anemia either microcytic macrocytic associated peculiar abnormalities shape red blood cell etiology pursued outlined
majority patients however cause obvious organized intelligent search must undertaken
best accomplished determining three causes cited operative producing anemia
obviously significant hemorrhage produce anemia
immediately blood loss hematocrit used method determine quantity blood lost patient loses plasma red blood cells
acute hemorrhage hematocrit fall several days plasma volume replaced
time anemia normocellular indices cells peripheral blood produced prior bleeding
hemorrhage sufficient deplete iron stores liters blood mg iron newly formed erythrocytes microcytic hypochromic gradually replace normal erythrocytes remaining circulation
red cell indices become abnormal months bleeding
hemorrhage body organs noticed patient
epistaxis hemoptysis hematuria sufficient degree cause anemia usually reported physician long iron deficiency ensues
however bleeding gynecologic organs gastrointestinal tract may disregarded patient go totally undetected anemia becomes profound symptomatic
menstrual bleeding variable among normal females may vary ml ml monthly mg iron
unless change observed patient menses patient relates menses normal may discourage inquiry
presence clots excessive gushing blood removal tampons use unusual number pads tampons menses used provide estimate menstrual bleeding may sufficient produce iron deficiency anemia
gastrointestinal bleeding occult cause anemia due blood loss
hemorrhage profuse usually detected evidence iron deficiency anemia occurs
bleeding occurs slowly however may remain undetected anemia ensues
every patient iron deficiency anemia stool examination occult blood
positive result signifies careful search must made gastrointestinal tract identify site bleeding
unfortunately negative result exclude gastrointestinal blood loss bleeding intermittent less ml blood stool per day may go undetected means
circumstance detection radioisotope stools patients autotransfused cr labeled red blood cells establish existence gastrointestinal bleeding
patient history physical findings often useful detecting cause gastrointestinal bleeding
symptoms suggestive hiatal hernia peptic ulcer quickly lead clinician appropriate roentgenographic studies
evidence cirrhosis liver lead careful search esophageal varices gastritis hemorrhoids addition performing barium contrast studies gastrointestinal tract
often sites gastrointestinal blood loss less evident thorough search bowel roentgenographic endoscopic methods must employed
even methods may leave source gastrointestinal bleeding undetected either detect etiology lesion small
examples include coagulation abnormalities produced aspirin platelet dysfunction hookworm infestation hemangiomas bowel lymphosarcoma tumors adenomas gallbladder self administration anticoagulants
normal red blood cell survives circulation days
erythrocytic life span shortened significantly patient hemolytic disorder may demonstrated showing either increased production erythrocytes increased destruction
former readily shown presence sustained reticulocytosis latter occurrence indirect bilirubinemia
laboratory tests available detect hemolysis either expensive less reliable
anemia solely due hemolysis occur red blood cells destroyed six eight times normal rate mean red blood cell life span less days
thus clinician relies presence anemia detect hemolytic states miss majority
contrary reticulocytosis indirect bilirubinemia used detect hemolytic states usually found mean life span less days
sophisticated methods measurements red blood cell life span required detect milder shortening erythrocyte life span days occasionally needed clinical practice
patients reticulocytosis indirect bilirubinemia hemolytic disorder
patients sustained reticulocytosis hemolytic disorder
unfortunately significant hemolysis occur without reticulocytosis bone marrow unable produce red blood cells accelerated rate pernicious anemia leukemia aplasia etc
single elevated reticulocyte count insufficient establish diagnosis hemolysis transient reticulocytosis may occur without hemolysis treatment iron deficiency anemia
patients indirect bilirubinemia hemolytic disorder
adults exception gilbert disease
presence hemolysis established etiology increased rate red blood cells sought causes hemolytic disorders either hereditary acquired
similarly either due intrinsic abnormality red blood cell intracorpuscular defect caused extrinsic causes shorten erythrocyte life span extracorpuscular table
hereditary etiologies hemolytic disease suspected patient family history anemia jaundice cholelithiasis splenectomy
whenever possible blood relatives hematologic examination hemoglobin concentration reticulocyte count indirect bilirubin determination careful examination peripheral smear
establishment hemolytic defect blood relatives permits presumptive diagnosis hereditary intravascular hemolytic disorder patient
probability hereditary hemolytic disorder established planned approach establish definitive abnormality usually simple
careful examination peripheral smear may provide important clues spherocytes ovalocytes sickle cells target cells etc
laboratory studies hereditary hemolytic disorders include incubated osmotic fragility studies spherocytes hemoglobin electrophoresis hemoglobinopathies isopropanol heat denaturation tests unstable hemoglobins oxygen dissociation curves abnormal oxygen affinity hemoglobins fetal hemoglobin determination beta thalassemia specific red blood cell enzyme assays evidence enzymatic deficiency aerobic anaerobic glycolytic pathways glucose phosphate dehydrogenase gpd deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency etc
age hemolytic disorder detected always helpful determining hereditary
congenital manifestations often unusual infants sickle cell disease beta thalassemia appear normal birth patients gpd deficiency manifestation erythrocyte enzymatic abnormality receive oxidant drug thalassemia minor usually detected routine hemogram performed often mistaken iron deficiency anemia microcytosis hypochromia
acquired hemolytic disorders occur large number diseases vary considerably severity
addition hemolysis may observed result physical injury red blood cell following exposure drugs chemicals venoms
many patients etiology hemolytic disorder apparent manifestations disease cirrhosis severe renal insufficiency hematologic malignancies burns cold exposure etc
others important clue underlying disorder infections collagen vascular disease etc
positive antiglobulin coombs test extremely helpful
provides evidence hemolytic disorder acquired extracorpuscular defect limits group disorders associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia includes drug dependent antibodies penicillin quinidine alpha methyldopa etc coexistence underlying disease hematologic malignancies lupus erythematosus certain viral infections idiopathic groups underlying disease demonstrated
usually acquired hemolytic disorders intracorpuscular defect difficult diagnose
vitamin b folic acid deficiency associated macrocytic anemia hypersegmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes peripheral smear megaloblastic bone marrow physical findings underlying deficiency state abnormal serum red cell levels deficient vitamin
iron deficiency united states rarely sufficient severity cause significant hemolysis mentioned sake completeness
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria diagnosed physician considers pancytopenia hemoglobinuria
exclusion cause hemolysis usually accomplished performance sugar water test positive confirmatory acid hemolysis test ham test
major diagnostic problem encountered hemolytic disorders occurs known causes hemolysis excluded history physical examination laboratory studies coombs test negative insufficient family members tested differentiate hereditary intracorpuscular hemolytic disorders acquired extracorpuscular defects
donor cell cr red blood cell survival study provide differentiation
labeled red blood cells normal blood donor compatible blood group normal survival patients hereditary hemolytic disease shortened life span acquired extracorpuscular defect
differentiation important determining prognosis selecting appropriate therapy
diminished production red cells suspected patients without evidence either blood loss hemolysis
thus anemia patient without evidence bleeding iron deficiency normal indirect bilirubin normal decreased reticulocyte count probably defect production erythrocytes
many patients pancytopenia abnormalities leukocytes platelets detected examination peripheral smear
group disorders suspected important laboratory test bone marrow biopsy aspirate
bone marrow biopsy permit categorization disorders three separate groups aplasia hypoplasia hyperplasia bone marrow replaced nonhematopoietic elements table
aplastic hypoplastic disorders commonly caused drugs chemicals
certain causative agents dosage related whereas others idiosyncratic
human exposed sufficient dose inorganic arsenic benzene radiation usual chemotherapeutic agents employed treatment neoplastic disease develop bone marrow depression pancytopenia
idiosyncratic agents produce suppression one formed elements bone marrow small percentage exposed people
certain drugs pancytopenia common whereas others suppression one cell line usually observed
idiosyncratic causes aplasia viral hepatitis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
definite etiology established half aplastic patients disorder must classified idiopathic
whenever possible cause aplastic anemia sought cessation exposure may lead recovery
rarer causes anemia due hypoplastic bone marrow include familial disorders acquired pure red cell aplasias
latter characterized virtual absence erythroid precursors bone marrow normal numbers granulocytic precursors megakaryocytes
patients hyperplastic bone marrow decreased production red blood cells group excellent prognosis unresponsive group refractory therapy relatively poor prognosis
former includes disorders relative bone marrow failure due nutritional deficiency proper treatment either vitamin b folic acid iron leads correction anemia appropriate etiology established
drugs act antifolic antagonists inhibit dna synthesis produce similar effects
second group includes idiopathic hyperplasia may partially respond pyridoxine therapy pharmacologic doses frequently
patients frequently ring sideroblasts bone marrow indicating inappropriate utilization iron mitochondria
certain patients may refractory anemia years eventually develop acute leukemia
rare causes diminished erythrocyte production hyperplastic bone marrow include hereditary orotic aminoaciduria erythremic myelosis
last infiltration bone marrow fibrous tissue neoplastic cells cells replace normal hematopoietic tissue diminish production red blood cells granulocytes platelets
diagnosis myelofibrosis neoplastic involvement bone marrow often suspected evidence myeloid metaplasia peripheral smear
replacement bone marrow nonhematopoietic cells leads activation fetal sites blood production organs liver spleen release abnormally shaped erythrocytes normoblasts immature granulocytes large platelets peripheral blood
myeloid metaplasia occur aplastic disease
thus presence anemic patient lead suspicion bone marrow infiltration even biopsy specimen obtained
