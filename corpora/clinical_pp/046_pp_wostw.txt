skin testing tuberculosis tb utilizes form diagnostic reagent tuberculin
multiple puncture technique referred heaf tine test whereas purified protein derivative ppd commonly administered intradermal injection called mantoux technique charles mantoux described technique early part twentieth century
old tuberculin used clinically multiple puncture technique
ppd also used systems multiple puncture standard ppd solution never used multiple puncture technique concentration standardized technique
multiple puncture systems ppd designed system used
ppd occasionally administered first strength tu second strength tu equivalent concentration ot
clinical utility first second strength tuberculin poorly defined
intermediate strength ppd remains best studied
ppd even stabilized tween sensitive light certain extent temperature
thus stored refrigerator
multiple puncture technique uses either applicator coated dried tuberculin reagent similar device coated liquid tuberculin immediately application
heaf technique uses injector
applicator pressed skin
reaction read hours
discrete papules present diameter largest recorded
vesiculation occurs recorded separately considered positive test
papules coalesce diameter largest area induration recorded
although multiple puncture technique found favor screening tool positive result confirmed mantoux testing unless vesiculation taken place
thus mantoux testing procedure choice
mantoux testing advantage using standard amount standard potency reagent thus quantifiable reproducible
utility mantoux technique largely function skill person administering test thus delegated least experienced least trained member medical care team
goal procedure deliver precisely
ml ppd intradermally
subcutaneous administration result rapid washout area without time development reaction
superficial injection results leakage reagent onto skin delivery less tu intradermally
injection performed using tuberculin syringe made either glass plastic less half inch needle either gauge
location injection may anywhere traditionally volar dorsal surface forearm sufficiently far superficial veins chosen
skin thickness varies spot chosen repeat test
skin prepared alcohol swab
needle bevel upward skin punctured shallowly mm tense wheal raised upon injection
ml
injection unsuccessful may repeated immediately usually arm figure
traditionally test read hours although positive reactions persist several days following day period
large reactions may endure week
positive reaction usually includes induration skin surrounding erythema
erythema diagnostic significance ignored
induration measured precisely millimeters transverse dimension
several methods determining precise degree induration
lesion may stroked fingertip marking point skin raised
area induration appears merge surrounding normal skin examination lesion light shined obliquely across skin delineate degree induration
common mistake record results simply negative positive
allow comparison reaction subsequent measurements
description tuberculin robert koch waning years nineteenth century one classics infectious diseases
although originally thought treatment tuberculosis substance found use diagnostic reagent
despite nearly years clinical use however tuberculin tuberculin reaction remain shrouded mystery
tuberculin mixture antigens derived mycobacterium tuberculosis available two forms
old tuberculin ot prepared heating broth culture
tuberculosis filtering
seibert glenn described batch preparation purified protein derivative ot called ppd
potency ppd measured tuberculin units tu reflect reactivity weight per unit volume compared seibert lot international standard deposit bureau biologics u
national institutes health statens serum institute copenhagen denmark
activity ppd measured phosphate buffered solution although commercially substance stabilized detergent tween prevent adsorption active principle glass containers syringes
standard ppd dose tu per
ml
ppd reaction exploits delayed type hypersensitivity reaction patient previously infected mycobacteria
positive reaction correlated histologically presence mononuclear cells site injection
influx begins within hours usually complete hours
although pathogenesis reaction completely understood appears require release lymphokines skin subsequent attraction uncommitted mononuclear cells area
thus predominant cells present tuberculin reaction previously sensitized tuberculosis
characteristic erythema edema tuberculin reaction thought secondary increase vascular permeability consequent inflammatory reaction
although erythema may occur early within first hours confused tuberculin reaction erythema generally subsides thought secondary immediate type hypersensitivity response contaminants reagent
regardless method even contention tuberculin reaction epiphenomenon correlation tuberculin reaction tuberculosis disputed
validity tuberculin reaction diagnosing tuberculosis hinges meaning positive negative test
even definition two seemingly simple concepts produces vigorous debate
official statement tuberculin skin test american thoracic society offers definitions become standards although debate continues
definition reactions tuberculin rests epidemiologic data
reaction mantoux test may divided two groups false positive true positive
purposes discussion true positive one accurately predicts infection previous exposure mycobacterium tuberculosis
thus false positive may well delayed type hypersensitivity reaction ppd concomitant histologic immunologic features associated infection
tuberculosis
although data sparse investigation difficult perform consensus common false positive tuberculin reaction caused infection mycobacteriae tuberculosis mott
although infections mott widespread contribution human disease small comparison
tuberculosis
mycobacterium kansasii cause pulmonary disease indistinguishable caused
tuberculosis
mycobacterium avium complex cause chronic pulmonary infection disseminated disease seen acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids
rule mott causing pulmonary disease clustered geographically
also generally speaking tuberculin reaction caused infection mott tends smaller elicited infection
tuberculosis
thus criteria positivity tuberculin reaction must take geography account
would seem ideal population determine diameter positive test one bacteriologic evidence tuberculosis
however studies performed tuberculosis sanatoriums reported nash douglas showed patients active pulmonary tuberculosis failed respond tu ppd greater mm induration
patients part anergic skin test antigens thus specific inhibitor ppd reactivity posited exist
skin test reactivity known return patients concomitant treatment acute phase diagnostic test false negative test ppd significant
false negative test results procedure fails yield positive result presence phenomenon designed detect
besides inhibitor described previously causes false negative intermediate strength ppd include concurrent viral infections rubella rubeola well bacterial infections including brucellosis typhoid fever
live virus vaccines measles shown inhibit development positive test
reticuloendothelial malignancy steroid therapy likewise thought decrease tuberculin reactivity
sarcoidosis appears older lists causing tuberculin negativity
return tuberculin positivity even thought signal quiescence sarcoid
sarcoid patients general tuberculin positivity tuberculosis although correlation well established patients without sarcoid
psychological factors also shown influence tuberculin reactivity
correctable cause tuberculin false negativity improper storage administration reagent improper interpretation test
failure positive controls yield high concordance test epidemiologic methods need considered establish cut point positive test
ideally data would yield clear bimodal distribution yet case
previously alluded geographic variation skin test reactivity blurs region positive negative test many areas
effort analyze relative contributions mott tuberculin reactivity populations surveys conducted navy recruits using multiple antigens including ppd ppd b prepared battey bacillus
intracellulare ppd g gause strain
scrofulaceum histoplasmin
reactors ppd b tended mm reactions ppd
important found risk developing tuberculosis increased size ppd reaction
numerous subsequent studies shown mott skin test antigens useful epidemiological studies applied diagnosis individual patients
thus appears ppd must interpreted geographically
course clinical history important
patients radiographic evidence pulmonary tuberculosis previous history close contact tuberculosis case likely bimodal distribution patients tuberculin negativity assumed test diameter less mm
give small false negative rate
general population without evidence tuberculosis exposure cut point mm seems acceptable
areas endemic mott higher cut point perhaps mm could considered
summary lowering cut point reduce number people tuberculosis missed testing e false negatives
expense however including people called positive tests disease e false positives
converse true raising cut point false negative rate increased
since one values mantoux test identification new infections called converters valuable know ppd sensitizing
delayed type hypersensitivity tuberculin established whatever means may decrease advancing age well temporal distance exposure tuberculosis
people may insignificant tuberculin reaction initially tested yet convert retesting
termed booster effect
presence boosted reactors population may yield inordinately high conversion rate recognized
booster phenomenon observed short time week bass serio others suggested repeat skin testing short detection insignificant reaction identify boost positive range eliminate consideration converters subsequent testing periods
repeat test falls positive range person managed manner routine positive reaction individual clinical situation
previous vaccination bcg may also cause false positive reading
however variable reaction also wanes time
bcg recipient positive tuberculin reaction therefore evaluated received vaccine
despite variability multiple caveats attendant mantoux testing ppd carries enormous clinical utility
american thoracic society suggests following list persons tuberculin testing indicated
persons signs e g radiographic abnormality andor symptoms cough hemoptysis weight loss etc
suggestive current tuberculosis disease
recent contacts known tuberculosis cases persons suspected tuberculosis
persons abnormal chest roentgenograms compatible past tuberculosis
persons medical conditions increase risk tuberculosis silicosis gastrectomy diabetes immunosuppressive therapy lymphomas etc
groups high risk recent infection
tuberculosis immigrants asia africa latin america oceania inner city skid row populations personnel long term residents hospitals nursing homes mental institutions prisons
present testing second strength tuberculin appear useful likely yield false positive cross reactivity uncover covert reactor
two stage testing intermediate strength ppd exploit booster phenomenon probably useful situation
epidemiological study efficacy tuberculosis control population tuberculin screening may useful
however general situation area low endemicity united states population screening likely complicated cross reactivity booster phenomenon
