hematuria blood urine
hematuria termed gross macroscopic sufficient blood present color urine red brown
hematuria termed microscopic urine visually normal color found contain blood chemical analysis microscopic evaluation
evaluation patient hematuria begin careful history
pattern hematuria associated symptoms elicited e gross vs
microscopic constant vs
intermittent painless vs
painful
important historical findings include fever back pain dysuria urgency frequency urinary tract infection renal colic previous nephrolithiasis renal stone disease weight loss especially abdominal pain renal cell carcinoma weight loss significant smoking history analgesic abuse exposure industrial dyes bladder carcinoma recent sore throat skin infection edema hypertension glomerulonephritis recent back abdominal urethral injury vigorous exercise trauma history heart murmur recent dental genitourinary manipulation endocarditis history bleeding sites previous bleeding disorder family history bleeding disorder systemic coagulopathy
careful drug history taken special attention analgesics papillary necrosis cyclophosphamide hemorrhagic cystitis anticoagulants drugs known cause acute interstitial nephritis see table
personal family history hematuria deafness ocular abnormalities alport syndrome hematuria progressive chronic renal failure polycystic kidney disease sought well family history sickle hemoglobin
finally careful travel history obtained schistosoma haematobium common cause hematuria certain endemic areas
physical examination vital signs checked special attention blood pressure temperature
skin examined carefully rash ecchymoses petechiae
lens abnormalities hearing loss noted
cardiac murmurs rales costovertebral angle tenderness abdominal tenderness abdominal masses important findings
genital examination include investigation possible sites bleeding around urethral meatus sexes vaginal bleeding female
history physical examination complete careful urinalysis performed physician
number substances blood may color urine red including porphyrins phenazopyridine pyridium beets free hemoglobin myoglobin
addition standard dipstick using orthotoluidine reagent detect blood positive presence either free hemoglobin myoglobin
therefore hematuria confirmed presence red blood cells microscopic examination
documenting hematuria present careful search urinary abnormalities helpful
presence proteinuria suggests renal parenchymal etiology quantified timed urine collection
urine protein excretion greater g hr virtually diagnostic renal parenchymal disease
urine protein excretion less g hr helpful differential diagnosis may due simply presence serum proteins accompany hematuria protein released red cells lysed
white cells white cell casts may accompany red cells infectious noninfectious inflammation e g acute interstitial nephritis acute glomerulonephritis
red blood cell casts diagnostic renal etiology hematuria usually glomerular origin
crystals may seen patients nephrolithiasis many types crystals may also present urine patients without renal stones
addition complete urinalysis complete blood count serum electrolytes blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine obtained
patients evidence infection urine culture obtained
suspicion coagulation disturbance prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time bleeding time checked
black patients screened presence sickle hemoglobin high prevalence hematuria patients sickle trait
history renal colic kidneyureterbladder examination performed look renal stone followed excretory urography appropriate
history suggestive malignancy cystoscopy performed evaluate bladder tumors abdominal computerized tomography renal arteriography done renal tumor suspected
obvious source apparent initial evaluation excretory urography done
cystoscopy performed patients gross hematuria findings suggestive lower tract source bleeding older men
efficacy routine cystoscopy asymptomatic microscopic hematuria women men age questioned probably warranted routine basis
skin test tuberculosis placed positive first voided morning urine specimens mycobacterial culture obtained three different occasions rule genitourinary tuberculosis
evaluation nondiagnostic evidence renal parenchymal disease nephrologic consultation obtained consideration percutaneous renal biopsy
red blood cells may excreted urine normal persons
known precisely cells reach urinary tract
however normal excretion rate
million rbcs hr less rbcshpf microscopic examination spun urine specimen
difficult localize site bleeding routine examination patient hematuria
however certain findings may helpful
example casts form lumina renal tubules
therefore presence red blood cell casts localizes site bleeding renal parenchyma
red cell morphology examined phase contrast microscopy may also helpful red cells glomerular origin tend distorted variation size shape
thought result red cells passage nephron
contrast red cells nonglomerular origin generally maintain uniform size characteristic shape
red blood cell size distribution curves measured automated analyzer may also reflect distortion red cells occurs traverse nephron
glomerular hematuria urinary rbcs irregular size distribution tend smaller peripheral rbcs
nonglomerular hematuria urinary rbcs uniform size distribution larger mean volume peak volume greater peripheral rbcs
hematuria may caused large number diverse disease processes life threatening
however number clinical studies shown incidence serious diseases manifest hematuria adequate magnitude justify investigation virtually patients
despite careful evaluation approximately patients apparent cause found generally excellent prognosis
