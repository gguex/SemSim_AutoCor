inspection palpation external genitalia includes penis urethral meatus scrotum scrotal contents
inspection palpation external genitalia initially performed patient standing disrobed front seated examiner
repeat examination carried patient supine
visual scanning hair distribution general appearance penis scrotum made
large scrotal masses undescended testes inguinal bulges hernia frequently apparent inspection
entire penis examined
patient uncircumcised prepuce retracted entire glans inspected
palpation penile shaft including corpora cavernosa corpus spongiosum carried
urethral meatus visualized everted examiner thumbs expose mucosa
entire pendulous urethra palpated without difficulty bulbous urethra palpated scrotum perineum
palpation scrotum contents reveal presence size position shape testicles adnexa
normal testicle ovoid smooth firm mildly tender palpation
testicle easily separated epididymis lies posterior slightly lateral testicle
epididymis varies adherence posterolateral surface testicle
masses scrotum transilluminated dark room small strong light source
undescended testicle may located inguinal abdominal region palpation areas imperative testes absent
course spermatic cord followed easily internal inguinal ring palpation
vas deferens felt scrotum first encircling cord fingers thumb allowing small amounts cord tissue pass thumb second third fingers thick cordlike vas felt
experience practice provide expertise examining genitalia especially scrotal contents normal subjects
even experienced examiner however use exploratory surgery definitive diagnosis many cases
noted chapter many abnormalities apparent inspection e g large scrotal masses hypospadias epispadias
however early penile carcinomas condylomas may reside unnoticed coronal sulcus unless foreskin retracted
inability retract foreskin phimosis may cause hygienic problems voiding symptoms
examination urethral meatus may reveal stenosis lesions condylomas
peyronie disease palpation corpora reveals characteristic dense fibrous plaque
often thickened periurethral fibrosis urethral stricture disease felt either penile shaft perineum
scrotal masses difficult lesions differentiate inspection palpation
varicoceles usually occur left postpubertal men bag worms feel
disappear become less apparent patient recumbent position
hydroceles spermatic cord testicles cystic readily transilluminate light
presence hydrocele testicle frequently poorly felt except posteriorly
testes may small following mumps orchids hypogonadal states
masses located within testes usually tumors require surgical evaluation
epididymitis common inflammatory disease scrotum occasionally difficult distinguish testicular tumors testicular torsion
epididymitis favored testicular torsion presence concomitant urinary infection prostatitis funiculitis inflammation spermatic cord toxic clinical state
acute surgical exploration recommended diagnosis testicular torsion versus epididymitis question
differentiation testicular tumor epididymitis difficult brief trial period appropriate antibiotic therapy urine culture sensitivity possible may instituted
resolution scrotal mass symptoms epididymitis likely source
without resolution surgical exploration mandatory
lesions spermatic cord usually inflammatory cystic
spermatoceles small structures occur head epididymis
diagnosis confirmed transillumination demonstrated aspiration yields viable spermatozoa
