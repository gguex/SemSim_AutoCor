tell patient going test ability feel touch pain face
eyes shut
take piece cotton ball finger
lightly touch either one sides three divisions trigeminal
ask patient show say whether touched one sides face
next take safety pin gently prick first one side division asking patient difference sensation one side compared
patient eyes closed touch sometimes sharp point pin times dull guard
ask patient describe sensation
test corneal reflex
begin telling patient going touch eye gently order check reflex
take wisp cotton twist point
ask patient look direction testing blink reflex
gently firmly touch cornea junction sclera
sensitivity pain increases medially point decreases laterally
junction cornea sclera good compromise causing pain patient obtaining reflex

peripheral lesions involving sensory portion trigeminal point distal pontine exit produce ipsilateral pain andor varying degrees anesthesia
distribution lesion course determine symptoms findings
etiologies selby
peripheral lesions craniofacial trauma basilar skull features dental trauma maxillary sinusitis primary metastatic tumors aneurysm internal carotid artery cavernous sinus thrombosis stilbamidine trichlorethylene lupus scleroderma sj√∏gren syndrome sarcoidosis probably amyloidosis fairly common idiopathic benign sensory neuropathy
horner syndrome produced lesions nasociliary nerve runs ophthalmic division
lesions ganglion herpes zoster infection primary metastatic tumors
trigeminal root lesions adjacent tumors vascular malformations especially acoustic neurinoma cholesteatomas
lesions prone produce facial pain often misdiagnosed tic douloureux tooth pain
vascular lesions tumors congenital malformations syringobulbia syringomyelia common causes central lesions
lesions sensory cortex produce raised threshold anesthesia pain temperature opposite side face
thalamic lesions produce contralateral hypesthesia hyperpathia face
midpontine lesions unilateral produce ipsilateral decrease tactile sensation face due involvement main sensory nucleus ipsilateral paralysis masticatory muscles motor nucleus involved
anesthesia hypesthesia ipsilaterally seen pontine lesion involves entering sensory root fibers carrying pain temperature modalities
pons ipsilateral pain temperature lost spinal tract nucleus involved
ventral trigeminal tract carrying crossed pain temperature fibers involved loss modalities occurs opposite side face
helpful generalizations central trigeminal lesions given table
tic douloureux trigeminal neuralgia relatively frequent cause facial pain
paroxysmal pain great intensity involves trigeminal division
pain frequent maxillary mandibular division
pain lasts seconds minutes set blast cold hot air shaving combing hair similar stimulus
