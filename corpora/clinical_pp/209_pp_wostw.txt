carefully obtained detailed history invaluable evaluation febrile conditions

fevers persist become fevers undetermined origin careful detailed history physical examination clinician valuable tools
must performed repeatedly throughout evaluation
repeated questioning may reveal information deemed pertinent patient initial evaluation
questioning relative friend former physician quite enlightening
physical examination particular attention given skin lesions funduscopic changes organomegaly nails lymph nodes heart auscultation genitalia rectal examination
physical findings may change dramatically hospitalization meticulous repetition may reveal needed information
patient fever undetermined origin vague trivial complaints minor physical findings often important

fever recognized one hallmarks clinical disease since ancient times
accurate recording body temperature became possible eighteenth century dutch inventor farenheit introduced thermometer

fever accompanies infectious well noninfectious diseases holds central role definition pathogenesis heat related illnesses heat stroke
pathogenesis pathophysiology purpose fever becoming well delineated
fevers caused infection although many disease states responsible e g central nervous system lesions neoplasms endocrine abnormalities connective tissue diseases
febrile states secondary disordered thermoregulation like seen hypothalamic lesions due release endogenous pyrogen
endogenous pyrogen ep acts receptors thermoregulatory hypothalamus cause fever
fever production may mediated increase local prostaglandin pge production monoamines cations sodium calcium cyclic adenosine monophosphate
exogenous stimuli ep release source monocytes liver spleen lung macrophages keratinocytes polymorphonuclear cells vascular endothelial smooth muscle cells kidney mesangial cells include lipopolysaccharide endotoxin gram negative rods viruses bacterial products fungi etiocholanolone antigen antibody complexes polynucleotides antigens
viruses tumors hypersensitivity reactions drugs substances may stimulate ep release monocytes indirectly via lymphokines secreted interaction sensitized lymphocytes
recently discovered actually three endogenous pyrogens mediate feverinterleukin il tumor necrosis factor tnf cachetin interferon
il identical lymphocyte activating factor laf addition inducing fever modulates large number host defense responses including mitogenic action lymphocytes results increased generation helper cells reduction plasma iron zinc concentrations neutrophilia increases acute phase plasma proteins
since many organisms require iron growth fall available plasma iron detriment potentially great benefit host
tnf similar il many properties activate lymphocytes

evaporation heat loss requires intact sweating mechanism well hypothalamic input
ambient air temperature becomes °c higher neither conduction radiation effective
high humidity limits heat loss vaporization
although cause fever often evident history physical examination initial laboratory radiologic studies sorting myriad causes organized approach formidable task clinician
approach directed well thought
clinical usefulness fever patterns dubious although notable exceptions
five patterns intermittent remittent continuous sustained hectic relapsing
intermittent fever temperature elevated falls normal °c day remittent fever temperature falls day normal
two patterns amplitude temperature change °c less °c
either two patterns called hectic difference peak trough temperature great °c
sustained fever pattern little change °c less elevated temperature hour period
relapsing fever variant intermittent pattern fever spikes separated days weeks intervening normal temperature
although diagnostic times fever curves suggestive
hectic fevers wide swings temperature often associated chills sweats
pattern thought suggestive abscess pyogenic infection pyelonephritis ascending cholangitis may also seen tuberculosis hypernephromas lymphomas drug reactions
continuous sustained fever usually associated true chills rigors
characteristic typhoid fever typhus although commonly seen bacterial endocarditis tuberculosis fungal disease bacterial pneumonia
noninfectious etiologies include neoplasms connective tissue disease drug fever
relapsing fevers may seen rat bite fever malaria cholangitis infections borrelia recurrentis hodgkin disease pel ebstein fever neoplasms
historically diseases described characteristic fever patterns
double quotidian fever gonococcal endocarditis two spikes hour period
fever hour intervals suggests plasmodium vivax p
ovale hour intervals suggest p
malariae p
falciparum often unsynchronized intermittent fever
fevers follow usual diurnal pattern
disseminated tuberculosis typhoid fever polyarteritis nodosa important exceptions reversal usual diurnal pattern typhus inversus pattern observed
reversed pattern also seen old age salicylate ingestion
contrary widely held beliefs height temperature elevation little diagnostic significance
although thermoregulatory defects certainly thought temperatures exceed °c infection either alone coexisting thermoregulatory defect found patients extreme °c greater pyrexia
drug fevers also may exceed °c may simulate septicemia
