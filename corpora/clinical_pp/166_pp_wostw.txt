joint fluid transudate plasma actively secreted synovial cells
provides nutrients lubrication articular cartilage
examination joint fluid focuses properties constituents value determining cause effusions
definitive diagnosis joint fluid findings made two situations crystal synovitis septic arthritis
conditions correlation joint fluid analysis clinical information useful arriving diagnosis
routine joint fluid analysis
therefore responsibility examining physician record gross description fluid volume color clarity viscosity
minimum white blood cell count differential microscopic examination polarized light crystals gram stain bacteriologic cultures done
glucose protein ordered sufficient fluid
special cultures chemistries may indicated unusual circumstances
mucin clot test done adds little viscosity white blood cell count differential measure inflammation
recent studies shown considerable variation various laboratories consider routine accuracy reports
consequently prudent specify desired tests rather simply request routine analysis
physician develop facility performing interpreting microscopic examination event laboratory always immediately accessible laboratory report questioned
following materials available aspiration performed
betadine solution skin preparation alcohol swabs remove iodine puncture site lidocaine local anesthesia sterile syringes anesthesia cc gauge needle aspiration cc gauge needles heparin solution flushing larger syringes prior aspiration collecting tubes sterile culture tube fluoride gray top tube glucose plain lavender top tubes blood count chemistries glass slides cover slip band aid optional clear nail polish sealing edges cover slip
ml fluid obtained apportioned follows
smaller amount fluid obtained first drops go culture tube
one drop spread one glass slides gram stain another drop placed slide crystal examination covered cover slip
edges may sealed clear nail polish slide examined immediately
viscosity checked observing length string formed syringe pulled away slide
normal fluid form string cm length breaking
remaining fluid may placed appropriate tube sent complete blood count differential tests deemed useful
cell counts crystal examination performed fluid days old refrigerated though cell loss
chemistry determinations done promptly else fluid centrifuged supernatant refrigerated
examine crystals wet mount placed polarizing microscope cells particulate matter brought focus low power
high dry magnification estimate cell count proportion polymorphonuclear cells pmn ascertained
light reduced condenser often possible see crystals present
polarizer analyzer disc turned field becomes dark
birefringent crystals appear light dark background
although monosodium urate crystals typically long needle shaped one rely morphology identification
moving red compensator light path produce blue yellow color birefringent particles
reference arrow inscribed either analyzer compensator plate allows identification crystals
common convention among house officers word brag blue crystal right angles reference arrow gout likely crystal monosodium urate
slide rotated degrees another urate crystal found parallel reference arrow crystal yellow
calcium pyrophosphate crystals give opposite color changes yellow perpendicular arrow blue parallel
color intensity calcium crystals less urate crystals gatter contains excellent color plates crystals particles cells identified microscopically
polarizing microscope available crystals seen drop
n naoh added slide
urate crystals dissolve
drop freshly filtered alizarin red added drop fluid another slide calcium crystals type appear orange microscope
heparin used aspirating syringe green top tube sodium heparin suitable crystal analysis
tubes containing lithium heparin oxalate anticoagulants used since crystals resembling urate calcium may form
iodine skin prep may also introduce crystals removed puncture sites
anticoagulant necessary since inflammatory fluid may clot yield falsely low white blood cell count
saline
used dilute fluid white blood cell count standard acetic acid diluting fluid cause fluid clot
lidocaine may suppress bacterial growth therefore anesthetizing syringe needle used aspiration
monosodium urate crystals show intense negative birefringence
betamethasone crystals also negatively birefringent used standard reference slide novice
unfortunately steroid recently injected aspirated joint may confuse interpretation
calcium salts including oxalate used anticoagulant collecting tubes positively birefringent lithium heparin steroid crystals
artifacts dust
talc nail polish show variable birefringence
calcium hydroxyapatite crystals tiny therefore difficult identify wet mount however clumps stain purple wright stain orange alizarin red
synovial fluid secreted synovial cells lining joint capsule articular cartilage
synovial lining continuous lacks basement membrane
subsynovial layer contains lymphatics blood vessels supported fibrous joint capsule
therefore erythocytes usually seen arthrocentesis secondary either capillary trauma underlying disease
selected components synovial fluid usually undergo predictable changes depending pathophysiologic processes table
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions transparent fine print usually read test tube fluid
clarity changes transparent opaque direct proportion number leukocytes enter fluid inflammation infection
minimal inflammation capillary leakage red cells metabolism hemoglobin bilirubin fluid may become xanthochromic
color also affected presence leukocytes bacteria pus white
example staphylococcus aureus may produce golden hue
bloody red fluid may due trauma causes hemarthrosis
less blood cause joint fluid look like whole blood hence simultaneous serum synovial hematocrit may necessary determine amount blood present
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions contains significant amount mgdl hyaluronic acid high molecular weight polymerized glycosaminoglycan responsible unique eggwhite like consistency high viscosity joint fluid
inflammatory combined inflammatory infectious processes hyaluronate may fragmented proteolytic action lysozymes released polymorphonuclear cells pmns
results decreased concentration low viscosity
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions contains white blood cells predominantly monocytes lymphocytes macrophages pmns
inflammatory infectious conditions tuberculosis viral disease fraction pmns increases proportion increases total synovial fluid leukocyte count total leukocyte count increases proportion extent inflammation infection
consequently major basis classifying synovial effusion quantification leukocytes table
leukocyte counts vary wide range overlap groups due variability mechanisms producing joint fluid table
even specific disease rheumatoid arthritis leukocyte count vary mm depending activity joint disease
combined pathophysiologic processes may make interpretation leukocyte count difficult
example patients noninflammatory process hemochromatosis may significantly higher expected leukocyte counts associated inflammatory process crystal induced arthritis also present
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions usually contain crystals unless crystal induced arthritis quiescent state unless nonpathogenetic crystals cholesterol artifacts previously injected corticosteroid esters present
two predominant crystals produce synovial inflammation monosodium urate monohydrate msu gout calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate cppd pseudogout
although fundamental mechanism crystal induced formation synovial fluid unclear association crystals inflammatory response well documented
example rare find crystals without neutrophils neutrophils without crystals acute episodes
less frequently seen monocytes synovial cells phagocytizing crystals
whether intracellular extracellular crystals appear needlelike msu rhomboid cppd yet may appear blunt rods
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions usually maintains glucose level close within mgdl serum concentration glucose enters synovia blood facilitated diffusion equilibration
synovial serum difference reliable fasting state equilibration slow unpredictable meal
inflammatory infectious conditions synovial glucose often reduced result utilization metabolic activity neutrophils bacteria
joint fluid normal noninflammatory conditions contains one fourth total protein present blood
coagulation proteins absent hence normal joint fluid clot
smaller molecules albumin usually present greater concentrations larger molecules globulins
inflammatory conditions however concentration components may equal plasma concentrations increased synovial blood flow
synovial fluid protein levels greater
gdl abnormal greater
gdl indicate significant inflammation
inflammatory effusions gram stain culture mandatory rule septic joint well infection superimposed another condition rheumatoid arthritis
lack basement membrane makes synovium susceptible site infection presence bacteremia
components immune system antinuclear antibodies igg igm rheumatoid factors total hemolytic complement usually parallel changes serum andor nonspecific
nonspecific synovial fluid measurements associated processes include decreased ph inflammation increased lactic acid nongonococcal septic arthritis lysozymelactoferrin ratio extent inflammation name
none tests however routinely ordered synovial fluid
analysis joint fluid yields definitive diagnosis two situations septic arthritis crystal induced synovitis
septic arthritis emergency pyogenic infection destroy joint appropriate therapy initiated within days
purulent fluid group iii mandates antibiotic therapy even gram stain negative
synovial fluid gram stains positive less cases gonococcal arthritis positive synovial fluid culture obtained cases
gram stain positive cases gram negative bacillary staphylococcal infections respectively cultures almost always positive
cultures may spuriously negative synovial fluid contains lidocaine patient received earlier antibiotic therapy
gram stain yield improved centrifuged sediment obtained
group ii fluid sometimes obtained septic arthritis
may occur fluid removed early course disease patient taking antibiotics patient immunocompromised fluid taken adjacent bursa rather joint space
indolent effusions minimal discomfort inflammation suggest tuberculous fungal cause
appropriate cultures andor synovial biopsy indicated cases
presence monosodium urate calcium crystals inflammatory fluid especially crystals intracellular warrants diagnosis crystal induced synovitis
crystal synovitis however exclude concomitant infection
therefore gram stain culture must still done
furthermore calcium urate crystals may present joint fluid example patient chondrocalcinosis may gout patient gout may secondary calcium deposits adjacent tophus
artifacts use wrong anticoagulant prior steroid injections may misleading see technique
calcium pyrophosphate crystal associated synovitis chondrocalcinosis pseudogout
chondrocalcinosis may hereditary related osteoarthritis hyperparathyroidism hemochromatosis hypothyroidism gout acromegaly ochronosis hypophosphatasia hypomagnesemia
calcium salts pyrophosphate associated synovitis
hydroxyapatite crystals associated osteoarthritis erosive arthropathy
calcium oxalate crystals found synovial effusions patients undergoing hemodialysis
presence bacterial infection synovial fluid glucose may least mgdl lower simultaneous blood glucose providing patient fasting
rheumatoid effusions may also show low glucose
synovial fluid protein rises proportional degree synovial inflammation
rise nonspecific adds clinically useful information beyond obtained white cell count differential
synovial fluid lactic acid levels suggested quick method identifying septic joint
lactic acid levels appear proportional white blood cell count however therefore greater specificity white blood cell count
synovial fluid viscosity falls proportion degree inflammation low viscosity fluid low white blood cell count suggests technical error performing cell count
occur long delay performing cell count clotting fluid
extremely viscous fluid may found myxedematous patient
conclusion valuable diagnostic information obtained analysis joint fluid
standard aseptic technique employed likelihood introducing infection rare
sterile gloves mask absolutely necessary
therefore physician hesitate obtain joint fluid analysis evaluating unexplained joint effusion
joint fluid analysis essential evaluation patient acute monoarthritis
