pain abdomen single important symptom acute abdominal pathologic process
symptom brings patient physician symptom deserves utmost care evaluation
said skilled clinician identify source abdominal pain history alone time
achieve goal requires thorough understanding pathogenesis many abdominal diseases produce pain pathways transmitted
imperative analyze abdominal pain particular emphasis six features onset progression migration character intensity localization
abdominal pain may sudden rapid gradual onset
pain sudden onset occurs within second
patient relate time onset precise moment usually stating exactly activity going time pain began
sudden onset pain commonly associated perforation gastrointestinal tract gastric duodenal ulcer colonic diverticulum foreign body
common causes include ruptured ectopic pregnancy mesenteric infarction ruptured aortic aneurysm embolism abdominal vessel
pain rapid onset begins seconds steadily increases severity next several minutes
patient recall time onset general without precision noted pain sudden onset
pain rapid onset associated cholecystitis pancreatitis intestinal obstruction diverticulitis appendicitis ureteral stone penetrating gastric duodenal ulcer
pain gradual onset pain slowly becomes severe number hours even days elapsed
patient memory time onset pain vague pinpoint day possibly week onset
pain gradual onset commonly associated neoplasms chronic inflammatory processes large bowel obstruction
many intra abdominal conditions associated pain gradual onset making accurate diagnosis history difficult symptom pain sudden rapid onset
real diagnostic significance determine progression pain interval time onset patient seeks medical attention
pain abated increased
intervals total absence pain pain always present changing character
information clinician may able example identify perforated ulcer produced pain sudden onset subsequently abates dramatically perforation seals leak occurs
intermittent attacks abdominal pain progress steady constant ache suggest small bowel obstruction vascular compromise lead grave complication necrosis involved incarcerated bowel
pain shifts original site onset another location abdomen often associated acute appendicitis periumbilical epigastric pain visceral present early course disease replaced right lower quadrant somatic pain later illness parietal peritoneum becomes involved inflammatory process
pain produced irritation parietal peritoneum duodenal contents leaking perforated duodenal ulcer may begin epigastrum may migrate lower quadrants abdomen pelvis depending pathway leaking material takes abdominal cavity
determining character kind pain patient experiencing prime importance discovering pathologic process responsible
since patient description pain must purely subjective essential clinician patient communicate clearly precise character pain identified
patient usually need help doctor describing pain suggesting similarities comparisons hunger pain burning pain sticking pain
especially important presence absence cramping pain established
term cramp many interpretations patient need example cramplike pain leaves room misinterpretation
one example liken pain wringing washcloth intense pain corresponding wringing washcloth abating washcloth untwisted
abdominal pain characterized cramping dull aching either constant intermittent
cramping abdominal pain characterized pain increases intensity short waves maximum abruptly ceases period complete absence pain
repetition pain occurs intervals
type pain associated mechanical small bowel obstruction clearly present pathognomonic condition
interval cramping pain helps locate site obstruction short pain free intervals proximal obstructions longer pain free intervals distal obstruction
constant dull aching abdominal pain usually caused distention edema wall hollow viscus
pain stretch capsule liver spleen may also perceived dull aching pain
hollow viscus gall bladder distended common obstruction cystic duct constant dull aching pain experienced
gall bladder contracts obstruction stretch gall bladder wall suddenly intensified producing crescendo pain addition constant dull ache already present gall bladder colic
individual perceives pain intensity differently
intensity pain individual patient often assessed way patient physically responds
patients peritonitis somatic pain invariably lie still perhaps one side knees hips flexed whereas patients pain arising hollow solid viscera visceral pain lie still constantly change position move
take example patient sudden onset chemical peritonitis secondary perforated duodenal ulcer
patient immediately stop whatever activity moment perforation quickly sit lie remain still possible
contrast patient onset abdominal pain caused acute distention gall bladder able find comfort lying position move chair bed bathroom numerous attempts relieve pain enemas cathartics self induced vomiting antacids home remedies gas pains characteristic responses visceral pain
visceral pain resulting stretch smooth muscle localized one three midline zones abdomen epigastric midabdominal lower abdominal
midline zone pain sum pain right left splachnic pathways poorly localized covers several body segments depending cause varies dull aching constant pain cramping pain
nausea vomiting pallor sweating commonly associated visceral pain
somatic pain well localized
located asymmetrically intensified jarring deep inspiration pressure abdominal wall
one useful physical examination procedures identify presence abdominal pain somatic origin ask patient distend abdomen alternately pushing umbilicus touch examiner hand held inches abdomen suck umbilicus touch spine
subjective parietal peritoneum stretching procedures often identify site somatic pain simple observation
especially useful examination children subjective location pain without actual palpation abdomen physician may obviate misinterpretation child anxiety
since cerebrospinal nerves supply sensation anterior lateral peritoneal surfaces unilateral stimulation parietal peritoneal surfaces lateralized quite well
nausea vomiting pallor sweating seldom associated somatic pain
well patient indicate site pain standing prone position certain true location
three cerebrospinal nerves phrenic obturator genitofemoral particular importance characteristic referred pain carried pathways certain intra abdominal conditions
irritation stretch injury dorsal ventral aspects dome diaphragm produces referred pain supraclavicular fossa kehr sign corresponding sensory branches phrenic nerve c c
irritation genitofemoral nerve retroperitoneal inflammatory processes retrocecal appendicitis retroperitoneal perforation duodenum produces pain labia testicle shaft penis involved side
irritation obturator nerve obturator fossa usually incarcerated obturator hernia produces pain along medial aspect thigh knee howship romberg sign
clearly symptoms accompany abdominal pain important making accurate diagnosis
among important nausea vomiting abdominal distention diarrhea constipation obstipation tarry stools chills fever urinary frequency hematuria jaundice
splanchnic cerebrospinal two neural pathways available transmission abdominal pain
pacinian corpuscles free nerve endings walls viscera splanchnic afferent nerve receptors
sensitive stretch spasm
contrast receptors cerebrospinal nerves sensitive pressure friction cutting burning stimulus appreciated skin
dorsal root ganglia splanchnic cerebrospinal cell bodies side side
proximal fibers also terminate close proximity within spinal cord
close relationship anatomic pathways may account fact severe visceral pain rapid distention viscus may spill somatic segments viscerosensory visceromotor reflexes absence somatic nerve irritation
understanding spillover pain essential accurate diagnosis abdominal pain
since embryonic gut appendages arise midline organs splanchnic innervation bilateral accordingly visceral pain perceived midline
cerebrospinal nerves parietal peritoneum segmental arrangement lower thoracic dermatomes
nerve fibers visceral peritoneum
substitute careful history type onset location progression abdominal pain symptoms closely match pathogenesis disease process within abdomen
coupled understanding splanchnic cerebrospinal innervation abdominal viscera essential arriving accurate diagnosis patients presenting abdominal pain
differences location rate progression lesions within abdominal cavity may summarized outlined smith terms five possible components
visceral pain alone symmetric pain located midline anteriorly without associated vasomotor phenomena
occasion visceral pain rapid onset great severity peak intensity pain may spill spinal cord level viscerosensory visceromotor reflexes corresponding cerebrospinal pathways producing somatic findings without pathologic involvement somatic receptors
visceral somatic pain often become combined causative lesion progresses viscus involve adjacent somatic nerves
visceral pain may continue new different pain added
somatic pain may severe overshadows visceral pain origin affected viscus making accurate diagnosis difficult
referred pain due irritation phrenic obturator genitofemoral nerves unique diagnostically important findings remote abdomen may provide clues source abdominal pain
clinical significance pathways stimuli responsible production abdominal pain perhaps best appreciated analysis pathogenesis acute appendicitis disease process correlates symptoms physical findings common disorder
initiating event starts pathogenesis common type appendicitis obstruction lumen appendix calcified concretion fecal material called fecolith
obstruction appendiceal lumen continued production large amounts mucus rich concentration goblet cells crypts lieberkuhn distends appendix
stage pathogenesis appendicitis pathologic diagnosis acute appendiceal mucocoele
since stretch distention stimuli appreciated splanchnic visceral nerves characteristic midline upper abdominal visceral pain distention hollow viscus embryologic origin midline classic periumbilical pain early appendicitis begins
although appendix may located almost anywhere abdominal pelvic cavity due variable length well rotation midgut important recognize epigastric periumbilical visceral pain produced distention always midline upper abdominal location
since peristalsis appendix absent best ineffective demonstrated presence fecolith otherwise would extruded lumen visceral pain distention appendix characteristically steady dull aching pain without intermittent waves intensity
great value diagnosis abdominal pain attempt establish pathologic anatomic diagnosis
example pathologic diagnosis acute appendicitis nearly meaningful pathologic anatomic diagnosis acute suppurative right iliac fossa appendicitis
understanding pain pathways types stimuli responsible initiating pain responses abdomen make precise pathologic anatomic diagnoses possible
upper abdominal visceral pain early appendicitis continues increase gradually intensity steady mucous production causes distention obstructed appendiceal lumen
intraluminal pressure progresses veins submucosa appendix become occluded entrapment mucous membrane rigid unyielding lamina propria appendiceal wall
stage pathogenesis edema wall secondary venous outflow occlusion rapidly ensues
swelling addition collection edema fluid causes rather rapid sharp increase stretch appendiceal wall
results marked increase intensity visceral pain
point progression disease often prompts patient seek medical aid
pathologic stage time maximal swelling wall changes acute mucocoele called acute catarrhal appendicitis
since inflammatory process appendix time easily understood elevation white blood cell count increase body temperature
pressures within lumen wall appendix continue increase interference arteriolar blood flow submucosa ensues
stage cells wall appendix along mucosal lining lumen begin die
stage set invasion wall appendix organisms lumen onset acute suppurative appendicitis begins
obviously wall appendix stretch sensitive pacinian corpuscles dies dull aching intense upper midabdominal pain transmitted nerve endings disappears
pain patterns appendicitis depend anatomic location
said characteristic symptomatology acute appendicitis
symptoms appendicitis characteristic stage progression pathologic process anatomic sites appendix may located
prodrome produced early pathologic changes appendix characterized visceral pain distention matter appendix located symptoms suppuration continuing pathologic progression leading gangrene rupture abscess formation local generalized peritonitis differ markedly depending anatomic location appendix
appendix part midgut rotates outside abdominal cavity embryologic development may located least nine locations right iliac fossa retrocecal paraileal retroileal interloop pelvic right upper quadrant left upper quadrant left iliac fossa
common location appendix right iliac fossa
location inflammatory process suppurating appendix involves contiguous parietal peritoneum
new pain entirely different visceral pain early stages mediated entirely different neural pathway begins
sharp well localized somatic pain irritation parietal peritoneum transmitted dorsal root via intercostal nerves
patient points one finger location pain jarring stretch deep breath production direct indirect rebound tenderness increases local intensity pain
additional pathognomonic features acute appendicitis right iliac fossa include straightforward motor sensory reflex arcs produce involuntary guarding involved irritated dermatome well hyperesthesia similarly distributed
although often stated periumbilical pain appendicitis shifts right lower quadrant instructive emphasize right lower quadrant pain new entirely different pain
initiated irritation somatic nerve endings transmitted different neural pathways produces sharply localized symptoms findings marked contrast diffuse nature visceral pain
examination symptoms findings acute suppurative appendicitis retrocecal location another common position serves emphasize importance understanding anatomy innervation peritoneal cavity retroperitoneum pelvis well
stated visceral peritoneum somatic innervation
appendix located retrocecally example essential remember location retroperitoneal accordingly contiguity either visceral parietal peritoneal serosa
early abdominal pain produced stretch present characteristic upper abdominal location suppuration begins inflammatory involvement parietal peritoneal surfaces iliac fossa appendicitis consequently localized right lower quadrant pain
reason absence somatic pain appendix retrocecal obvious
inflammatory process retrocecal appendicitis continues may involve psoas muscle obturator muscles ureter genitofemoral nerve
irritation structures responsible producing positive psoas obturator sign white blood cells urine referred pain distribution branches genitofemoral nerve
latter manifested pain testicle shaft penis labia right
appendix located pelvis must remembered pelvis part abdominal cavity pelvic parietal peritoneum receives somatic innervation lumbosacral rather intercostal nerves
accordingly irritation pelvic parietal peritoneum recognized patient localized abdominal wall distribution
helpful recall irritation pelvic parietal peritoneum usually produces localized pain midline suprapubicly regardless location inflammatory process
preceding detailed discussion characteristic pain patterns seen appendicitis pathology responsible serves illustrate diagnostic importance accurate interpretation abdominal pain based anatomy pathology
upper abdominal organs anatomic features make pain patterns emanating far complex appendix
painful lesions gastroesophageal junction fundus lesser curvature stomach biliary tract proximal portions duodenum commonly produce pain interscapular zone corresponding sixth thoracic segment since somatic innervation lesser omentum supplied thoracic nerve
pancreatic pain often perceived location one segment lower
stomach situated portions surface contact diaphragm gastrohepatic ligament lesser sac pancreas parietal peritoneum splenic hilus gastrocolic ligament transverse mesocolon transverse colon
inflammatory neoplastic lesions stomach involve surfaces may irritate somatic nerves several different spinal segments
accordingly pain may localized patient supraclavicular fossa phrenic nerve stimuli interscapular region irritation even lumbar region involvement l spinal cord segments
similarly stomach duodenum anatomic relationship number somatic cerebrospinal nerve roots
result perforating ulcer pain appreciated interscapular zone right subcostal region right lower quadrant depending somatic nerves involved pathologic process
retroperitoneal perforation duodenum blunt abdominal trauma may cause irritation genitofemoral nerve leaking duodenal contents resulting pain right testicle labia
pain gall bladder biliary tract may bilateral localization arise outbudding midline gut bilateral splanchnic innervation
inflammatory process acute suppurative cholecystitis involves parietal peritoneum right upper quadrant somatic pain usual local manifestations referred pain along involved cerebrospinal nerve tip scapula may present
involvement parietal peritoneum right upper quadrant suppuration gall bladder common event greater omentum somatic sensory innervation often surrounds inflamed gall bladder buffer inflammatory process parietes
pathologic conditions arise pancreas responsible broad spectrum pain producing syndromes
addition extrinsic lesions e g penetrating duodenal ulcer frequently involved production pain pancreas
disruption integrity gland pancreatitis permits extravasation enzymes spread many different intra abdominal locations may involve somatic spinal pathways phrenic nerve lumbosacral plexus
small intestine like rest midgut produces upper midline periumbilical visceral pain response distention stretch
foregut hindgut far less sensitive stretch distention
pain portions intestinal tract stomach duodenum former descending colon rectum latter often initiated inflammatory lesions distention
experimental studies production pain gastrointestinal tract humans inflation balloons various locations within lumen gut interpreted cautiously bear little resemblance actual pathologic conditions produce pain humans
valid observations concerning origins abdominal pain come surgeons advantage prompt inspection site pathology within abdomen opportunity compare findings spot patient perception abdominal pain
skin subcutaneous tissues fascia muscle parietal peritoneum abdominal wall richly supplied somatic nerves
pain abdominal wall result neuromas scars previous laparotomies medical conditions acute porphyria herpes zoster
addition pain trauma abdominal wall blunt injury must carefully identified rule abdominal pain originating intraperitoneal injury
ureters second pancreas source abdominal pain caused structures retroperitoneum
renal pelvis sensitive distention ureters richly supplied nerves
ureteral pain ipsilateral severe cramping nature renal colic
usually severity located flank diagnosis difficult confuse abdominal catastrophies
pain testicle labia may occasion confuse diagnosis renal colic retrocecal appendicitis
presence red blood cells urinalysis may help solve diagnostic dilemma
since lower intercostal nerves also provide parietal pleura periphery diaphragm sensory somatic innervation well abdominal wall anterior peritoneal parietes understandable inflammatory processes involve parietal pleura innervated nerves may also manifested abdominal pain
needless say appendectomy poor therapy right lower lobar pneumonia produced reflex abdominal wall pain right lower quadrant
pericarditis myocardial infarction pulmonary infarction may also cause inflammatory lesions involve parietal diaphragmatic thoracic pleura producing referred abdominal pain may misdiagnosed primary intraperitoneal disorder
