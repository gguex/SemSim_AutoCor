heart sounds discrete bursts auditory vibrations varying intensity loudness frequency pitch quality duration
first heart sound composed several high frequency components first two normally audible
two sets audible vibrations temporally related closure mitral tricuspid valves
first heart sound coincides contraction ventricles thus identifying onset ventricular systole end mechanical diastole
examination conducted warm quiet room
place patient supine position clothing removed chest

warm hands stethoscope warn patient hands may cool first
comfortable satisfactory position examiners patient right side
since heart sounds may palpable attempt palpate first sound heel right hand andor fingerpads initially cardiac apex entire precordium
acoustic events analyzed assessed venous arterial chest wall pulsations
auscultatory examination commonly begun aortic area second right intercostal space stethoscope inched pulmonary area second left intercostal space tricuspid area lower left sternal border mitral area cardiac apex shown figure
follow identical routine every examination passing one part another particular order
force habit listening one sound time using great care time heart sounds exactly
listen stethoscope diaphragm pressed firmly chest best hear high frequency vibrations first heart sound
concentrate several cycles quality intensity first heart sound dismissing everything else mind sound clearly identified appraised
first sound normally lower pitch second sound
quality first heart sound time relationship second heart sound make possible experienced observer recognize definite rhythm thus easily distinguish
normal slow heart rates first paired heart sounds following longer diastolic period preceding shorter systolic period
sounds separated simultaneously feeling looking apex impulse listening first heart sound synchronous outward thrust apex impulse
experience possible watch movement stethoscope chest listening heart sounds order time systole diastole
apex impulse seen felt pulsation carotid artery used guide
finger carotid artery sense palpable arterial upstroke immediately follows first heart sound
rapid heart rates however slight delay first sound carotid pulsation may make maneuver unsatisfactory
use distant artery purpose leads error time takes pulse wave reach periphery
accurate identification first heart sound multiple sounds audible move stethoscope gradually second right fourth left intercostal space ics inching along left sternal border
ask patient turn left lateral position
examine apical area patient actually turning using light pressure stethoscope bell
auscultatory areas may helpful certain situations include epigastrium first second left ics
auscultation also performed sitting position especially emphysematous patients since heart sounds may distant even absent supine position
changing position patient may accentuate sounds bringing heart closer chest wall accelerating blood flow due exertion

presents graphic form events cardiac cycle
genesis first heart sound controversial
recent use echophonocardiographic intracardiac techniques supports concept originally proposed leatham consists two major elements temporally related mitral tricuspid closure
actual contact valve cusps believed source sound
therefore heart sounds likely represent vibrations cardiac structures blood within heart
vibrations produced cardiac cycle abrupt acceleration deceleration mass blood within ventricles associated sudden tensing entire atrioventricular av valve apparatus e papillary muscles chordae tendineae valve leaflets rings stretches surrounding structures elastic limits
rapid forces louder sounds higher frequency
onset ventricular diastole mitral tricuspid valves open respective leaflets separate widely
opening av valves normally silent
ventricular filling leaflets av valve begin close onset atrial systole partially closed leaflets reopen
atrial systole ends ventricle recoils leaflets close
following closure av valves stretched toward atrium momentum ventricular blood mass
av valves reach greatest excursion blood volume abruptly checked decelerated
events set motion stretch recoil sequence
subsequent vibrations cardiohemic system produce discrete sounds audible range heard chest wall first heart sound composed mitral closure sound tricuspid closure sound
areas chest wall various acoustic events preferentially transmitted include second right ics second third left ics fourth fifth left ics epigastrium cardiac apex
factors responsible transmission include size position heart thorax presence fluid fibrous thickening pericardium position degree aeration lungs
normal heart sounds differ considerably various chest wall locations patient positions
region apex example heart sounds usually loud heart direct contact anterior wall thorax
patients thick chest walls pulmonary emphysema heart sounds may poorly heard inaudible
heard clearly patient bends forward lies left side examined point maximal expiration
young persons thin elastic chests heart sounds heard greater intensity older subjects whose chest walls thicker stiffer
one lungs retracted disease heart sounds area heart covered lung seem intensified
therefore attributing abnormal heart sounds disease heart exclude factors
addition several different patient positions e g supine left lateral sitting occasionally prone used auscultation
cardiac auscultation extremely difficult human auditory system well suited unusual vibratory characteristics heart sounds murmurs
careful training proper use good stethoscope concentration selected portions cardiac cycle help improve auscultation
good stethoscope must ear tips fit snugly bend earpieces aligns properly ear canals double tubes cm length mm
internal diameter trumpet bell diaphragm attenuates low frequency vibrations alter high frequency vibrations
since auscultation significantly influenced background noise examination best carried quiet room
hearing components first heart sound depends ability ear integrate frequency intensity vibrations making sound
ear detect two sounds separated interval little
second
loud sound however may momentarily deafen ear result almost simultaneous faint sound may heard
proper appreciation high pitched components first sound diaphragm stethoscope applied sufficient pressure leave mark ring chest removed
first sound evaluated quality intensity degree splitting
normal first heart sound audible four classic listening areas intensity quality usually differ auscultatory areas
first heart sound booming quality lower pitched duller longer second heart sound
usually louder apex second sound
base however components second sound normally louder first sound see chapter second heart sound
lower left sternal border tricuspid closure sound best heard splitting best evaluated
intensity amplitude loudness first heart sound affected position av valve leaflets end diastole e pq interval electrocardiogram therefore closing velocity force ventricular contractility anatomical condition valves
intensity first sound primarily related position av valves onset ventricular systole
first sound usually louder subjects short pq interval long pq interval
shorter pq interval wider separation av valve cusps ventricular systole begins later valve closure
results rapid valve closing motion increased intensity maximal intensity occurs pq intervals msec
sec
pq interval progressively increases reduction intensity
pq intervals greater msec
sec
first degree heart block less separation av valves already begun close atrial relaxation
therefore ventricular systole begins less excursion av valves occurs earlier
since less force applied av valves closing velocity reduced resulting softer
although increased intensity first sound may expected shortening pq interval apply short pq interval wolff parkinson white syndrome onset ventricular contraction occurs later indicated onset electrocardiographic delta wave
loud first heart sound hallmark hemodynamically significant mitral stenosis
mobile stiff mitral leaflets produce loud unless leaflets heavily calcified
loud due primarily greater excursion leaflets closure since elevated left atrial pressure kept leaflets relatively wide apart
addition stiff noncompliant leaflets chordae tendineae appear resonate increased amplitude
similar mechanism responsible loud patients left atrial myxoma
conditions increase myocardial contractility including hyperadrenergic states e g exercise anxiety anemia fever pregnancy thyrotoxicosis also tend associated loud
prime factor increasing intensity conditions increased rate pressure development ventricles
first sound also tends louder young people patients thin chest walls
decreased intensity occurs conditions cause av valves close prior ventricular systole reduction rate intraventricular pressure development
first degree heart block common cause soft
holosystolic mitral regurgitation ventricular septal defect acute aortic regurgitation also reduce intensity
holosystolic regurgitation ventricular septal defect intensity may decreased masked murmur isovolumic period may absent rate rise intraventricular pressure may blunted
acute severe aortic regurgitation commonly diminished preclosure mitral valve occurs result rapid increase left ventricular filling pressure
decrease intensity also associated myocardial depression e g cardiomyopathy myxedema acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock rate intraventricular pressure development reduced
pulmonary emphysema increased amount lung tissue interposed chest wall heart also tends attenuate
beat beat variations intensity occur conditions vary pq interval e g second degree av block wenckebach type presence av dissociation e g complete heart block junctional ventricular tachycardia variable rates intraventricular pressure development e g atrial fibrillation pulsus alternans
intensity may also vary electrical alternans
splitting first heart sound two audible components normal finding cardiac auscultation
interval normally separated msec
fact first heart sound split may helpful certain disease states
instance loud tricuspid component first heart sound may heard patients ebstein anomaly right atrial myxoma atrial septal defect straight back syndrome
mitral component first heart sound extremely loud may heard throughout precordium patients mitral stenosis
wide splitting first sound almost always abnormal
split may increased msec patients right bundle branch block ebstein anomaly conditions electrical delay activitation one two ventricles e g ventricular ectopic beats ventricular tachycardia av block idioventricular rhythm left ventricular pacing
splitting first sound characteristic left bundle branch block significant delay onset left ventricular contraction
mechanical delays closure mitral valve e g mitral stenosis left atrial myxoma tricuspid valve e g right atrial myxoma may cause abnormal splitting first heart sound
sounds occurring around time must differentiated split first sound include atrial gallop fourth heart sound ejection sound es early systolic click
fourth heart sound forms complex low pitched late diastolic presystolic sound
may emanate either left right ventricle
left sided much common occurrence confined cardiac apex associated palpable presystolic distention apex impulse
best heard bell stethoscope placed lightly apex barely making air seal attenuated increased pressure bell e creation diaphragm
usually reduced intensity standing e reduced venous return
ejection sound forms es complex high pitched early systolic sound
may heard base splitting heard cardiac apex emanates aorta aortic valve
reliable maneuver differentiate two acoustical events
systolic click mitral valve prolapse contrast occurs later systole ejection sound varies location systole certain maneuvers change shape left ventricle
