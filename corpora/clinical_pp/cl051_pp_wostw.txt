although pain common symptom brings patient physician impossible give precise definition since individual suffering pain perceive describe
general pain uncomfortable sensory experience physiochemical affective components
serves warn individual either physical psychological damage
clinician duty discover treat source pain well treat pain
patients sensory perversions sensory system disordered sensations may diminished increased distorted
diminution loss pain sensation termed hypoalgesia analgesia
hyperpathia indicates lowered threshold painful sensation
stimuli usually nonpainful cause pain e g sunburn
nervous system damage characteristic condition
paresthesias spontaneous painful discharges e g burning sensation diabetic neuropathy
causalgias defined combination hyperpathias paresthesias
since pain subjective experience accurate history essential

sseverity
although largely subjective useful know degree patient views pain threatening disabling
accomplished direct questioning patient compare severity pain common type pain sprained ankle minor burn
ttemporal relationships
examiner determine time onset pain development number times pain experienced duration pain
also important note whether pain intermittent associated pain free intervals chronic exacerbations remissions pain
historic information obtained examiner usually sufficient information begin develop differential diagnosis
although features mentioned appear applicable episodes acute pain pain associated trauma angina pectoris equally useful patients chronic pain sensory perversions
although patients acute pain syndromes easily relate factors aggravate relieve discomfort patients chronic pain seldom exact factors
quality discomfort chronic pain ill defined
region pain equally ill defined
usually explained known anatomic physiologic grounds
severity almost always disabling temporal characteristics vague
therefore inability patient relate positive features regarding pain useful defining patient chronic pain syndrome
patients sensory perversions nervous system damage may give history suggestive chronic pain syndrome
although components history may clear acute pain syndromes take increased clarity known physiologic mechanisms invoked
example would painful paresthesias associated diabetes mellitus
although provocative palliative factors ill defined burning tingling quality characteristic
considered known complication diabetes mellitus severity temporal relationships much easily explained
sensation pain subserved complex network peripheral visceral nerves spinal cord brain
sensory neurons either small myelinated fibers delta conduct impulses rapidly msec small unmyelinated fibers c fibers conduct impulses slowly
msec
presence two types fibers explain occurrence double pain initial sharp well localized pain mediated myelinated delta fibers followed poorly localized aching pain mediated slower unmyelinated c fibers
fibers termed polymodal nociceptors since stimulated several factors including temperature mechanical deformation chemical mediators inflammation
polymodal nociceptors show increased activity decreased firing threshold repeated activation unlike sensory receptors fatigue repeated firing
primary afferent nociceptor activated noxious stimulus
message transmitted small diameter axons enter spinal cord via dorsal ventral spinal roots
cells spinal cord activated signal transmitted brainstem thalamus cortex modulating factors occur conscious perception pain takes place
pain transmission subject several modulating factors within nervous system
include synergistic effects products inflammation inhibiting effects large diameter nonnociceptive afferent fibers chemical modulation catecholamines substance p serotonin endorphins
combinations chemical mediators inflammation synergistic effect increasing nociceptor activity peripheral nerves
catecholamines also involved modulation primary afferent nociceptors
although mechanism catecholamines influence pain transmission clear hypothesized may increased numbers alpha adrenergic receptors injured c fibers increased activity results corresponding increase pain sensation
substance p neurotransmitter located polymodal nociceptors
stimulus strong enough activate c fibers also elicits release substance p cerebrospinal fluid
experimental models depletion substance p polymodal nociceptor results analgesia noxious stimuli area subserved treated nerve
associated small diameter nociceptive fibers large diameter nonnociceptive afferent fibers
fibers first postulated head early part century proposed concept peripheral sensation composed two distinct components
termed components epicritic mediate fine discrimination protopathic mediate noxious sensation
conscious sensation results balance two
melzack wall proposed gate control theory pain perception
although gate completely understood large diameter fibers lower threshold stimulation inhibit stimulation c fiber nociceptors activated
significant findings recent years regarding endogenous mediation pain discovery opiate receptors brain endogenous morphine like compounds endorphins
although naturally occurring opioids known centuries potent analgesics relatively recently opioid compounds synthesized
shortly thereafter noted compounds capable antagonizing effects opioids
observation developed theory two classes compounds agonists antagonists compete binding site brain
mid opioid receptors identified followed discovery first two endorphins leucine methionine enkephalin
recent work shown analgesia may caused stimulation certain areas brain peri aqueductal gray area
areas brain also high concentrations endorphins
also theorized least three types opiate receptors mu delta kappa
information may help explain differing potencies side effects opioid analgesics help explain differing perceptions pain
serotonin neurotransmitter involved depression plays role modulation pain
descending pathways terminate spinal cord areas close spinal cord cells responsive painful stimuli
high concentration serotonin terminal axons stimulation cells inhibits pain responsive cells therefore pain transmission
acute pain syndromes tend clear etiologies respond readily appropriate therapy
chronic pain serves less warning function becomes part patient life
chronic pain syndromes divided three categories associated clinically significant structural disease e g rheumatoid arthritis cancer pain associated history structural disease psychological factors predispose physiologic alterations muscle spasm chronic lower back pain anatomic physiologic basis patient complaints exemplified somatoform disorders
time frame development chronic pain exact
patients acute pain syndromes chronic pain related chronic metabolic structural changes terminal cancer understanding pain physiology help physician develop effective pain management techniques
treatment effective transmission pain blocked close stimulus
possible first step treating pain remove pathologic lesion initiating pain
next step eliminate modify chemical mediators involved primary afferent nociceptors
nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids primary tools clinically available
agents work blocking metabolism arachidonic acid
given noxious stimulus block generation impulses nociceptors
stimulus already present effect ongoing activity nociceptor
explains continuous use drugs gives effective pain relief occasional use clearly seen chronic inflammatory conditions rheumatoid arthritis
attempts utilize substances antihistamine agents block specific chemical mediators inflammation effective
another effective approach acute pain management lower concentration chemical mediators
exemplified application cold trauma
inciting lesion removed interference chemical mediators satisfactory local anesthetics may considered temporary measure
act blocking conduction along nociceptor fibers
addition useful pain control local anesthetics also help localize pain
example pain relieved local anesthetic may referred another area
physician takes account pain modulating factors pain control measures become apparent
since catecholamines increase sensation pain chemical surgical sympathectomies useful certain situations sympathetic dystrophy causalgia
efforts made formulate specific substance p antagonists
work promises provide new agents add pain relief armamentarium
gate theory malzack wall offers explanation transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens effective
large diameter non nociceptive fibers stimulated nonpainful impulse interferes transmission painful impulses along primary afferent nociceptors
since non nociceptive fibers lower threshold stimulation tens units selectively activate fibers
units effective self limited acute pain syndromes
pain syndromes forms headache respond use serotoninergic antidepressant amitriptyline
agent increases concentration serotonin synaptic cleft presumably inhibiting function pain signal transmission
effective use narcotic analgesic agents made understanding opiate receptors endorphins
benefits limitations therapy placebos better understood since effectiveness involves endogenous opioid system endorphins
positive placebo response involves stimulation endogenous opioid system
although placebos distinct limitations positive response patients achieve lower expected doses analgesics probably involves endogenous opioid system
research utilizing response pain relief undertaken
patients diagnosis chronic pain syndrome somatization disorder hypochondriacal disorder detectable anatomic physiologic derangements explain discomfort
although treatment plans made using principles outlined physician needs aware patients since constitute significant percentage physician practice
many patients form depression
depression emotional pain complex phenomenon biological psychological social components
emotional maturity required accurately recognize accurately report emotional pain development maturity often blunted patients
since source emotional physical complaints explained known physiologic grounds
patients respond antidepressant pharmacotherapy
others best managed help pain control center
maximum response warm caring relationship developed physician
least patients helped improve functional abilities satisfied life spite pain
