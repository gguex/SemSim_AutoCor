examiner sensitive small deviations symmetry normally seen region region experience necessary distinguish normal abnormal finding
examiner alert signs increased work breathing respiratory distress presence absence certain pathologic constellations particularly consolidation pleural effusion pneumothorax table
respiratory examination normally performed according osler classic sequence inspection palpation percussion auscultation table
lobes lung systematically examined
examiner aware surface projections five lobes figures
findings compared left right upper lower anterior posterior
examination starts thorough inspection
patient seated supine examiner begins facing patient counting patient respiratory rate observing rise fall chest wall abdomen
fifteen seconds observation suffice
noted whether irregularities patient respiratory rhythm present chapter
depth inspiratory efforts noted compared examiner perception normal
relative time taken inspiratory expiratory phases compared
two thirds respiratory cycle normally spent inspiration e
examiner next observe pattern respiratory muscle use
normally diaphragm work inspiration abdomen move outward along chest wall diaphragm descends figure
inward inspiratory motion abdomen termed abdominal paradox suggests diaphragmatic dysfunction figure
inward inspiratory motion chest wall suggestive decrease lung compliance
placing palms hands chest abdomen may help confirm visual impression
active use abdominal musculature expiration distinctly abnormal
look see strap muscles neck scalenes sternocleidomastoids contracting inspiration causing upward motion entire chest
use accessory muscles suggestive increased inspiratory work breathing
extreme increases inspiratory work breathing may reflected accentuated swings pleural pressure
negative pleural pressure may manifested inspiratory retraction suprasternal supraclavicular notches intercostal spaces
presence notch retraction pulsus paradoxus frequently present always measured figure
finally examiner note whether hemithoraces move equally simultaneously note whether anomalies chest wall present
remaining phases examinationpalpation percussion auscultationit efficient complete examination anterior chest ask patient sit upright complete examination posterior chest
anterior chest examination covers muscles respiration trachea major airways anterior upper lobes right middle lobe lingula respectively
posterior chest examination covers posterior segments upper lobes superior segments lower lobes posterior lateral basal segments lower lobes
palpation serves reinforce impressions generated inspection provides preliminary impressions state parenchyma confirmed percussion auscultation
begin establishing whether trachea midline
place thumb index fingers examining hand lateral aspects trachea suprasternal notch palpate relative distances fingers borders sternocleidomastoid muscles
normally trachea midline distances equal
palpate sternomastoid muscles determine whether tensing inspiration reflecting accessory muscle use
next anterior chest palpated palms flat chest wall thumbs touching sternum establish midline figure
hands placed angle louis fourth fifth intercostal space lower costal margin
patient asked take slow deep breaths expansion hemithoraces observed attention paid whether expansion equal amplitude timing
costal margin palpated determine presence end inspiratory retraction hoover sign
hoover sign suggests severe hyperinflation air trapping see figure
finally examiner hands placed mid chest midline upper abdomen determine whether thoraco abdominal dyssynchrony paradoxical movements might present rule active use abdominal muscles expiration
percussion thorax attempts assess state pulmonary parenchyma whether filled normally air consolidated hyperinflated
percussion may also detect obliteration pleural space fluid pleural effusion air pneumothorax
percussion performed normal tidal breathing projection lobes figure
percussion note elicited placing distal ends middle index fingers flat surface percussed

normal percussion note generally heard lung fields
tympanitic hyperresonant note elicited gastric air bubble left hemidiaphragm dull percussion note normally encountered liver
percussion note also dull cardiac borders left anterior chest
otherwise normal note encountered throughout hemithoraces
auscultation assesses state airways provides additional information state lung parenchyma
like findings inspection palpation percussion normal findings characterized symmetry
auscultation performed using diaphragm stethoscope lobar projections inspiration expiration
patient asked breathe slowly deeply mouth
patients may breath hold inspiration need told exhale
simple requests usually suffice cases
spontaneous respiratory rate may estimated auscultation patients whose shallow breathing pattern makes measurement inspection palpation difficult
remember warm stethoscope examining patient
breath sounds described according quality intensity transmission characteristics presence absence extra adventitious sounds
breath sounds qualitatively described normal vesicular bronchial
normal breath sounds compared sounds heard examiner chest provided significant respiratory problems present
bronchial breath sounds louder higher pitched harsher immediate normal vesicular sounds ordinarily heard directly trachea
unlike normal vesicular sounds expiration heard particular clarity bronchial breathing
bronchial sounds anywhere else chest abnormal suggest consolidation lung parenchyma
sounds intermediate quality sometimes referred bronchovesicular
intensity breath sounds relates amount airflow region examined proximity lung examiner
normally sounds heard somewhat louder bases upper lobes reflecting normal apical basal gradient regional ventilation
experience necessary asymmetric intensity encountered distinguish regional increase intensity decrease areas
listening tidal breathing examiner alert presence adventitious lung sounds extra sounds associated respiration
crackles râles discontinuous monophonic sounds heard inspiration reflect opening closed terminal respiratory units
wheezes continuous polyphonic sounds heard expiration reflect narrowing intrathoracic airways
rhonchi low pitched continuous snoring sounds heard either inspiration expiration associated uncleared secretions airways
stridor wheezing sound commonly encountered extrathoracic airways heard inspiration
stridor usually reflects extrathoracic airway obstruction may caused fixed obstruction anywhere tracheobronchial tree
pleural rubs may heard either respiratory phase sound like rubbing leather
transmission spoken sounds influenced underlying parenchyma state pleural space
normal air containing lung pleural spaces relatively poor transmitters sounds
transmission may decreased even presence excess air fluid pleural space increased presence consolidation
transmission described normal increased decreased
transmission tested vocal fremitus tactile fremitus whispered pectriloquy
significance one may tested one patient depending examiner level confidence findings elicited
traditionally vocal fremitus tested listening diaphragm stethoscope projections lobe asking patient repeatedly say ninety nine
patient say boy oil freud also work closely approximates original technique nineteenth century german physicians introduced method
tactile fremitus may evaluated palpating areas chest palms hands asking patient say words
significance fremitus either auscultation palpation
modalities need checked patients cases uncertainty two methods reinforce
whispered pectriloquy elicited patient whisper one two three examiner listens stethoscope diaphragm projections lobes
normally sounds distinctly perceived words may clearly discernible presence consolidation
whispered pectriloquy significance increased fremitus adds new information approaches
egophony e change name derived greek bleating goats special case altered transmission
consolidation pleural effusions allow certain sound frequencies pass examiner ear tend distort sound vowel e perceived examiner aaah
egophony elicited listening projection lobes stethoscope diaphragm asking patient say e
additionally forced expiratory time fet may give clue presence obstructive disease
patient take full deep inspiration hold breath
command patient exhale hard fast possible keep squeezing air gone
forced expiratory maneuver pulmonary function test
patient done test makes instructions easier
listen trachea watching second hand watch
breath sounds cease within seconds
continued airflow beyond time suggests airways long time constants emptying obstructive lung disease
sequence examination repeated posteriorly patient sitting position
