numerous historical clues variety organ systems suggest presence absence autonomic dysfunction bedside evaluation autonomic system confined part careful study cardiovascular system
common prominent clinical feature autonomic dysfunction orthostatic hypotension
severe fall blood pressure assumption upright posture usually accompanied dramatic symptoms syncope near syncope
early course however symptoms associated orthostatic hypotension may vague misleading
instances postural hypotension associated autonomic dysfunction would overlooked unless measurement blood pressure supine standing positions recorded routinely course physical examination
normally assumption upright posture accompanied slight decrease systolic pressure usually mm hg less slight increase diastolic blood pressure usually less mm hg
changes blood pressure may accompanied physiologic increase heart rate beats per minute less
certain circumstances normal blood pressure response standing may include decrease systolic blood pressure mm hg increase diastolic pressure much mm hg
although uniform consensus authors define orthostatic hypotension sustained decrease systolic pressure mm hg decrease diastolic pressure mm hg upon standing
orthostatic hypotension synonymous autonomic dysfunction association symptomatic decrease blood pressure magnitude without accompanying increase heart rate must suggest disordered autonomic response
bedside evaluation autonomic nervous system consists primarily observations cardiovascular reflexes pupillary changes casual sweating patterns
initial evaluation normal autonomic control cardiovascular system postural response blood pressure pulse rate
patient supine least minutes blood pressure pulse rate recorded
blood pressure recorded minute intervals upon standing minutes symptoms occur
patients must observed carefully exercise order prevent hypotension point syncope
assistance available prevent injury patient falling
syncope occur patient must immediately placed head legs elevated position restore cerebral perfusion
changes heart rate recorded continuous rhythm strip conventional electrocardiogram obtained seconds prior seconds standing
normal individuals reflex acceleration heart rate maximal approximately seconds standing slows near supine rate approximately seconds standing
failure heart rate increase development symptomatic orthostatic hypotension indicative autonomic dysfunction
valsalva maneuver commonly used method assessing normal disordered autonomic control blood pressure heart rate
test requires maintenance forced expiration resistance least optimally seconds
physiologic response valsalva maneuver divided four phases
first phase blood pressure increases slightly due increased intrathoracic pressure
forced expiration continued mean arterial pressure pulse pressure decrease
second phase heart rate begins increase
third phase begins release forced expiration consists drop blood pressure due sudden drop intrathoracic pressure heart rate increase sustained may accelerate even
fourth phase associated increased cardiac output overshoot hypertension finally reflex bradycardia
autonomic dysfunction blood pressure declines progressively long forced expiration maintained heart rate increase
fourth phase blood pressure overshoot gradual recovery pre valsalva blood pressure reflex bradycardia occurs
changes blood pressure pulse rate valsalva maneuver occur matter seconds accurately recorded intraarterial recording device
repeating maneuver several times minute rest intervals however usually possible document occurrence phase blood pressure overshoot conventional sphygmomanometer
similarly continuous electrocardiogram rhythm strip several valsalva maneuvers interrupted rest intervals permits observable measurable changes heart rate could appreciated radial palpation apical auscultation
equally reliable results obtainable patient sitting supine position
subtle important indication autonomic dysfunction absence respiration associated sinus arrhythmia
continuous conventional electrocardiogram rhythm strip recorded patient instructed breathe slowly deeply rate breaths per minute
heart rate normally increases inspiration decreases expiration respiratory rate per minute difference fastest slowest heart rate usually beats per minute
differences beats per minute less observed autonomic dysfunction
additional tests cardiovascular response performed bedside evaluate autonomic integrity
induction mental stress form mental arithmetic problem frequently produces small less mm hg rise systolic blood pressure
similarly immersion extremity foot hand ice water minutes results increase systolic blood pressure non immersed limb
problem tests normal individuals may respond increased systolic pressure absence response necessarily imply autonomic dysfunction
lastly integrity autonomic system assessed means hand dynamometer device measures force hand grip
test requires patient maintain maximal hand grip strength minutes
maneuver produces rise systolic blood pressure normal individuals
variety pupillary abnormalities observed syndromes autonomic dysfunction
may transient permanent may therefore discovered repeated observation
adie pupil larger normal responds poorly light slowly incompletely convergence
pupillary abnormality results interruption parasympathetic intervation eye
horner syndrome consisting constricted pupil miosis droop lid ptosis lack diminished sweating anhidrosis occasionally observed autonomic dysfunction phenomenon alternating anisocoria
instillation various pharmacologic agents conjunctiva may help determine locus autonomic abnormality patient miotic pupils abnormal pupillary responses light
normal pupil dilate installation solution hydroxyamphetamine solution cocaine
neither agent dilate miotic pupil locus autonomic dysfunction postganglionic
pupil responds hydroxyamphetamine stimulates release norepinephrine cocaine inhibits norepinephrine reuptake defect autonomic intervation pupil preganglionic central
possible test systematically disordered sweating bedside casual observation sweating patterns course examination may suggest autonomic abnormalities
patients observed total absence sweating extremely warm environment absence sweating isolated areas restriction profuse sweating upper body sweating lower body areas absent
casual observation patient suspected autonomic dysfunction occasionally reveals phenomenon gustatory sweating profuse sweating associated ingestion food
sweating abnormalities commonly associated autonomic neuropathy diabetes mellitus
postural hypotension autonomic dysfunction represents failure autoregulation peripheral vascular resistance normally occurs upon standing
problem compounded sympathetic denervation heart prevents compensatory increase heart rate
interplay perfusion pressure heart rate demonstrated physiology valsalva maneuver normal individuals
declining mean arterial blood pressure forced expiration accompanied appropriate tachycardia phases maneuver
spite diminishing venous return blood pressure levels due intense peripheral vasoconstriction consequence sympathetic outflow
overshoot blood pressure observed recovery stage consequence increased cardiac output associated increased venous return pumped still vasoconstricted vascular bed
overshoot hypertension results reflex bradycardia return normal blood pressure normal cardiac output reduced peripheral vascular resistance
compensatory vascular reflexes required normal adaptation restricted venous return associated standing require integrity afferent central efferent components autonomic reflex arc may disrupted one loci syndromes autonomic dysfunction
characterization nature lesion responsible autonomic dysfunction frequently helpful narrowing focus etiologic possibilities
diseases resulting autonomic dysfunction commonly categorized preganglionic presynaptic postganglionic postsynaptic
examples former include central forms autonomic dysfunction associated movement disorders shy drager parkinsonian symptoms
syndromes postganglionic neurons intact preganglionic neurons interomediolateral cells columns spinal cord undergo degeneration
common example postganglionic autonomic dysfunction autonomic neuropathy associated diabetes mellitus results degeneration peripheral autonomic fibers
characteristically vasculature syndromes autonomic dysfunction associated peripheral denervation hyperresponsive infused alpha receptor stimulants
feature sometimes helpful distinguishing preganglionic postganglionic causes autonomic dysfunction
tests fraught potentially serious complications performed experienced individuals carefully monitored circumstances
