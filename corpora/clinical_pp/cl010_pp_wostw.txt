dyspnea refers sensation difficult uncomfortable breathing
subjective experience perceived reported affected patient
dyspnea exertion doe may occur normally considered indicative disease occurs level activity usually well tolerated
dyspnea differentiated tachypnea hyperventilation hyperpnea refer respiratory variations regardless patients subjective sensations
tachypnea increase respiratory rate normal hyperventilation increased minute ventilation relative metabolic need hyperpnea disproportionate rise minute ventilation relative increase metabolic level
conditions may always associated dyspnea
orthopnea sensation breathlessness recumbent position relieved sitting standing
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea pnd sensation shortness breath awakens patient often hours sleep usually relieved upright position
two uncommon types breathlessness trepopnea platypnea
trepopnea dyspnea occurs one lateral decubitus position opposed
platypnea refers breathlessness occurs upright position relieved recumbency
patient dyspnea may say feel short breath im difficulty breathing cant catch breath feel like im suffocating
subjective phenomenon perception dyspnea interpretation vary patient patient
begin nonleading question difficulty breathing
response affirmative dyspnea established problem characterized detail
begin
onset sudden insidious
inquire frequency duration attacks
conditions dyspnea occurs ascertained
response activity emotional state change body position noted
ask associated symptoms chest pain palpitations wheezing coughing
sometimes nonproductive cough may present dyspnea equivalent
significant medical problems patient medications taking
much smoked
dyspnea exertion means always indicative disease
normal persons may feel dyspneic strenuous exercise
level activity tolerated individual depends variables age sex body weight physical conditioning attitude emotional motivation
dyspnea exertion would abnormal occurred activity normally well tolerated patient
helpful ask noticed recent progressive limitation ability conduct specific tasks able perform without difficulty past e g walking climbing stairs performing household chores
degree functional impairment assessed manner
additional questions aimed ascertaining whether patient orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
inquire number pillows uses head night whether ever sleep sitting
develop coughing wheezing recumbent position
ever wake night shortness breath
long lying episode occur relieve distress
characteristically patient left ventricular failure sits bedside dangles feet refrains ambulation activity likely worsen symptoms
spontaneous respiration controlled neural chemical mechanisms
rest average kg person breathes times minute tidal volume ml
normal individual aware respiratory effort ventilation doubled dyspnea experienced ventilation tripled
abnormally increased muscular effort needed process inspiration expiration
dyspnea subjective experience always correlate degree physiologic alteration
patients may complain severe breathlessness relatively minor physiologic change others may deny breathlessness even marked cardio pulmonary deterioration
universal theory explains mechanism dyspnea clinical situations
campbell howell formulated length tension inappropriateness theory states basic defect dyspnea mismatch pressure tension generated respiratory muscles tidal volume change length results
whenever disparity occurs muscle spindles intercostal muscles transmit signals bring act breathing conscious level
additionally juxtacapillary receptors j receptors located alveolar interstitium supplied unmyelinated fibers vagus nerve stimulated pulmonary congestion
activates hering breuer reflex whereby inspiratory effort terminated full inspiration achieved resulting rapid shallow breathing
j receptors may responsible dyspnea situations pulmonary congestion occurs pulmonary edema
theories proposed explain dyspnea include acid base imbalance central nervous system mechanisms decreased breathing reserve increased work breathing increased transpulmonary pressure fatigue respiratory muscles increased oxygen cost breathing dyssynergy intercostal muscles diaphragm abnormal respiratory drive
orthopnea caused pulmonary congestion recumbency
horizontal position redistribution blood volume lower extremities splanchnic beds lungs
normal individuals little effect patients additional volume pumped left ventricle disease significant reduction vital capacity pulmonary compliance resultant shortness breath
additionally patients congestive heart failure pulmonary circulation may already overloaded may reabsorption edema fluid previously dependent parts body
pulmonary congestion decreases patient assumes erect position accompanied improvement symptoms
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea may caused mechanisms similar orthopnea
failing left ventricle suddenly unable match output normally functioning right ventricle results pulmonary congestion
additional mechanisms may responsible patients experience paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea sleep
theories include decreased responsiveness respiratory center brain decreased adrenergic activity myocardium sleep
dyspnea exertion caused failure left ventricular output rise exercise resultant increase pulmonary venous pressure
cardiac asthma bronchospasm associated pulmonary congestion probably precipitated action edema fluid bronchial walls local receptors
trepopnea may occur asymmetric lung disease patient lies affected lung gravitational redistribution blood flow
also reported heart disease probably caused distortion great vessels one lateral decubitus position versus
platypnea originally described chronic obstructive pulmonary disease attributed increased wasted ventilation ratio upright position
platypnea association orthodeoxia arterial deoxygenation upright position reported several forms cyanotic congenital heart disease
proposed precipitated slight decrease systemic blood pressure upright position resulting increased right left shunting
dyspnea may induced four distinct settings increased ventilatory demand exertion febrile illness hypoxic state severe anemia metabolic acidosis decreased ventilatory capacity pleural effusion pneumothorax intrathoracic mass rib injury muscle weakness increased airway resistance asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease decreased pulmonary compliance interstitial fibrosis pulmonary edema
early left ventricular failure cardiac output increase sufficiently response moderate exercise tissue cerebral acidosis occurs patient experiences dyspnea exertion
shortness breath may accompanied fatigue sensation smothering sternal compression
later stages left ventricular failure pulmonary circulation remains congested dyspnea occurs mild exertion
moreover patient may develop orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
acute pulmonary edema dramatic manifestation pulmonary venous overload may occur setting recent myocardial infarction last stage chronic left ventricular failure
cardiovascular causes dyspnea include valvular diseases particularly mitral stenosis aortic insufficiency paroxysmal arrhythmia atrial fibrillation pericardial effusion tamponade systemic pulmonary hypertension cardiomyopathy myocarditis
unrestricted fluid intake administration patient oliguric renal failure also likely precipitate pulmonary congestion dyspnea
pulmonary disease constitutes another major category conditions producing dyspnea discussed chapter
important pulmonary causes include bronchial asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary embolism pneumonia pleural effusion pneumothorax allergic pneumonitis interstitial fibrosis
addition dyspnea may occur febrile hypoxic states association psychiatric conditions anxiety panic disorder
diabetic ketoacidosis seldom causes dypsnea commonly induces slow deep respirations termed kussmaul breathing
cerebral lesions intracranial hemorrhage may associated intense hyperventilation sometimes irregularly periodic breathing called biot respiration
cerebral hypoperfusion cause may also result alternating periods hyperventilation apnea called cheyne stokes respiration although breathing difficulty may perceived patient
diagnosis cause dyspnea made relatively easily presence clinical signs heart lung disease
difficulty sometimes encountered determining precipitating cause breathlessness patient cardiac pulmonary conditions
additional diagnostic problem may presence anxiety emotional disorder
careful history physical examination always helpful occasionally cardiac catheterization pulmonary function studies tests may necessary
