clinicians rate patient medical history greater diagnostic value either physical examination results laboratory investigations rich
clinical adage two thirds diagnoses made basis history alone retained validity despite technological advances modern hospital
accurate history also provides focus physical examination making productive time efficient
clinical hypotheses generated interview provide basis cost effective utilization clinical laboratory diagnostic modalities
diagnostic utility interview complemented therapeutic power
medium positive relationship established doctor patient empathic patient centered interview bolster patient sense self esteem lessen feelings helplessness often accompany episode illness
therapeutic alliance forged clinical encounter provides foundation ongoing patient care education
student may wonder medical interview differs conversations special skills required
sense direction distinguishes medical interview casual conversations social encounters
fundamentally medical interview purposeful conversation undertaken set goals priorities clearly maintained physician mind
direction reflects respective needs participantspatient physician
patient enters interview seeking relief discomforts uncertainties illness physician actively conducts interview order clarify patient problems derive diagnostic therapeutic plans patient benefit
interview patient need story heard suffering understood balanced physician need know understand much possible patient problems engel
physicians difficult aspect interviewing patients maintaining balance patient physician agenda actively directing encounter facilitating patient spontaneous report history
best interview becomes dialogue two people driven toward common goal
medical interviews two basic types problem oriented health promotion interviews levinson
goals problem oriented interview reflect patient request help specific problems
health promotion interview establishes data baseline concerning patient current past health problems assesses current health risk factors e g smoking diet alcohol consumption heritable diseases family detect early evidence disease e g change bowel habits weight loss chest discomfort patient consider severe enough warrant problem specific visit doctor
reality medical encounters combine problem oriented health promotion approaches
issues health promotion important patients patients come doctor routine check may hidden concerns specific symptoms
fact careful questioning patient schedules routine check often uncovers significant health concerns
medical interview provides two categories information unavailable source patient says illness said
patient tells physician provides factual content medical history
factual content physician edits records written recordthe medical history
include comprehensive chronological report patient illness enough information positive negative accurate inclusive diagnostic reasoning regarding possible etiologies patient problems
process interview actually happens physician patient encounter
observation process verbal nonverbal provides important information patient person
patient behavior interview e g facial expressions posture gestures communicates emotional concerns reactions illness style relating others
sudden shifts topic avoidance certain issues flow spontaneous associations may point concerns expressed directly
physician communication style behavior interview also critical element interviewing process
distinction content process highlights dual skills required medical interviewanalytical interpersonal
although skills discussed separately must practiced together
clarity validity information gathered interview content may critically determined quality relationship develops patient physician process
candid disclosure patient concerns likely come context nonjudgmental interviewing style
final comment process content may helpful beginning student
content organization written medical history often confused process clinician actually collects information interview
written medical history actually journalistic endeavor clinician edits organizes patient spontaneous report formal organized presentation
final product medical chart may bear little resemblance work clinician performs bedside
patients rarely report symptoms organized logical fashion comparable descriptions disease medical texts
fact patients complain illness sickness rather stating problems terms pathophysiologic categories disease
students expect patient present classic symptom complexes organized fashion experience considerable frustration may become rapidly disillusioned clinical medicine
complaint patient poor historian may reflect unrealistic expectations interviewer part
clinical practice interview collaborative effort physician patient
reiser states physician matter skilled simply extract history patient
patient matter articulate give history final form without help guidance physician
say take history patient implies story illness extracted patient like shaking coin piggy bank
erroneous conception medical interview leads frustrated attempts shaking history patient willfully keeping valuable coin hidden
helping relationship cornerstone medical care rogers
practice medicine medical interview provides perhaps important avenue establishing helping relationship built trust commitment
occur magically
physician actively employs interviewing techniques promote relationship
nonjudgmental interest patient problems active listening empathy communicating patient accurate assessment emotional state concern patient unique person among important tools physician interpersonal repertoire
techniques strengthen therapeutic bond improve interview diagnostic power providing patient attentive receptive audience
many visits physician excluding catastrophic illness motivated request interpretation symptoms patient finds confusing barsky
helping patient describe sort experiences physician provide explanations meaning events feelings formerly perplexing threatening
patient sense control established realistic fashion feelings helplessness hopelessness addressed context helping relationship
problems reframed prioritized help patient develop solutions
obviously goals medical interview much common psychotherapy
furthermore patients sense story taken seriously may feel encouraged become active participants medical care
patient compliance cooperation future diagnostic therapeutic plans often hinge physician skill developing negotiating management plan encourages patient involvement initiative
method physician uses establish rapport differs interview
encounter unique
one patient may respond best reassuring touch one well timed interpretation emotional concerns another moment shared silence
observation patient responses serve physician guide techniques employ provides feedback change course
patients demonstrate remarkable variety responses medical interview reflecting range human personality types responses illness
anger anxiety denial vagueness detail emotional embellishment unreasonable expectations demands difficult common challenges medical interview
first minutes interview physician actively sets stage effective interaction
since interview begins meeting strangersthe physician patientclear introductions important
communicate physician respect patient unique individual
feelings anxiety common initial moments encounter may particularly intense beginning student uncertain role
simple statement usually good way start
hello mrs
parish name john simmons
second year medical student school
interviewing minutes learn kinds problems affected
k
introduction establishes names roles purpose including interest patient response illness time limits interview
course important knock entering patient room begin interview
unfortunately courtesy often neglected hospital rounds
assessing patient comfort next step
iv oxygen mask facial expressions distress emesis basin bedside provide nonverbal clues alert clinician
bringing cup water raising head bed helping patient bathroom may greatly appreciated
also provide natural opportunity caring touch
questions feeling
comfortable
feel well enough talk helpful
best conduct interview quiet private environment
may impossible busy hospital
however televisions turned doors closed curtains pulled
bedrail lowered remove physical barrier communication
patient feels well enough may best help chair
difference interviewing patient lying flat bed one sitting chair striking
simple act emphasize patient autonomy active involvement interview
family members visitors patient room physician introduce present explain purpose interview
allowed stay interviewer inform family patient must given opportunity speak without excessive interruptions editorial comments
family comply problem must addressed directly
first minutes give observant physician valuable information patient communication style behavior well providing tentative list problems
patients need considerable prompting discuss current problems others need limits set rambling history
patient vocabulary clarity expression assessed early encounter
emotional reactions anxiety defensiveness hostility often evident
elements important determining patient reliability historian
first minutes give interviewed time calibrate hisher techniques individual patient engel
recognizing patient emotions responding supportive manner clinician conduct effective patient centered interview
examples interviewer expect confused patient give confused history emotionally reactive patient embellish exaggerate symptoms reactions depressed patient withdrawn require considerable support
introductions completed patient comfort assessed physician must decide initiate questioning
physicians like ask patient social personal background including residence employment family
although technique works well patients others find distracting
seem expect direct inquiry health current problems
frequently used opening questions include problems brought hospital office today
kind problems recently
kind problems would like share
open ended nondirective questions encourage patient report problems
point interview important let patient talk spontaneously rather restricting directing flow information multiple questions
let patient talk freely first minutes initiating detailed inquiry
beckman observations internal medicine residents appears physicians frequently interrupt patients first seconds interview
patients prevented expressing major concerns
unexpressed concerns may become part hidden agenda patient hiding physician hasnt given patient chance talk
patient patient says first may even important complaint
premature selection direction detailed questioning example report generalized fatigue confuse distract patient reporting perhaps significant problems example chest pains fear heart problems
beginning directive closed questions early interview communicates patient remain silent asked specific question
patient may feel good reason major complaint ignored
physician turn may feel frustrated direct questions lead dead ends
physician task arduous heshe must think new question patient response
situations describing patient poor historian obscures fact major problem stems physician premature selection line inquiry full scope patient concerns defined physician overuse closed question answer interactional technique
obtain accurate unbiased information exert much control interview needed
physician task keep patient talking illness productive fashion
facilitation techniques employed encourage guide patient spontaneous report
include use posture gesture words indicate interviewer interested patient saying
techniques reassure patient go speaking provide time patient think respond
shared silence often helps flow interview interviewer maintains eye contact interested manner
necessary come question moment patient falls silent
silences often help patient reexperience emotions provide time needed reflection
interviewers judge patient actively thinking silence needs help getting started
prompt patient continue spontaneous report repeating patient last phrase questioning tone
felt short breath
make observational statement stopped talking moments ago telling weight loss
tell thinking
occasional nods head following patient response yes
huh huh
questioning tone may keep patient talking
selecting focus questioning ask anything else
problems
list extensive obviously beyond time limit available interview ask problems concerns bothers
problems hope could help today
physician ranks problems order importance listens patterns suggest disease processes
problems clearly related chief complaint
others unrelated possible relevance
may become evident patient troubled problems physician considers lower priority less urgent
example patient may concerned finances physician wants learn chest pain palpitations
general clinician briefly communicate concern patient major concerns even seem medically significant
example
mentioned quite problems may time clarify
see worried finances
concerns need attention
work
would like find chest pain fainting spell mentioned
physician assume patient concerns raised early interview
patients may talk embarrassing confidential problems rapport trust deepened
infrequently patient brings important issues end encounter stating oh way doctor
clinician explores fully possible patient major problems following leads obtained discussion chief complaint
history present illness hpi includes patient history recent remote pertinent understanding current illness
completing hpi physician often collect pertinent information patient past history example history hypertension patient stroke patient family history example family history breast cancer patient breast lump social history example domestic discord patient insomnia fatigue
new piece information assessed reliability completeness relevance patient problem
physician repeatedly scan information already gathered looking symptom complexes diagnostic patterns
example physician interviewing year old woman fever back pain urinary frequency would immediately consider possibility urinary tract infection
increasing knowledge clinical syndromes clinician ability form complex diagnostic hypotheses improves
hypothesis tested validity specific questions ever bladder kidney infection
kidney stones
sexually active
process speculations tested objective reality accurate hypotheses generated
begin line inquiry open ended question proceed specific questions fill gaps
encourage patient provide primary data words symptoms rather provide diagnostic labels hearsay doctors family members secondary tertiary information
patient may need coaching information physician seeks
example patient complains esophagitis asked describe symptoms physician accepts diagnostic label
questions worded patient difficulty understanding asked
avoid using technical terms diagnostic labels
interviewer questions indicate type information requested answer expected
difference asking stomach problems
youre hurting stomach
obvious easy fall pattern asking leading questions
effective questions usually simple
avoid double barreled questions stomach pains bladder problems
engel describes seven dimensions characterize bodily emotional aspects symptom chronology bodily location quality quantity setting aggravating alleviating factors associated manifestations
general clinician gather information clarifying seven dimensions area major concern
directive statement may needed direct coach patient information needed
detailed description symptoms help help
let start beginning
chronologic description provides framework characterizing course illness
interviewer obtain chronologic report asking problem first started facilitate continuing flow information questions happened
dating onset illness may difficult patients general estimate made
questions last feel really well
feel christmastime
help time onset illness
ask specifically patient ever similar symptoms past
chronology also includes duration symptomatic episode example minutes chest pain angina days chest pain rib fractures periodicity example pain early small bowel obstruction versus constant pain peritonitis whether symptom gotten better worse time
bodily location pain discomfort defined accurately possible
patient may encouraged indicate location radiation pain using hand gestures also indicate large area involved
remember patient may one pain multiple pains may indicate multiple disease processes
ask patient characterize differentiate
patients use analogies describe quality sensation
pain myocardial infarction often described similar vise tightening around chest someone standing chest
patient exact words important tightness assumed pain
try use patient vocabulary possible
patients use highly descriptive emotion laden terms like felt like someone stabbing knife
provides important clues patient emotional state reactivity
patients need interviewer help find descriptive language
providing patient choice descriptions pain sharp dull
may necessary although clinician realize limiting patient response two alternatives bias history
intensity pain estimated scale compared another pain patient experienced
scalar method particularly helpful following intensity symptoms time
examples quantity include volume example quantity sputum expectorated day number example number times patient lost consciousness degree impairment patient suffers
impairment disability best characterized terms patient usual daily activities dyspnea climbing stairs home chest pain sweeping floor
patients minimize others amplify quantity intensity symptomsimportant indicators emotional responses communication styles
setting symptoms occur often critical developing clear description illness
first felt ill
excellent questions use early interview
hypotheses regarding etiology symptoms frequently evolve understanding accompanying physical social emotional events surround episode illness
initial data makes symptom worse makes better flows patient spontaneous account
chest tightness brought exertion shortness breath night relieved sitting points specific pathologic processes effort angina paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
knowledge clinical syndromes sharpens physician ear clues provides basis directed line inquiry
example physician would ask patient reports sudden onset shortness breath chest pain four days fractured tibia pain pleuriticworsened deep breath cougha symptom associated pulmonary embolus
clinician also collects data concerning kinds help patient sought symptom types treatments already tried including prescribed counter medications
symptoms rarely occur singly
clinician listen groups related symptoms provide diagnostic clues pathologic processes involved organs
physician might ask joint pains notice anything else
patient response positive asked describe associated symptoms open ended questions
clarification obtained later using specific questions
even patient reports associated symptoms physician may decide ask directed questions help support reject given diagnostic possibility
patient complains joint pains physician might ask fevers
night sweats
rash
sensitivity sun
irritation eyes
negative answers often termed pertinent negatives may important positives defining nature severity illness
help rule rule specific diagnoses
several dimensions pursued comprehensive interview including patient emotional reactions illness patient means coping discomfort disability
patient reactions events often important events
addition patient thoughts fantasies may caused illness important understanding patient decided seek care
majority illness episodes treated outside physician office
problem oriented health promotion interviews interesting ask patient decided seek care
patients often specific perhaps unrealistic fantasies physician
interviewer try identify
patient explanatory model illness differing patient cultural group may significantly determine individual behavior illness affect compliance medical therapy
negotiation may bring doctor patient closer together kleinman et al
interviewer uses clinical discretion determining history present illness clearly defined
summarizing history useful way concluding section interview
go let see understand history
last march first noticed
summary gives patient chance check accuracy history gives physician chance review history gaps lack clarity
hpi completed physician collected great deal data remaining segments medical history past medical history family history social historypatient profile review systems
course new information may appear time
remainder interview physician directs patient fill blanks completing rest history
proceeding new section make clear transitional statement
example think ive got pretty good idea major problems developed
would like ask questions past health
transitional statements prepare patient coming next
review past medical problems treatments directly pertinent hpi completes past medical history
prior diagnosis diabetes mellitus patient gangrenous toe belongs hpi whereas remote appendectomy
past medical history defines data base future reference
major elements past medical history include childhood adult illnesses operations trauma allergies drug sensitivities characterized detail immunizations health maintenance example ppd status whether patient performs breast self examination routine pap smears sigmoidoscopies
medical problems family members reviewed special attention heritable disorders
furthermore patient reaction illness family may influence response personal medical problems
family history hypertension myocardial infarction would included hpi patient new onset chest pain
time limitations may preclude detailed inquiry health family member
use discretion family large elderly patients remember major purpose family history assess risk factors patient current future health
physician collects personal data patient complete patient profile
much information emerged patient describes story present illness gaps often apparent
social history portion interview physician gather data patient education occupation usual daily activities functional status relationships friends family social supports stresses financial statusinsurance coverage habits use cigarettes alcohol known health consequences
relevance patient health life adaptation guide interviewer deciding much information gather
concluding interview physician complete symptom checklist assure important areas patient physical psychologic health considered
clinicians prefer complete review systems examining patient may distracting beginning student
begin review systems open ended question problems havent discussed
patient mentions new problem symptoms characterized
transitional statement prepares patient next line questioning
move physical examination would like ask series questions specific health problems
stop one problems find
interviewer inquire system orderly fashion
questions ever headaches
may unwanted effect inspiring overly complete patient response
try providing direction limits following
would like ask recent health problems
severe headaches recently
entire review systems take less minutes physician begins open ended request information proceeding
patients positive review systemsproblems every area
may indicate emotional problems cause patient amplify symptoms use gain attention emotional support
closing interview ask patient anything else would like discuss questions
clinician proceeds physical examination
interestingly patients become quite talkative examination
seem reassured physician touch may feel ease sitting face face interview
examination specific body region system may remind patient previously forgotten details considerable diagnostic importance
alert physician take stethoscope ears long enough hear patient say
communication techniques critical importance physician reports findings history physical examination
diagnostic prognostic discussions effective tailored patient individual cognitive communication style
special emotional concerns discovered interview guide sensitive approach sharing news preparing future
physician knowledge patient person provides foundation patient education
real sense interview continues throughout clinical encounter
even skilled clinician may encounter problems interviewing patients
interview get back track clinician must recognize problem must find solution
interviewing problems roughly divided three categories
problems patient example intense emotional reactions altered mental status unrealistic fantasies doctor
problems interviewer example overly judgmental attitude directive approach questioning failure listen patient
problems physician patient relationship example language barrier failure negotiate shared goal encounter
given complexities interviewing process problems one category often found one encounter
first step solving problems recognize interview going well
recognition facilitated clinician assesses interview reference two major functions data gathering establishing supportive therapeutic relationship
first minutes interview clinician asks himherself following questions
established rapport patient
helping patient provide accurate unbiased report illness
collected enough data make accurate diagnostic hypotheses patient problems
clinician also monitors reactions interview
frustration anger boredom may signal troubled interview
problem recognized interviewer uses clinical reasoning establish nature problem may produced
effort diagnose problems interview parallels process diagnosing patient presenting problems chief complaint
like diagnostic processes defining problem based observations patient says patient says
clinician must step back mentally form hypotheses going wrong communication process
example interviewer may notice patient appears depressed withdrawn perhaps confused
may become evident interviewer feels negatively patient disapproves behavior distracted personal thoughts
problem recognized hypotheses generated etiology clinician tries solutions interview progresses
complete mental status examination may needed confused patient along decision interview patient family check reliability history
interpreter may needed language barrier
less directive interview style may required patient problems yet identified
limiting technique may employed patient rambles
clarifying highly directed questions may needed history vague
cultural differences may detected shared approach negotiated
physician limitations may defined patient makes unreasonable requests quill
frequently problems interview result patient emotional reactions illness medical encounter
patients experience considerable anxiety illness visiting doctor
patients feelings anger helplessness
responses vary severity illness past experiences personality current stresses supports
patient appears reticent talk may need emotional support
active non judgmental listening demonstrates physician interest concern encourages patient go talking
reassurance may provided interview proceeds attempt reduce patient anxiety
statements anyone would upset didnt know caused pain waiting biopsy results pretty tough patients may increase patient self esteem let know right share experiences physician
avoid false reassurance unrealistic promise happy outcome
obtain accurate information emotion laden issues physician may need roll carpet inviting patient honest answers
patients often respond defensively questions much drink
minimizing quantity please interviewer
rephrasing question less accusatory tone provides reassurance atmosphere acceptance
people stress find drink would like
ever experienced
sexual history patient often respond candidly statement patients heart problems find difficulties sexual function
problem
rather sex life
empathy closely related reassurance
empathic statements communicate physician recognition patient feelings provide feedback interviewer understands
empathy begins interviewer identifying patient emotional state
following statement communicates physician recognition acceptance patient feelings encourages exploration going look sad talk son
tell
pointing patient emotion form gentle confrontation
focuses attention aspect patient feelings communicated statements behaviors
since physician may point emotion patient unaware defensive appropriate timing critical
interviewer must prepared hostile response perhaps denial
nature response depends patient personality depth rapport established
patients often cry course medical interview
interviewer rush stop tears
often best let storm pass providing time emotional release crying provides
interview resume gentle questioning
general good avoid questions like feel angry sad
instead try rephrasing question seem angry
tell going
tell tears
gentle confrontation may needed address communication problems physician patient
example patient seems reticent talk issues seem important pointed follows
seem reluctant talk problems
wonder may uncertain whether trust
able help need know much possible problems
think proceed
statements identify problem confrontation suggest possible cause problem distrust establish physician need know invite patient participation deciding course interview take
principle sharing problems interview patient seldom practiced frequently effective
clinicians often feel rushed complete interview move activities
time limitations reality clinical medicine may possible complete data collection single encounter
many settings physician opportunity go back patient clarify history
patients encouraged reflect memories clarify much possible next visit
patients seem unaware physician time restraints
patient claim monopoly physician efforts must addressed
dependent patient may express wish time doctor especially follow visits reporting worrisome symptoms e g rectal bleeding exertional chest pain night sweats end appointment
recurrent behavior angers frustrates physicians jeopardize physician patient relationship
gentle confrontation may helpful modifying situation
last visits told worrisome symptoms right end appointment
real problem us doesnt give us chance discuss problems fully
id like decide problems would like hear coming next visit
ill ask list beginning appointment
given length appointments well decide problems cover wait later
statement establishes physician limits way also encourages patient active participation deciding utilize scheduled time
confusing traditional rigid order written medical history actual process information emerges medical interview
relying heavily directed closed questions
style discourages patient associations spontaneous report symptoms
ignoring patient emotional responses concerns interview process
narrowing scope inquiry early interview
failure clarify seven dimensions symptom patient words
insisting interview must accomplished one session
experienced clinicians return patient clarify history
limiting list diagnostic hypotheses adequate data collected
using questions leading complex double barreled unclear
failure follow basic courtesies interview lack clear introductions ignoring patient comfort failure establish atmosphere trust confidentiality
failure elicit patient ideas cause problem patient fantasies doctor
note taking interrupts flow interview
selected references follow elaborate extend many concepts discussed
student remember however clinicians learn conduct interviews actually interviewing patients supervision critical element educational process
engel compared learning interview patients learning play musical instrument
tasks require practice critical yet supportive assessment things going
review audio video recordings help student observe understand interviewing process
nowhere practice medicine self awareness important
learning process extends many years
finest clinicians find new reasons excitement humility new patient encounterwith challenge new interview
always good hear patient say ive finally found doctor really listens problems
despite technologic wizardry modern hospital difficult diagnostic puzzles often unraveled carefully conducted patient centered interview
