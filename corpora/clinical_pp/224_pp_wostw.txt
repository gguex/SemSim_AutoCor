decisions regarding immunizations travelers predicated upon evaluation endemic epidemic infections traveler target locale tables
consequently certain immunizations required countries arrival yellow fever cholera currently fall category immunizations required specific circumstances
immunizations required may recommended travelers others recommended persons high risk
vaccinations longer recommended travelers include smallpox bacillus calmette gu√©rin bcg
general travel western european countries new zealand australia japan canada constitutes greater risk travel within continental united states
conversely travel less socioeconomically developed nations constitutes increased risk acquisition many preventable infections particularly poliomyelitis hepatitis diphtheria measles mumps rubella
recommendations must individualized general guidelines published yearly health information international travelers obtained united states public health service
publication allows physician able make date recommendations vaccines travelers
females pregnant planning become pregnant immediate future potential contraindications immunization prophylactic medications must also considered
era acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids individuals high risk hiv infection may need hiv serology clinical assessment vaccines administered since immunization even healthy hiv infected patients although considered many safe may theoretically present risk
progressive infection live attenuated viruses may occur hiv infected patients may therefore especially dangerous patients aids immunocompromised states
risk poliomyelitis unprotected traveler mandates physician review patient vaccination status
two types polio vaccine available united states inactivated poliovirus vaccine ipv replaced enhanced form ipv known eipv live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine opv
adults previously completed full course primary vaccination opv may receive booster dose oral polio vaccine dose eipv alternative possibility departing areas poliomyelitis endemic epidemic
adult travelers received primary vaccination series immunized eipv since adult travelers slightly increased risk developing paralysis given oral polio vaccine estimated occur rate approximately one case per million doses
oral polio vaccine given patients significantly immunocompromised whether disease drug treatment
situations eipv given instead
although compelling data support teratogenicity polio vaccine vaccination nonimmunized pregnant women avoided unless unvaccinated pregnant traveler definitely exposed epidemic situation
tetanus toxoid injection administered ten years elapsed since last booster dose
combined formulation td including tetanus toxoid diphtheria toxoid recommended since many adults lack circulating levels protective antibodies diphtheria well tetanus
nonimmunized patients require full vaccine series
persons born prior assumed immune measles virus since measles essentially universal measles vaccine became available
persons born since documentation received live attenuated measles virus vaccine given subcutaneously since vaccine considered provide longlasting immunity vaccine recipients
persons vaccinated period one million united states citizens may require revaccination since received killed measles vaccine may adequately protected
unfortunately killed measles vaccine lacks enduring efficacy provided live attenuated measles vaccine
immunity rubella women childbearing ages established serologic proof prior international travel since risk infection considerably greater countries widespread rubella vaccination occurred
remember live measles rubella vaccines given pregnancy individuals immunodeficiency conditions
yellow fever vaccine may indicated instances required travel areas tropical africa central south america disease endemic
areas world active infection exists change frequently date information must obtained directly cdc publications
single injection attenuated live yellow fever vaccine provides immunologic protection infection ten years beginning approximately ten days following immunization
unfortunately significant rate adverse reactions including headache fever myalgias vaccine considered safe effective
since vaccine strain raised chick embryos persons hypersensitivity egg products receive yellow fever vaccine
furthermore vaccine contraindicated infants less one year age pregnant women unless extreme risk persons preexisting immunodeficiency state
letter written traveler physician stating vaccine contraindicated may required crossing borders
yellow fever vaccine recipients required international certificate vaccination issued official vaccine center

general cholera extremely rare occurrence u
travelers endemic epidemic areas
endemic areas include asia northern africa times southern europe
travelers normal gastric acidity considered low risk developing disease due vibrio cholerae
risk infection clearly higher persons take antacids histamine receptor antagonists postgastrectomy patients
cholera vaccine shown protective vaccinated persons duration three six months beginning six days immunization
countries require international certificates vaccination cholera single dose vaccine fulfills international health regulations
cholera vaccine rarely recommended except travel specific countries require vaccination entry immunization individuals considered especially high risk
parenteral typhoid vaccine available united states thought protective approximately recipients however vaccine usually recommended persons traveling areas substantial risk exposure typhoid anticipated
areas typhoid fever common include many regions africa asia central south america
primary immunization series consists two injections administered weeks apart
boosters required every years
recommendations could change either orally administered live vaccine current study strain tya intramuscular single dose purified vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine appear highly effective become available
adult travelers prophylaxis hepatitis obtained single intramuscular injection immune serum globulin dose depending upon length stay tropical developing country

diarrhea occurs approximately persons traveling high risk areas industrialized regions
common cause traveler diarrhea high risk areas enterotoxigenic escherichia coli followed strains shigella salmonella campylobacter e
coli capable producing disease mechanisms enterotoxin production
less common causes include giardia cryptosporidia rotavirus
amebiasis less common potentially severe cause gastrointestinal infection travelers
individuals may experience illness either travels soon return home
severity diarrhea presence blood mucus stool presence absence fever help determine likely etiologies turn lead helpful therapy
febrile illnesses likely associated invasive pathogens opposed produce effect primarily enterotoxin formation
diarrhea short lived usually bacterial viral whereas chronic disease course likely due protozoal e g amoebic giardial cryptosporidial infection helminthic e g coccidiosis ascaris trichuria infections infestations
times sprue like illness disaccharidase deficiency may present producing diarrhea malabsorption months even traveler returned home
frequency travelers diarrhea diminished selecting food beverages carefully especially traveling latin america asia africa
items usually considered safe include peeled citrus fruit food served steaming hot bread bottled beverages
similar guidelines followed eating meals prepared commercial airlines originate areas
bismuth subsalicylate pepto bismol effective prevention travelers diarrhea taken appropriate dose frequency
patients take medication warned advance possible side effects black stools mistaken melena
generally speaking use prophylactic antibiotics quinolones recommended tourists
although prophylactic antibiotics effective approximately travelers usually recommended travelers since risks antibiotic prophylaxis prevention diarrhea probably outweigh benefits
travelers however antibiotic prophylaxis may extremely helpful
travelers going high risk areas less two weeks increased susceptibility diarrhea e g achlorhydria gastric resection hypoglobulinemia receiving drugs like lithium diuretics digitalis may benefit prophylaxis
similarly patients antacids cimetidine like drugs may serious problems become dehydrated thus candidates prophylactic antibiotics
business traveler short trip afford spend time restroom may also candidate antibiotic prophylaxis
diarrhea occur nearly always self limited
