multiple indications performing lumbar puncture
examination csf useful patients suspected meningitis encephalitis neurosyphilis subarachnoid hemorrhage multiple sclerosis guillain barré syndrome meningeal carcinomatosis many processes may involve cns
lumbar punctures often performed patients unexplained seizures fever unknown origin dementia acute confusional states
csf examination performed follow various meningitides preface instituting anticoagulant therapy
therapeutically technique used treatment certain diseases diagnostically introduction contrast material
list incomplete address complex issues related perform test various conditions listed
contraindications must considered care performing lumbar puncture
procedure absolutely contraindicated infection skin overlying access site likelihood producing purulent meningitis
papilledema relative contraindication
papilledema caused pseudotumor cerebri lumbar puncture contraindicated may used part therapy
papilledema caused intracranial mass lesion another matter
mass lesions cause distortion obstruction ventricular system
interference intracranial pressure dynamics face displacement result production exacerbation tentorial cerebellar pressure cones leading death due brainstem compression
deterioration immediate occur within hours duffy
availability computed tomography ct solved large degree dilemma previously faced clinicians seeing patient papilledema diagnosis obscure
lumbar puncture performed degree safety presence papilledema ct scan demonstrates obstruction displacement ventricular system evidence mass lesion
bleeding diathesis relative contraindication lumbar puncture
platelet count lower greatly increases possibility spinal epidural hematoma occurring procedure
platelet count prothrombin partial thromboplastin times evaluated susceptible patients
appropriate replacement therapy instituted maintained suitable time event abnormalities
statements also apply patients anticoagulated therapeutic reasons
another relative contraindication severe pulmonary disease respiratory difficulty patient
optimum position patient significantly decreases pulmonary function
lumbar puncture approached great caution hypoxic patient
appropriate respiratory support measures undertaken procedure
assistant monitor respiratory function every moment spinal tap performed
performance lumbar puncture begins carefully explaining patient andor family indications complications technique procedure
many patients ingrained fear lumbar puncture based anecdotal accounts various mishaps
fear paralysis ranks high list patient concerns
painstaking explanation procedure couched language understandable particular patient usually alleviate anxieties
technique simple success often eludes operator meticulous position patient needle
three essential features must observed
patient must precisely horizontal
back patient must exactly perpendicular bed table
needle must inserted exact midline parallel horizontal plane
conscientious adherence points usually mean effortless virtually painless procedure
patient positioned hard surface bed table side craniospinal axis parallel floor
elevation head level spinal needle may falsely elevate csf pressure
assistant helpful maintaining neck thighs acutely flexed time keeping back vertical plane
greater degree flexion greater likelihood successbut bear mind cautions respect hypoxic patients
operator check position patient respect horizontal perpendicularity back horizontal plane positioning
importance strongly emphasized
sterile technique mandatory
area prepared local anesthesia used
small bleb made exact midline precisely spinal needle inserted
necessary infiltrate deeper subcutaneous tissues
spinal needle exact midline plane pain
occurrence pain skin penetrated immediately alerts clinician fact spinal needle properly positioned
optimal entry site midline l interspace crossed line connecting tops iliac crests
two lower spaces also usable
gauge needle recommended
stylet necessary
epidermoid tumors occasionally present midline
stylet prevents implantation tumor cells subarachnoid space
bevel needle pointed upward toward ceiling horizontal patient point slips fibers dura leaving smallest possible hole
midline necessary entry site
site avoids nerve roots fixed laterally exit spinal canal
importance lining needle exact right angle patient body emphasized
soon needle penetrates skin hub aimed umbilicus
pain part patient indication needle exact midline successful procedure
pain reassess position needle withdrawing subcutaneous tissue order redirect necessary
slowly advance needle till snap give felt approximately cm depth
sensation created penetration ligamentum flavum
stylus withdrawn

question free flow fluid assistant gently firmly compress patient abdomen
pressure immediately rise mm due increased pressure venous system rapidly fall abdominal pressure released
appears partial obstruction fluid flow gingerly rotate needle see free flow nerve fiber may blocking aperture
maneuver unsuccessful tinker gently position needle
note opening pressure

usual cause falsely elevated pressure abdominal compression resulting elevation venous pressure due either position anxiety consequent tensing abdominal musculature
assistant gently straighten legs
