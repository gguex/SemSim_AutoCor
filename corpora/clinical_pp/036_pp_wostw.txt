wheeze high pitched musical adventitious lung sound produced airflow abnormally narrowed compressed airways
wheeze synonymous high pitched sibilant rhonchus
asthma heterogeneous syndrome characterized variable reversible airway obstruction abnormally increased responsiveness hyperreactivity airways various stimuli
syndrome characterized wheezing chest tightness dyspnea andor cough results widespread contraction tracheobronchial smooth muscle bronchoconstriction hypersecretion mucus mucosal edema narrow caliber airways
resulting airflow obstruction may chronic episodic respiratory symptoms resolving either spontaneously result therapy bronchodilators corticosteroids
generally accepted definition asthma yet exist syndrome different causes mechanisms clinical features responses therapy
wheezing subjective complaint may described various ways
patients report noisy difficult breathing wheezy dyspnea whereas others describe whistling type breathing rattling secretions throat
majority asthmatic patients report active wheezing generally finding documented examining physician
nevertheless wheezing always present active asthma absence exclude diagnosis
patients chronic asthma may become accustomed wheezing volunteer information unless specifically asked
patients asthma complain frequently chest tightness combination shortness breath cough wheezing
thus patient chronic episodic respiratory symptoms presents history asthma chronic airway disease asked wheezing
diagnosis asthma usually obvious patient history
highly suspected description episodic variable respiratory symptoms without wheezing recurrent chest colds bronchitis productive cough

wheezing may result localized diffuse airway narrowing obstruction level larynx small bronchi
airway narrowing may caused bronchoconstriction mucosal edema external compression partial obstruction tumor foreign body tenacious secretions
wheezes believed generated oscillations vibrations nearly closed airway walls
air passing narrowed portion airway high velocity produces decreased gas pressure flow constricted region according bernoulli principle
internal airway pressure ultimately begins increase barely reopens airway lumen
alternation airways nearly closed nearly open produces fluttering airway walls musical continuous sound
flow rate mechanical properties adjacent tissues set oscillation determine intensity pitch composition monophonic polyphonic notes duration long short timing inspiratory expiratory early late dynamic symptom sign
wheezes heard commonly expiration airways normally narrow phase respiration
wheezing expiration alone generally indicative milder obstruction present inspiration expiration suggests severe airway narrowing
however asthmatic patients unable accurately correlate wheezing respiratory symptoms severity airway obstruction measured objectively pulmonary function tests
contrast absence wheezing asthmatic may indicate either improvement bronchoconstriction severe widespread airflow obstruction
latter suggests airflow rates low generate wheezes viscous mucus obstructing large regions peripheral airways
increasing exhaustion silent chest ominous signs respiratory muscle fatigue failure leading status asthmaticus
asthma markedly increased airway resistance airflow obstruction contributes characteristic physiologic clinical changes observed active symptomatic periods
airway obstruction diffuse nonuniform distribution resulting ventilation perfusion inequalities hypoxemia
airways tend close early expiration hyperinflation results
although breathing high lung volumes tends maintain open airways response demands increased muscular work breathing provide adequate ventilation increased secondary stimulation airway receptors hypoxia
asthmatics complain greater difficulty inspiration expiration due uncomfortable work breathing necessary ventilate hyperinflated abnormally stiff noncompliant lungs
several hypotheses proposed explain pathogenesis bronchoconstriction airway abnormalities asthma
none completely accounts clinical forms asthma
proposed mechanisms probably overlap interrelate even individual
immediate type immunologic reaction occurs primarily allergic asthma involves biochemical reactions antigen specific antibody immunoglobulin e ige bound sensitized airway mast cells basophils
immunologic reaction results release potent biochemical mediators contract bronchial smooth muscle increase vascular permeability mucus secretion attract inflammatory cells
preformed histamine neutrophil eosinophil chemotactic factors platelet activating factors released
addition membrane associated oxidative metabolism arachidonic acid generates prostaglandins pgfa pgd leukotrienes ltc e potent bronchoconstrictors
type iii arthus immunologic reactions also implicated cases asthma related allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
neurogenic reflex mechanism observed nonallergic asthma provoked nonspecific stimuli e g exercise infection air pollution apparently initiate type immunologic responses
nonimmunologic hypothesis stresses importance parasympathetic nervous system vagus nerve regulating airway caliber
chemical mechanical inflammation stimulates cholinergic irritant receptors airway mucosa hyperreact leading vagally mediated reflex bronchoconstriction
reflex produced either direct mediator release secondary stimulation irritant receptors smooth muscle constriction
partial beta adrenergic blockade deficiency also proposed explain types nonallergic asthma e g propranolol induced asthma bronchial smooth muscle tone appears modulated beta adrenergic receptors alterations metabolism intracellular cyclic nucleotides
beta adrenergic stimulation increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate amp decreases cyclic guanosine monophosphate gmp resulting smooth muscle relaxation bronchodilation
beta adrenergic inhibition produces opposite effects resulting bronchoconstriction
therefore asthmatics may relative beta adrenergic hyporesponsiveness imbalance adrenergic cholinergic regulation favor latter resulting greater normal mediator generation unopposed bronchoconstriction
although patients presenting acute asthma readily recognized diagnosed clinician must always cognizant wheezes asthma
almost respiratory disorder leads airway narrowing obstruction associated wheezing
differential diagnosis wheezing long table
times complicated particularly asthma coexists another pulmonary disease
wheezing may acute chronic recurrent children nonasthmatic disorders
acute wheezing small children suggests bronchiolitis particularly child well prior upper respiratory tract infection frequently respiratory syncytial virus relatively irreversible airway obstruction without evidence atopy
many children acute bronchiolitis may develop asthma long term course illness may best diagnostic determinant bronchiolitis usually recur
child wheezing prominent inspiration suggests laryngotracheobronchitis croup epiglottitis aspiration foreign body congenital laryngeal tracheal narrowing
wheezing occurs inspiration expiration airway caliber becomes increasingly smaller
wheezing may become confused stridor high pitched musical crowing sound localized larynx trachea
chronic wheezing respiratory infections child raise possibility cystic fibrosis without gastrointestinal complaints
adults new onset wheezing generally different nonasthmatic disorders children
adults stridor localized wheezing may caused mechanical obstruction central airway tumor foreign body especially food goiter stenosis
addition laryngeal edema resulting angioedema anaphylaxis vocal cord paralysis individuals may spastic adduction vocal cords due functional psychological factors
wheezing combination productive cough andor exertional dyspnea infrequent chronic bronchitis emphysema
patients may increased wheezing early morning hours nocturnal asthma result congestive heart failure pulmonary edema cardiac asthma gastric aspiration sinusitis recumbent position sleep promotes pulmonary sequelae
transient wheezing occurs patients pulmonary embolism carcinoid syndrome systemic mastocytosis result release bronchoactive amines mediators
parenchymal lung disorders sarcoidosis extrinsic allergic alveolitis adult respiratory distress syndrome non cardiogenic pulmonary edema occasionally produce wheezing due airway compromise granulomas edema fluid release mediators underlying asthma
large group diseases characterized pulmonary infiltrates peripheral blood eosinophilia may produce asthma like wheezing loeffler syndrome chronic eosinophilic pneumonia tropical eosinophilia hypereosinophilic syndrome various vasculitides allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
heterogeneity complexity asthma apparent one attempts classify various forms syndrome table
different categories asthma represent clinical spectrum majority patients features several forms
example although extrinsic intrinsic asthma popular conceptual terms many asthmatics conform either category may develop intrinsic asthma many years extrinsic features
extrinsic allergic asthma commonly occurs young patients allergic atopic disorders well family history asthma andor atopy
specific often seasonal antigen characteristically produces type hypersensitivity reaction resulting paroxysmal bronchoconstriction
eosinophils sputum eosinophilia increased ige positive skin tests immediate hypersensitivity common findings
intrinsic nonallergic infective asthma occurs primarily adulthood years age usually associated atopy seasons eosinophilia increased ige positive skin tests
patients hyperreactive wide variety stimuli intrinsic abnormality bronchomotor tone
many patients onset asthma preceded upper respiratory infection asthmatic symptoms tend persist years variations severity rather asymptomatic remissions
asthmatic bronchitis occurs elderly nonatopic patients long heavy smoking history active chronic cough sputum production superimposed hyperreactive airways
latter supported partial reversal airway obstruction bronchoconstriction inhalation challenge methacholine histamine
sinusitus sputum rich polymorphonuclear leukocytes rather eosinophils frequently present
allergy evaluation negative
exercise induced asthma occurs majority asthmatic patients exercise e g running cycling
wheezing dyspnea characteristically develop shortly completion sustained physical activity may symptoms asthma
severity symptoms depends duration type exercise recently individual previously exercised
phenomenon caused respiratory heat water loss releases mast cell mediators
drug induced asthma occurs patients shortly exposure certain medications e g propranolol timolol aspirin nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents cholinergic drugs additives e g tartrazine metabisulfite alcohol certain medical procedures e g studies using iodinated radiographic contrast dyes hemodialysis
patient wheezing temporally related aspirin ingestion rhinitis nasal polyps suggests aspirin hypersensitivity
foods may also contain potentially asthmagenic chemicals monosodium glutamate bisulfite preservative
general asthma related agents appear immunologic mechanism frequent adult nonatopic asthmatic patients
occupational asthma may provoked susceptible individuals following exposure irritants present work setting home
