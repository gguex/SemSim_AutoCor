perimetrist person measures visual field machine called perimeter
various perimetric techniques apparatus available
form testing however including confrontation field testing patients must continually urged maintain steady fixation straight ahead objects varying size color luminosity transcend visual threshold
kinetic perimetry objects moved outside boundary visual perception toward fixation

eye tested individually four steps
ask patient look nose count fingers held briefly area central fixation
move flash fingers four quadrants vision simultaneously encouraging patient maintain fixation nose
best flash one two five fingers three four fingers difficult distinguish
depict double simultaneous sensory stimulation hold hands inches cm apart flash fingers simultaneously nasal temporal hemifields
patient must maintain fixation

color perception refined sensitive parameter visual field function
relative lack color perception one eye one half visual field may salient manifestation active resolved intra cranial lesion
wards emergency room qualitative assessment color vision may obtained asking patient compare richness brightness primary color shown first right eye left
patient central cecocentral scotoma due optic nerve lesion usually report colored objects appear dimmer duller bright affected eye
comparison brightness richness color also used assess nasal versus temporal field perception
eye tested individually
order explore possibility hemianopic defect two similarly colored objects held patient one nasal temporal zone vision
patient instructed maintain fixation examiner nose tells whether two objects look whether one appears brighter duller
object intact hemifield usually described brighter richer hue perception darker duller object presents potential zone defective sight explored moving target area relatively poor saturation brighter area
done patient asked identify exact point moving object becomes bright companion stimulus
point transition carefully noted

interpret results perimetry accurately reader must firmly understand basic neuroanatomy visual pathway
primary visual sensory pathway humans consists retina optic nerves chiasm optic tract along lateral geniculate bodies geniculo calcarine radiations occipital cortex
secondary complex nerve fiber systems connect occipital striate cortex ipsilateral contralateral visual association areas
retina well differentiated stratified sensory membrane
incident light eventually stimulates ganglion cell layer retina axons ganglion cells course toward optic disk three basic patterns papillomacular bundle arises macula central point retina superior inferior arcuate bundle comes temporal retina radial fibers nasal retina figure
