association blood urine glucose first observed eighteenth century matthew dobson english physician
many years urine glucose testing major method used monitor glycemic control diabetes mellitus
early methods urine glucose detection included evaporation urine reveal sugar crystals urine sugar fermentation yeast
methods based copper reduction developed von fehling nineteenth century benedict turn twentieth century
ames company marketed clinitest copper reduction method followed clinistix glucose oxidase based determination
since several companies marketed glucose oxidase based tests
measurement glucosuria indirect index blood glucose concentration however tests urine glucose must interpreted caution
technical issues test sensitivity variability renal glucose threshold must taken account
furthermore social stigma sometimes associated handling body waste product consideration terms patient acceptance monitoring technique
limitations together development home blood glucose monitoring led decline use urine glucose monitoring diabetes mellitus
self monitoring capillary blood glucose preferred method
nevertheless assessment glucosuria produces usable data
especially appropriate monitoring tool health care settings socioeconomic educational constraints preclude use sophisticated techniques e g home capillary blood glucose monitoring glycosylated hemoglobin measurement frequent plasma glucose determinations
selected patients continue find urine glucose testing convenient noninvasive inexpensive useful
sample collection semiquantitative determination glucosuria hospital home take many forms hour collection overall control fractional collection hour blocks throughout day approximate control points first voided spot urine whose interval determined time since previous urination second voided spot urine assesses glucosuria specific short interval since discarded first void
many factors alter glucosuria time delay glucose filtration glomerulus appearance void surprising several studies indicate changes concentration glucosuria first second voided urine specimens accurately reflect documented change lack change plasma glucose
observations substantiated studies showing first second urine void tests glucosuria agree time
techniques measuring glucosuria based upon either glucose oxidase specific glucose copper sulfate reduction nonspecific detects reducing substances including glucose fructose lactose pentoses galactose homogentisic acid ascorbic acid

considerable literature substances alter validity tests glucosuria
conflicting reports often result effects different concentrations substance question subtle methodologic differences test procedures
however achieving urinary concentration substances alter test often difficult normal clinical circumstances
addition drugs listed table limited evidence suggests agents nalidixic acid probenecid chloral hydrate hyaluronidase nitrofurantoin pas phenazopyridine iodinated radiopaque agents interfere urine glucose testing
ciprofloxacin quinolone antibiotic related nalidixic acid interfere clinitest associated false positive reactions certain glucose oxidase tests
practical issues also alter test results clinitest angling dropper away vertical alter volumes critical accurate results b timing shaking alter available oxygen modify reaction c inattention may cause results missed nurses routinely performing simultaneous clinitest acetest procedures failed recognize pass phenomenon
errors color discrimination occur frequently glucosuria monitoring
patients age groups professionals read accurately extremes urine glucose concentrations
accuracy decreases true value approaches midrange test
errors groups underestimates
health care professionals trained balance error distribution implying hat errors inherent test procedures
acquired color vision deficiency caused diabetic retinopathy may contribute inaccuracies glucosuria testing factor
primarily blue yellow defect therefore involves tests glucosuria
severity diabetes related defect correlates significantly overall severity diabetic retinopathy well severity macular disease

however hue discrimination altered ambient light well age
reduced lighting decrease hue discrimination people normal color vision
although testing bright lighting improve results nondiabetics results diabetic individuals improved significantly
patients proliferate diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular disease probably higher risk test errors monitoring glucosuria
errors also stem falacious concept normal renal threshold
real variation renal thresholds glucose among individuals significant reason patients health care professionals find urine tests misleading frustrated data generated
significant trend patients higher renal thresholds glucose exhibit higher values glycosylated hemoglobin mean blood glucose glucosuria testing warn hypoglycemia diabetic patients tend maintain results near threshold values
therefore patients aim tight control glucosuria testing abandoned results consistently negative
management brought blood glucose point absent glucosuria alternative capillary blood glucose monitoring
although small amounts glucose present urine normal individuals term glucosuria conventionally reserved pathologic amounts urine glucose mgdl random fresh urine
renal tubule reabsorb almost glucose present normal glomerular filtrate
glucosuria occurs balance lost amount glucose glomerular filtrate exceeds capacity renal tubule reabsorb
balance lost either plasma glucose elevated e g diabetes mellitus absorptive capacity tubule impaired e g fanconi syndrome pregnancy hereditary renal glucosuria acute tubular injury
negative correlation renal glucose threshold creatinine clearance type diabetics
age heart failure renal disease e g diabetic glomerulosclerosis chronic hyperglycemia known raise renal threshold glucose
pregnancy hyperthyroidism fever exercise decrease
renal disease diabetic glomerulosclerosis reduced glomerular filtration rate decreases delivery glucose tubule given plasma glucose level
consequence normal tubular reabsorption filtered glucose allows plasma glucose value rise markedly usual threshold glucosuria occurs
thus age normal individuals glomerulosclerosis long standing diabetes associated raised renal threshold glucose presence amount glucose urine becomes lesser monitoring value
renal thresholds individual patients may may change short term patients proteinuria consistently lower renal thresholds mean mgdl deteriorating renal function normal individuals tends result increased threshold glucose
renal tubule capacity glucose reabsorption impaired constitutional acquired reasons glucosuria occur normal plasma glucose concentrations

patients recent onset type diabetes exhibited increase glomerular filtration rate maximal tubular reabsorptive capacity
addition reduced glomerular filtration rate long term diabetes accompanied lower maximal tubular reabsorptive rate
glomerulo tubular balance glucose maintained situations
proximal convoluted renal tubule reabsorbs filtered glucose load normally hyperglycemia
intermediate segment late proximal distal tubule also reabsorb glucose
acts buffer aid response increased glucose load overt glucosuria occur resorptive capacity exceeded
finally possible demonstrate correlation urine flow maximal tubular reabsorptive capacity renal threshold glucose
addition temporal lag significant rise plasma glucose increased glucosuria varies min
points deserve special attention attempting infer plasma glucose values results testing glucosuria unstable patients
glucose infusion studies dogs produced hyperglycemia raised glomerular filtered load near maximal tubular reabsorptive capacity without glucosuria
despite resultant reduced fractional proximal reabsorption therefore increased glucose egress proximal convoluted tubule excess glucose load reabsorbed intermediate segment renal tubule
excess filtered load could shown inhibit sodium fluid reabsorption proximal tubule
however sodium glucose reabsorption could dissociated equivalent infusions euglycemia maintained added insulin similar effect suggesting insulin mediation proximal inhibition sodium fluid reabsorption
rapid infusion hypertonic glucose elicits different hemodynamic responses normal diabetic patients
normal individuals raise renal plasma flow exhibit change glomerular filtration rate
diabetics exhibit change renal plasma flow experience fall glomerular filtration rate
changes groups produce significant decrease filtration fraction groups increase urinary sodium excretion glucose infusion
renal threshold glucose may exhibit wide individual variations change blood glucose necessary alter glucosuria may vary well
