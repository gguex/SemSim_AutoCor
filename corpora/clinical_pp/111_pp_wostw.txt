chapter discusses symptoms examination diagnostic thought processes involved evaluating patient experiencing alteration visual acuity
following terms frequently encountered setting visual acuity loss therefore worthy review
central visual acuity refers relatively small vital part visual field used reading tested conventional eye charts corresponds function macular area retina
marcus gunn pupil also called afferent pupillary defect marcus gunn pupil pupil shows greater consensual response direct response light
detected swinging penlight test described chapter
metamorphopsia subjective alteration shape form
photopsia sensation sparks flashing lights
usually seen periphery visual field often caused mechanical traction retina
scotoma focal area visual loss one eye
ocular media normally transparent structures eye including cornea crystalline lens vitreous
myopia
nearsightedness
hyperopia
farsightedness
presbyopia
loss ability focus near vision occurs universally increasing age
usually first symptomatic fourth fifth decades usually necessitates use glasses close viewing
rapidity onset symptoms nature visual symptoms among important historic features discussed
patients may include disparate symptoms loss acuity loss visual field metamorphopsia rubric poor vision pressed details
furthermore associated symptoms pain photophobia headache photopsia great value investigating visual loss
fundamental test central visual acuity patient visual disturbance determine blood pressure patient shock
ambulatory patients testing visual acuity feet eye chart optimal chapter
circumstances measuring visual acuity eye near visual acuity card appropriate sufficient
especially setting visual symptoms important obtain patient best possible visual performance
elderly poorly attentive patients must encouraged proceed far eye chart possible
exclude possibility simple refractive error e g nearsightedness accounting poor performance visual acuity testing vision must rechecked pinhole front tested eye minimize effect refractive error
one suspects malingering cause poor visual performance vision tested two distances
patient claims able read letters feet decreased level visual acuity allow reading letters feet
patient change visual acuity several aspects ophthalmic examination take additional importance
pupils must examined extraordinary care detect presence absence marcus gunn pupil
confrontation visual fields performed eye
ophthalmoscope used assess clarity ocular media absence red reflex suggests opacity ocular media
cataract observer view fundus correlates well visual loss attributed cataract
fundus systematically examined attention given optic disk retinal vasculature macula retinal pigmentation
specific attention addressed signs blurred disk margins disk hyperemia large cup disk ratio retinal pigmentary changes abnormal foveal light reflex
mechanisms visual loss diverse wide variety clinical entities cause
common cause subnormal visual acuity uncorrected refractive error
eliminate problem patient asked whether glasses previously worn retested pinhole minimize effect small refractive errors
understood presbyopia universal gradual loss accommodation manifests fourth fifth decades common cause decreased visual acuity close viewing distances easily corrected reading glasses
furthermore refractive errors may transient phenomena diabetics whose blood glucose recently elevated
due transient myopia caused reversible osmotic swelling crystalline lens accompanies hyperglycemia
return baseline vision occurs weeks better glucose control
ocular media must clear good visual acuity
corneal opacification often result previous infection trauma unusual cause decreased acuity detected penlight
common opacity ocular media cataract opacity crystalline lens
cataracts seen older population known cause
known causes secondary cataracts include corticosteroids radiation metabolic disorders ocular inflammation trauma
opacification vitreous gel cause medial opacity
usually result hemorrhage seen commonly diabetics abnormal retinal blood vessels neovascularization spontaneously bleed vitreous
vitreous hemorrhages clear spontaneously weeks months
however surgical treatment often needed address underlying cause neovascularization remove long standing hemorrhage
common cause irreversible visual loss united states age related macular degeneration
frequently bilateral disorder macula undergoes localized atrophy leading decreased central visual acuity
less frequently scarring macula result hemorrhage pathological neovascular membrane occurs
either case macular region retina irreversibly damaged central visual acuity diminished
retinal detachment unusual cause visual loss
patients high risk disorder include excessive myopia peripheral retinal degeneration previous ocular trauma including intraocular surgery
disorders vitreous traction retina may result retinal holes thereby leading retinal detachment
traction retina gives rise photopsia flashes light neurosensory elements retina mechanically stimulated
diabetic retinopathy common retinal vascular cause visual acuity loss
diabetes causes altered permeability retinal microvasculature resulting abnormally leaky vessels
vessels may predispose retinal edema located macular region causes decreased visual acuity
visual acuity also lost proliferative diabetic retinopathy abnormal vasculature proliferation causes fibrovascular membranes may bleed vitreous exert traction retina culminating retinal detachment
nondiabetic retinovascular disorders result decreased visual acuity
central retinal artery occlusion may either embolic thrombotic nearly always leads irreversible blindness affected eye
temporary occlusion retinal arterial supply cause amaurosis fugax symptom often described curtain coming one eye
vision spontaneously restored several minutes later
cholesterol emboli decreased carotid arteries often cause emboli ophthalmoscopically visible crystalline plaques retinal arterioles confirming diagnosis
loss visual acuity result obstruction central retinal vein causing diffuse retinal hemorrhages edema occlusion branch retinal vein hemorrhage edema localized macular region retina
glaucoma refers group disorders intraocular pressure sufficiently elevated cause irreversible optic nerve damage
progressive optic nerve atrophy initially causes loss visual field usually asymptomatic
loss central visual acuity occurs late course glaucoma often without preceding symptoms
however glaucoma may detected presymptomatic stage ophthalmoscopic evaluation optic disk cupping
cupping caused gradual atrophy axons forming optic disk rim causing increasing pallor atrophy neuroretinal tissue nerve
optic neuropathy may occur variety clinical settings
younger patients retrobulbar neuritis manifested acute visual loss association pain exacerbated eye movements inflammatory cause optic nerve dysfunction
recurrent accompanied neurologic signs symptoms suggests diagnosis multiple sclerosis
elderly acute optic neuropathy generally ischemic origin
classically presents monocular loss vision association altitudinal inferior superior visual field defect
occasionally acute ischemic anterior optic neuropathy manifestation temporal arteritis
intracranial causes visual acuity changes quite uncommon
large pituitary tumors aneurysms parasellar masses cause compressive neuropathy involving optic nerves chiasm tracts resulting visual field loss occasionally loss central visual acuity
lesions invoking temporal parietal occipital cortices cause homonymous hemianopic visual field loss
though sparing central vision lesions visually disturbing patient
diagnosis contingent upon results confrontation visual field testing
may ultimately require ophthalmologist make definite diagnosis patient disturbance visual acuity nonophthalmologist often determine correct diagnosis proper diagnostic thinking directed examination
diagnosis setting visual acuity change important many conditions successfully treated recognition referral
relatively acute processes cause severe bilateral simultaneous loss visual acuity
frequently patients presenting acute bilateral loss acuity aware prior visual loss one eye seek medical attention second eye affected
truly acute conditions causing bilateral simultaneous loss vision include nutritional deficiency thiamine methanol quinine toxicity optic neuritis affecting chiasm
sudden monocular loss visual acuity younger patient suggests optic neuritis retinal detachment
optic neuritis variable severity visual loss accompanied retrobulbar pain exacerbated eye movements associated marcus gunn pupil
retinal detachment typically preceded floaters photopsia partial may present loss visual field one eye
loss change visual acuity diabetic patient multiple causes
common visual disturbance diabetic blurred vision caused periods hyperglycemia
onset diabetes mellitus determined helpful know diabetic retinopathy usually occur years following onset diabetes
common cause decreased visual acuity diabetic retinal edema sometimes improved laser therapy
neovascularization retina result vitreous hemorrhage may result severe loss visual acuity
alternatively neovascularization lead traction retinal detachment
modern vitreoretinal microsurgery often address chronic vitreous hemorrhage traction retinal detachment diabetic
acute visual acuity change older patient associated ocular conditions
macular degeneration common irreversible cause blindness united states present sudden monocular loss vision caused subretinal neovascularization hemorrhage
laser therapy may helpful affected eye fellow eye undergo similar changes many patients
retinovascular disease also cause sudden loss vision elderly
central retinal artery occlusion true ophthalmic emergency necessitating ophthalmic care within hours vision restored
central retinal artery occlusion often presents profound instantaneous loss vision associated marcus gun pupil cherry red spot fundus
venous retinal occlusion complete incomplete associated visual loss diffuse retinal edema hemorrhages
acute ischemic anterior optic neuropathy another cause sudden monocular visual loss older population
occlusion may arteric thrombotic patients therefore require work temporal arteritis
clinically loss superior inferior visual field marcus gunn pupil optic disk swelling
painless gradual nonsimultaneous loss visual acuity also seen elderly
patients usually cataract glaucoma macular degeneration
cataract associated obscuration funduscopic view proportion patient visual acuity glaucoma subjective visual loss associated advanced cupping optic disk
macular degeneration diagnosed ophthalmoscopic abnormality macula including increased pigmentation decreased pigmentation atrophy
