salivary glands exocrine glands part digestive system include three major paired glands parotid submandibular sublingual glands
also many smaller minor glands oral cavity pharynx larynx
diagnosis diseases salivary glands depends careful history examination glands effluent
patient main complaint pain examiner try determine onset duration symptoms particularly try establish relationship eating since salivary flow increases time
fever chills
sign facial weakness paralysis
facial nerve passes parotid gland anatomical relationship also considered
sometimes initial presenting sign parotid gland must carefully examined signs neoplasm
major salivary glands best examined palpation observation salivary effluent palpation
parotid gland submandibular glands examined way
parotid gland lies lateral surface mandibular ramus folds around posterior border mandible
generally soft usually palpable discrete gland
anterior border gland may better defined patient clench teeth together tenses masseter muscle
parotid gland lies behind masseter consistency may appreciated pressing gland lateral surface vertical mandibular ramus
parotid secretions carried oral cavity stensen duct enters oral cavity cheek opposite upper second molar tooth
visible small papilla buccal mucosa
careful observation papilla palpation gland usually reveal saliva coming small duct orifice
sometimes helpful dry mucosa vicinity duct dry gauze sponge order visualize flow easily
saliva parotid gland usually clear thin colorless
clinician look carefully pus mucus particulate matter secretion
submandibular gland resides inferior border mandibular body best palpated bi manually one hand lateral floor mouth submandibular gland
gland usually soft mobile tender palpation
submandibular duct wharton duct runs superiorly anteriorly empty adjacent frenulum tongue
small duct orifice visible top papilla area
observation salivary flow palpation helpful
submandibular gland commonly associated stone formation glands gland secretion mucoid gland lies dependent position relative duct orifice
leads stasis secretions proximal duct
sublingual glands lie beneath mucosa floor mouth empty directly mouth submandibular duct
gland discretely palpable duct openings usually visible
salivary glands secrete saliva serves lubricant chewing swallowing
saliva largely water also contains electrolytes muicin digestive enzymes notably amylase
enzymes important digestion carbohydrates
saliva essential good dental health helping clean teeth well maintaining ph discourages dental decay
formation saliva complex phenomenon
crystals form within saliva create nidus stone formation similar urinary tract
stones lead obstruction duct rapid swelling pain gland ultimately infection
commonly occurs submandibular system rarely sublingual gland
infection also occur absence stone formation
fact anything decreases salivary flow lead infection
elderly population atrophy glands drug effects well dehydration produce low flow state lead suppurative bacterial parotitis
also primary viral infections affect salivary glands notable mumps acute epidemic parotitis
mumps self limited infection characterized unilateral bilateral parotid swelling fever sometimes orchitis
salivary glands capable extremely wide range neoplastic expression benign malignant diagnosis salivary gland mass depends histopathologic appearance
parotid gland appearance mass gland facial weakness suggestive malignant neoplasm
rare facial weakness occur benign tumors
diffuse parotid enlargement without pain occur association number conditions
alcoholism malnutrition diabetes obesity fatty infiltration salivary gland hypertrophy produce enlargement glands particularly parotid
sj√∏gren syndrome mikulicz disease may also produce diffuse localized enlargement glands
syndrome characterized dry eyes mouth may accompanied numerous autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus polymyositis
histopathologically glands show intralobular ductal epithelial hyperplasia lymphocytic infiltration gland
