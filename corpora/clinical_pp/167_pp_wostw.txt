two methods commonly used wintrobe method westergren method
westergren method declared superior method international committee standardization hematology
westergren method requires collecting ml venous blood tube containing

wintrobe method performed similarly except wintrobe tube smaller diameter westergren tube mm long
anticoagulated blood without extra diluent drawn tube rate fall erythrocytes measured millimeters hour
correction anemia since tube short may necessary low hematocrit cause esr appear greater
shorter column also makes method less sensitive westergren method maximal possible abnormal value lower

rate fall erythrocytes column blood influenced extent erythrocytes aggregated
three major factors influence erythrocyte aggregation surface free energy red cells surface charge red cells dielectric constant medium cells suspended
surface free energy red cells acts attracting force due van der waals forces whereas negatively charged surface red cells acts repel cells
positively charged cloud surrounds negatively charged cells two charges result zeta potential
dielectric constant medium acts dissipate charges
dielectric constant affected concentration symmetry plasma proteins
asymmetrical plasma proteins cause increase dielectric constant polarizing red cells thereby diminishing repulsive forces red cells facilitating agglutination

asymmetric acute phase protein fibrinogen greatest effect esr
acute phase proteins especially alpha gamma globulins may also enhance aggregation present large concentrations
esr influenced several factors plasma proteins
alterations shape red cells may prevent aggregation resulting normal esr regardless presence acute phase reactants

since high levels immunoglobulins also cause elevation esr lymphoproliferative disorders multiple myeloma waldenström macroglobulinemia also considered patients markedly elevated esr
however patients obvious inflammatory disease may normal esr

major histocompatibility complex mhc located short arm chromosome humans
genes coded region determine structure antigens found cell surface human leukocytes hla cells
three major classes hla class includes gene products encoded b c loci class ii includes molecules encoded region genes class iii includes complement molecules
three subregions locus called dp formerly sb dq dr
dq dr regions shown code region alloantigen systems mb mt dc te br
products b c loci glycoprotein antigens associated b microglobulin surface nucleated cells platelets
products region loci composed two polypeptide chains b found surface b cells macrophagesmonocytes activated cells cell types
multiple alleles many gene loci identified
group alleles located single chromosome either maternal paternal origin called haplotype
alleles individual homozygous gene alleles different heterozygous
genes define genotype individual expression genotype phenotype
usually alleles expressed thus codominant
world health organization hla nomenclature committee responsible officially approving allele
antigen named according gene locus letter allele number e g b dr
letter w locus designation indicates antigen recognized provisionally nomenclature committee except case c loci w used distinguish hla antigens terminology used complement components
technique identifying class antigen specificities requires use alloantisera antibody activity specific hla
sera usually obtained multiparous women exposed foreign hla
standard technique microcytotoxicity assay
multiple alloantisera specificity hla b c antigens placed wells microtiter plates incubated peripheral blood lymphocytes individual
complement added following incubation dye added taken dead cells killed alloantibodies
alloantisera specificity antigen lymphocyte surface elicit killing cells

functions class class ii antigens known largely studies animals appear similar humans
generally class antigens function recognition antigens graft rejection cell mediated lysis killer lymphocytes
perhaps important class antigens function recognition sites viruses
order cytotoxic lymphocytes kill virus infected cells recognize antigen context class antigen cytotoxic lymphocytes must bear identical class antigen
class ii antigens function presentation antigen cells macrophages recognition sites interaction immunocompetent b cells
reasons association certain hla antigens specific diseases unknown
one hypothesis presence specific cell surface antigens determines type response lack response foreign self antigen thereby leading pathologic condition production autoantibodies
another hypothesis specific hla antigens act receptors agents viruses toxins foreign substances etiologic certain diseases
third possibility hla antigens structurally immunologically similar agent cause disease
agent recognized self immune response results agent could cause pathologic effects without interference
alternative response could recognition exogenous agent foreign thereby resulting immune response cross reacts self resulting autoimmune phenomena
another mechanism hla genes may predispose autoimmunity called transcomplementation transassociation
certain b chains different class ii molecules become paired immune response may result likely cause disease

determination hla types patients diseases unknown etiology done primarily research purposes attempts characterize disease better understand etiology
closely linked association hla b antigen ankylosing spondylitis
least patients ankylosing spondylitis b positive
association b similar spondylitides reiter syndrome spondylitis psoriatic arthritis spondylitis inflammatory bowel disease lower
isolated peripheral joint arthritis latter two conditions associated hla b however
hla b present american caucasian population american black population
approximately b positive individuals likely develop clinically significant ankylosing spondylitis
test determining presence b antigen expensive arguments made utility test differential diagnosis ankylosing spondylitis since disease could still present b negative patient majority b positive individuals develop disease
used routine screening test may helpful confirming clinical suspicion diagnosis clear
examples include presence apparently inflammatory low back pain young patients sacroiliac roentgenographic changes present incomplete reiter syndrome patients lack extraarticular signs disease juvenile arthritis patients seronegative rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibody prognostic indicator desired
another clinical situation determination hla type may useful applies rheumatoid arthritis
whereas dr antigen shown associated seropositive rheumatoid arthritis incidence hla dr positivity reported high rheumatoid arthritis patients develop proteinuria thrombocytopenia gold therapy proteinuria penicillamine therapy
presence dr antigen patient developed proteinuria due gold therapy would suggest penicillamine therapy might also cause proteinuria
