tonometry refers indirect estimation intraocular pressure measuring resistance eye indentation applied force
crude level palpation eyeball fingertips estimating turgidity form tonometry
accurately safely intraocular pressure estimated variety instruments mechanically deform globe relate intraocular pressure either force required deform eye area eye deformed force
classification tonometers according eyeball deformed indented flattened
prototype indentation tonometer familiar schiotz instrument whereas tonometers measure intraocular pressure flattening cornea known applanation tonometers
several applanation tonometers commercially available recognized gold standard goldmann apparatus used american ophthalmologists
represented neither classifications noncontact tonometers
instruments produce jet air deforms cornea intraocular pressure estimated amount time necessary indent eye
primary care physicians use schiotz tonometer ease use relative low cost therefore use characteristics described greatest detail
measuring intraocular pressure schiotz tonometer needs calibrated sterilized
calibration simply done placing footplate instrument rounded metal stand artificial cornea provided storage case
footplate resting stand correctly calibrated instrument scale reading zero
following calibration footplate sterilized flame alcohol ether
care must taken ensure footplate cool dry placing cornea
following preparation instrument patient prepared

fine oscillations needle represent ocular pulsations indicating free movement plunger good technique
midpoint needle excursion taken pressure measurement
standard force plunger producing corneal indentation
g weight
globes elevated intraocular pressure resistant denting plunger resulting inaccurate measurements
three larger plunger weights provided instrument added standard
g weight increase total plunger weight g
extra weights used whenever pressure reading instrument scale less
since schiotz tonometer measure pressure directly conversion tables supplied instrument used translate scale readings estimates intra ocular pressure
two conversion tables available published
studies shown table closely approximates pressures obtained goldmann applanation tonometry
patients known suspected ocular infection trauma known sensitivity topical anesthetic schiotz tonometry performed primary care physician
procedure contraindicated patients inhibit blinking increased risk corneal abrasion
actual complication rate tonometry quite small estimated large screening programs less includes corneal abrasions infections drug sensitivity
pressure readings taken standardized format recording data strongly recommended includes scale reading tonometer weight intraocular pressure conversion table eye measured
typical measurement would recorded follows
mm hg
although technicians trained use schiotz instrument user inexperience considerable source measurement error
even experienced user however interinstrument interexaminer errors magnitude mm hg possible
factors external instrument responsible similarly large errors due force needed overcome natural resistance sclera independent ocular pressure
example refractive errors including hyperopia myopia increase decrease scleral rigidity respectively
corneal disease past ocular operations alter resistance indentation additional source measurement error
magnitude times unpredictable direction measurement errors indicate caution used interpreting results
may prudent assume schiotz tonometer indicate probable range intraocular pressures tonometry measurements sufficient make diagnosis glaucoma

mm hg
unfortunately sake simplified risk assignment frequency distribution intraocular pressures gaussian slightly skewed right confidence level extends mm hg
however

two major dichotomous classifications glaucoma useful primary care physician primary versus secondary glaucoma open angle versus closed angle glaucoma
primary glaucomas occur without previous ocular systemic disease
secondary glaucomas result conditions considered causative ocular inflammation trauma diabetic neovascular formation corticosteroids occasionally tumors
patients secondary glaucoma often already established ophthalmologist rarely pose diagnostic problem primary physicians
primary glaucomas classified either open angle closed angle referring angle iris assumes relation cornea trabecular network figure
primary open angle glaucoma single type likely encountered primary care physician accounting approximately glaucoma cases
also known chronic simple glaucoma primary open angle glaucoma heritable tendency probably due degenerative changes trabecular network reduce flow aqueous humor eye
closed angle glaucomas characterized shallow anterior chamber forces root mid dilated iris forward trabecular network obstructing drainage aqueous humor thereby increasing intraocular pressure
shallow anterior chamber anatomical clue presence closed angle glaucoma
frequently suspected shining light obliquely across face iris illuminate normal iris proximal half iris abnormally bowed forward figure
diagnosis closed angle glaucoma confirmed ophthalmologist using technique gonioscopy whereby contact lens placed cornea help visualize measure angle iris cornea
although relatively rare closed angle glaucomas important surgically curable
additionally administration mydriatrics even systemic anti cholinergics adrenergics unwary physician may precipitate devastating attack acute closed angle glaucoma
disease glaucoma fulfills many characteristics suitable screening efforts primary care physicians
glaucoma common serious disease long asymptomatic phase detected available screening techniques
ideally efforts disease screening limited conditions preventable curable treatment asymptomatic phase superior treatment symptomatic phase
glaucoma neither preventable curable prevailing expert consensus advises controlling ocular pressure prevent serious complications disease
test tonometry fits many criteria good screening tool
capable detecting disease asymptomatic phase capable excluding disease normal population
tonometry affordable available finally acceptable patients
population risk deserving screening individuals age patients family history glaucoma myopic patients patients using ocular systemic corticosteroids diabetics
blacks found many studies increased prevalence glaucoma included high risk category purposes screening
addition screening older asymptomatic individuals individuals high risk patients presenting eye pain red eye corneal cloudiness loss vision immediate measurement intraocular pressure
choice screening level separating patients high risk low risk categories point arbitrary decision
best screening cutoff point sensitive capable identifying patients disease positive test result specific capable excluding normal patients negative test result
unfortunately measurements normal diseased populations overlap perfect distinction two made
physician therefore confronted dilemma
attempts establish cutoff point designed identify diseased patients positive test invariably label proportion normal individuals diseased false positives reducing specificity
gonversely designating cutoff level reliably identify normal individuals negative test inappropriately label number diseased individuals normal false negatives reducing sensitivity
example screening level
mm hg corresponding schiotz scale reading
g weight expected sensitive specific diagnosis glaucoma
decreasing screening level mm hg corresponding schiotz scale reading increases sensitivity decreases specificity
least one investigator recommended separate screening levels created decade age corresponding tendency intraocular pressure increase age
one objections method varying cutoff level age inherent inaccuracy schiotz tonometer instrument capable reliably detecting small differences pressures correspond changes observed aging
screening level
mm hg patients generally recommended tonometry combined ophthalmoscopic evaluation optic disk combination two screening tests unlikely miss cases glaucoma false positive test results reduced reasonable minimum
screening tonometry logically begin age since prevalence ocular hypertension increases approximately age continues increase subsequent decade
individuals normal screening levels ocular pressure would reasonable repeat tonometry every years annually age
little data support recommendation increasing prevalence ocular hypertension ages prolonged time thought necessary ocular hypertension produce visual loss
patients asymptomatic elevations ocular pressure need followed carefully
pressure elevation persistent year greater mm hg accompanied funduscopic changes referral ophthalmologist indicated
measurements schiotz tonometer produce rather large errors remains preferred screening instrument primary care physicians
accuracy problems assume lesser importance compared difficulty knowing exact relationship elevated intraocular pressure development glaucoma
schiotz tonometer capable providing measurements accurate enough screen disease long latency period producing symptoms
instrument relatively inexpensive competency gained minimum effort acceptable patients
goldmann applanation tonometry remains gold standard requires slit lamp considerable amount operator experience attain competency
noncontact tonometers accurate screening devices reliably operated paramedical personnel expensive readily available primary physicians
