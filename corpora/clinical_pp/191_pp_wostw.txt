small quantities albumin normally filtered glomerulus reabsorbed proximal tubule
protein escapes reabsorption exceed mg hr proteinuria excess amount regarded pathologic
two semiquantifiable methods generally employed detect albumin dipstick method sulfosalicylic acid precipitation
older heat test still valid generally used
involves demonstration ring precipitate urine test tube exposed flame confined narrow segment tube
dipstick method colorimetric reagent strip based ability proteins alter color certain acid base indicators tetrabromophenol blue without changing ph
dye buffered ph yellow addition increasing concentrations protein changes color green blue
developed color compared color chart allows protein concentration graded trace corresponding concentrations mgdl greater mgdl
sulfosalicylic acid test requires centrifugation urine followed addition
ml supernatant
ml sulfosalicylic acid
degree turbidity quantified follows
tests subject caveat concentration protein tested
dilute urine lower concentration protein absolute rate excretion
test also subject false negative false positive reactions
sulfosalicylic acid test gives false positive reaction x ray contrast media penicillins tolbutamide sulfasoxazole p aminosalicylic acid present urine
test appropriately show positive reaction presence light chains
dipstick hand detect light chains since specific albumin
quantitative measurements performed accurately timed hour urine collection
patient well hydrated drinking least
l fluid period accuracy collection enhanced
urinary excretion increased amounts kappa lambda light chains also known bence jones protein suggested positive sulfosalicylic acid test negative dipstick test
positive sulfosalicylic acid test indicates presence globulins false positive reactions excluded
determine presence light chains heat test required
test based upon fact proteins precipitate °c redissolve temperature raised boiling point
perform heat test urine must first acidified adding ml acetate buffer ml filtered urine
mixture heated °c water bath minutes
heating mixture minutes °c clearing precipitate occurs bence jones protein present
boiling mixture filtered become cloudy cools
large amounts albumin present disappearance bence jones protein precipitate may obscured similarly amount bence jones protein excessive may dissolve boiling urine needs diluted obtain positive result
definitive tests immunoglobulins urine electrophoresis immunoelectrophoresis
normal individuals albumin constitutes third urinary protein alpha alpha globulins half
beta gamma components include microglobulins well light chains
monoclonal protein appears dense narrow band generally wider observed serum
tubular abnormalities urine electrophoresis shows small amount albumin significant amounts light chains
glomerular disease characterized predominantly albuminuria globulins may also present urine
identity abnormal protein urine best determined immunoelectrophoresis concentrated urine
procedure may positive even standard electrophoresis negative definitive test establish presence absence light chains whether monoclonal polyclonal
although dropsy anasarca recognized common presentation disease many centuries richard bright first pointed certain cases edema due disease kidney bright disease diagnosis renal origin edema may made demonstrating presence albumin urine
classic text reports medical cases view illustrating symptoms cure diseases reference morbid anatomy first show systemically heating urine teaspoon led formation precipitate addition acid urine also caused precipitation urine contained albumen
albumen thus spelled denote similarity egg protein molecule called albumin
proteinuria may categorized glomerular origin e caused increase glomerular permeability macromolecules tubular origin latter designation usually referring impaired reabsorption protein filtered normal amounts due tubular dysfunction
proteinuria categorized according nature excreted protein may albumin globulins kappa lambda light chains tamm horsfall protein
latter protein formed ascending limbs loops henle released area nephron damaged thus another form tubular proteinurea
differential diagnosis proteinuria shown table
primary diagnostic procedure concomitant testing urine sulfosalicylic acid dipstick
former positive albuminuria excluded differential diagnosis monoclonal light chain diseases
tests positive albumin present proteins including light chains may also present
patients age essential exclude postural proteinuria benign prognosis associated minor degree proteinuria
urine sediment normal make diagnosis
test orthostatic proteinuria involves urine collection evening followed confinement bed next morning recumbent sample obtained
patient allowed ambulate hours third sample obtained
presence protein first third sample absence second confirms diagnosis orthostatic proteinuria
functional proteinuria term applied transient proteinuria accompanies fever exercise congestive heart failure probably hemodynamically mediated within kidney
proteinuria rarely exceeds mg hr resolves initiating event reversed
persistent proteinuria present complete urinalysis including careful inspection urinary sediment mandatory
