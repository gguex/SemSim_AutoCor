aminotransferases transaminases group enzymes catalyze interconversion amino acids oxoacids transfer amino groups
aspartate aminotransferase ast formerly termed glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase got alanine aminotransferase alt formerly termed glutamate pyruvate transaminase gpt two aminotransferases greatest clinical significance
pyridoxal phosphate pp functions coenzyme amino transfer reactions
amino transfer reactions oxoglutarate l glutamate serve one amino group acceptor donor pair
specificity individual enzymes determines specific amino acid serves amino group donor
ast reaction l amino acid aspartate alt alanine

transaminase reaction directly monitored however continuous monitoring assays achieved coupling self indicating enzyme systems utilize substrate either glutamate specific oxoacid formed transaminase reaction
kinetic assays utilizing coupled enzyme systems commonly used clinical laboratories
older methods using colorimetric detection transaminase reaction products without continuous reaction monitoring obsolete
proposed reference methods also recommend addition pyridoxal phosphate reagent system order activate enzyme
however modification introduces technical problems compromises established clinical experience uniformly adapted
reagent addition coenzyme increases enzyme activity ast normal serum ast
greater changes may occur patient serum low levels pyridoxal phosphate caused precursor vitamin b deficiency
serum specimen choice
vitro hemolysis causes spuriously increased activity enrichment erythrocyte aminotransaminase
heparinized edta citrated oxalated plasma generally acceptable may cause problems specific reagent instrument systems
serum transaminase activity stable room temperature several hours days Â°c
freezing may result loss activity recommended
aminotransferases catalyze redistribution nitrogen amino acids corresponding oxoacids participating protein metabolism gluconeogenesis
ubiquitous cellular distribution
tissue activity ast follows decreasing concentration heart liver skeletal muscle kidney pancreas spleen lung erythrocyte
two distinct forms identified cytoplasmic soluble isoenzyme mitochondrial isoform
selective measurement isoenzymes currently demonstrated clinical application
distribution relative tissue concentration alt similar importantly different
highest activity found liver followed kidney myocardium skeletal muscle pancreas spleen lung erythrocyte
alt activity found cytosol organ organelle specific isoenzymes demonstrated
concentration alt hepatic cell cytoplasm comparable ast however mitochondrial alt isoform found
tissues alt activity significantly less ast
primary clinical application serum ast alt measurement detection differential etiologic diagnosis hepatic disease
hepatic cell injury manifested elevated serum transaminase activity prior appearance clinical symptoms signs jaundice
comparable elevations ast alt highly characteristic acute viral toxic nonethanol drug induced hepatitis
similar serum transaminase levels conditions thought caused cellular release cytoplasmic enzymes associated reversible hepatic cell damage
chronic hepatitis cirrhosis serum ast levels higher alt may reflect hepatic cell necrosis release mitochondrial ast
alcohol hepatitis ast significantly increased alt
cholestatic lesions associated either intrahepatic posthepatic diseases manifested modest transaminase elevations ast usually exceeding alt
conditions elevations serum alkaline phosphatase alp gamma glutamyltransferase ggt dramatic
since aminotransaminases ubiquitous cellular distribution serum elevations may occur variety nonhepatobiliary disorders
however elevations exceeding times reference uncommon absence hepatic cell injury
since concentration alt significantly less ast cells except hepatic cytosol alt serum elevations less common nonhepatic disorders
following myocardial infarction ast activity consistently increased alt associated passive congestion liver
ast occasionally alt serum activity increase inflammatory skeletal muscle diseases progressive muscular distrophy
measurement serum alt activity routinely used screen blood donors risk transmitting hepatitis particularly non non b type since specific serologic test available
use alt surrogate test non non b hepatitis expectedly reduces incidence post transfusion hepatitis
