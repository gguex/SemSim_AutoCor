topics presented chapter chest roentgenography pulmonary evaluation
despite ever increasing number new diagnostic imaging techniques available today clinician chest x ray remains simple easy inexpensive informative examination
areas replaced sensitive techniques example sonography evaluation pericardial effusions
still chest roentgenogram provides invaluable information part crucial first step differential diagnosis following progression disease

give false positives particularly film taken poor inspiration
degree inspiration greatest effect apparent heart size
optimal film would diaphragm posterior tenth rib maximal inspiration eliminate pseudocardiomegaly pulmonary plethora
causes false impression cardiomegaly greater magnification heart ap film
good estimate cardiomegaly heart greater cm transverse diameter greater cm increase size one year
identification individual chamber enlargement fraught many difficulties often impossible specify chamber enlarged
certain things ascertained relative ease
pa view right heart border formed right atrium left heart border formed appendage left atrium superiorly left ventricle inferiorly
lateral view anterior cardiac border formed right ventricle posterior heart border left atrium superiorly carina left ventricle inferiorly
enlargement individual chambers usually reflected globular bulge expected position chamber example right ventricle expand fill retrosternal space lateral view
massive right ventricular enlargement additional rotation heart
causes portion right ventricle show right heart border left ventricular silhouette disappear e rotated posteriorly pa view
adult cause isolated right ventricular enlargement usually cor pulmonale therefore pulmonary outflow tract often central hilar vessels also enlarged
left ventricular enlargement expands left heart border pa view figure
inferior posterior border lateral
probably common isolated chamber enlargement adults
occurs frequently ischemic heart disease systemic hypertension
tends give heart boot shaped appearance pa view
however significant hypertrophy restrictive cardiomyopathy without chamber enlargement
left atrial enlargement reflected earliest enlargement appendage pa view
difficult see posterior bulge lateral view carina
often obscured slight patient rotation hilar vessels
classic often seen signs left atrial enlargement double density widening angle carina pa view
double density shadow left atrium seen right atrial shadow right carina pa view
normal carinal angle said degrees obtuse angle reflecting left atrial enlargement
however poor inspiratory excursion also cause increased angle making sign limited usefulness
prominent left atrial appendage pa view probably consistent sign enlargement
common cause isolated left atrial enlargement mitral valve disease
often significant left atrial enlargement associated changes lung fields
left ventricular enlargement generally ischemic hypertensive heart disease progresses early cardiac decompensation often accompanied left atrial enlargement
generalized cardiac enlargement globular water bottle shape figure
indicates either pericardial effusion cardiomyopathy
two differentiated chest x ray except infrequently seen pericardial fat sign lateral view
occasionally pericardial fat seen thin lucent crescent soft tissue density myocardium effusion
seen lateral view behind sternum region right ventricle
echocardiography reliable way detect pericardial effusion
even small effusions interfere right heart filling chest x ray abnormal least ml fluid accumulated
constrictive pericarditis difficult diagnose chest x ray routinely associated either large small heart
additionally pericardial calcification diagnostic constriction
seen sequelae infection surgery e g pericardial window
general cardiac calcifications whether valvular pericardial myocardial coronary arterial best seen fluoroscopy
intrinsic motion heart improves visualization fluoroscopy obscures visualization plain films
pericardial calcification seen plain films best visualized lateral view circular crescentic calcification surrounding heart
may involve entire heart shadow small portion
valvular calcium also best seen lateral view
heart bisected along long axis lateral view aortic valve calcification lie anterior line mitral calcification posterior figure
coronary artery calcification seen anywhere along expected course arteries
left anterior descending circumflex arteries easiest see best seen lateral view
coronary artery calcification infinitely easier see fluoroscopy indicates significant coronary artery disease
evaluation pulmonary vasculature provides vital information cardiac function
interpretation changes sometimes made difficult noncardiac diseases also effect lung parenchyma pulmonary vessels
example emphysema destroying normal pulmonary architecture alter typical symmetric infiltrates pulmonary edema
basically three pathophysiologic states differentiated pulmonary venous hypertension postcapillary hypertension notable congestive heart failure passive increase pulmonary pressure valveless system pulmonary arterial hypertension precapillary hypertension end product many disease states markedly different pathophysiologies shunting due congenital heart diseases
interpreting presence pulmonary venous hypertension postcapillary hypertension involves assessing peripheral vessels within lung fields central hilar vessels including pulmonary arteries veins also azygous vein superior vena cava
normal peripheral vessels exhibit orderly branching pattern progressive decrease size
erect film lower lobe vessels larger e wider diameter upper lobe vessels
lower lobe vessels larger bases since contain greater blood flow hydrostatic pressure approximately cm ho compared cm ho apices
early left sided failure greater flow upper lobes
called cephalization blood flow
normally upper lobe vessels smaller caliber lower lobe counterparts
cephalization upper lobe vessels become size larger lower lobe vessels
causes cephalization emphysema supine patient
latter gravity dependent phenomenon makes interpretation cephalization portable film difficult
key compare portable films erect pa film
another early sign pulmonary venous hypertension engorgement central veins azygous vein superior vena cava
azygous vein located proximal convex curve right upper lobe bronchus
superior vena cava faint vertical shadow right trachea
always visible normal patient reliably dilate become visible early cardiac failure
early changes cephalization central venous enlargement may occur auscultatory changes present
particularly useful acute myocardial infarction pulmonary edema may yet clinically evident
pressure increases pulmonary venous hypertension engorged veins leak fluid across capillary membranes first interstitium lung finally increasing pressure alveoli
first phase interstitial edema many varied appearances
fluid fills interstitium causes nonspecific loss usually sharp vascular markings particularly hilum called perihilar haziness increased thickness bronchial walls seen end usually near hilum peribronchial cuffing appearance short thin cm long parallel lines seen right angles pleura laterally lung bases called kerley b lines figure
lines represent fluid interlobular septa
due heart failure indicate pulmonary venous pressures greater mm hg
wide variation clinical correlation stage severe dyspnea without clinical findings orthopnea dry cough
absence kerley b lines exclude high pressure
fluid interlobular septa portions lung fields called kerley c lines
similar variable appearance
kerley b lines often associated acute heart failure
occur however conditions mitral stenosis chronic failure uncommonly acute viral pneumonias
alveolar edema follows interstitial phase figure
alveolar infiltrates generally bilateral perihilar symmetric
patchy cause densely opacified lung fields
underlying lung diseases cause variable asymmetric appearances pulmonary edema
edema develop extensive bullous disease emphysema fibrosis
underlying honeycombing may give swiss cheese effect development pulmonary edema figure
hand pulmonary edema occur noncardiogenic basis causes drug intoxications drowning toxic inhalations hypersensitivity pneumonitis renal failure adult respiratory distress syndrome
cardiac contribution pulmonary edema determined placement swan ganz catheter
extensive bilateral symmetric alveolar infiltrates looking like pulmonary edema also seen severe fulminating pneumonias pneumococcal staphylococcal pneumocystis types
pulmonary hemorrhage alveolar proteinosis also mimic congestive heart failure
bilateral right sided pleural effusions occur stage acute heart failure may take long time resolve
uncommon heart returned normal size resolution edema pulmonary venous engorgement residual pleural effusion
rare purely left sided effusion heart failure
pulmonary arterial precapillary hypertension manifested enlargement central pulmonary arteries hilum without associated increase even decrease size number peripheral vessels figure
advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension hilar vessels may large mimic adenopathy
case fluoroscopy useful demonstrate pulmonary artery pulsations dance
longstanding hypertension right heart fails resulting right ventricular enlargement cor pulmonale
pleural effusions occur stage part generalized peripheral edema due right sided failure
pulmonary arterial hypertension occur primary idiopathic disease result chronic obstructive pulmonary disease interstitial fibrosis cause restrictive thoracic wall diseases severe kyphoscoliosis
occur acutely result severe hypoxemia acidosis hypoventilation
characteristic changes dilated central pulmonary arteries abrupt tapering second order peripheral vessels give quantitative information regarding degree resistance however presence calcification main pulmonary artery indicates long standing disease
pulmonary embolization classified pathophysiology belongs heading pulmonary arterial hypertension however radiographically rarely produces changes associated pulmonary artery hypertension
indeed half cases pulmonary emboli chest x ray normal another half nonspecific changes decreased lung volume elevation hemidiaphragm discoid platelike atelectasis small pleural effusions focal peripheral infiltrates representing areas hemorrhage infarct seen
appearance infiltrate sometimes suggestive peripheral pleural based wedge shaped apex pointing toward hilum hampton hump
rare sign localized oligemia abrupt vessel cutoff westermark sign
shunting refers changes pulmonary blood flow volume congenital cardiac defects
excluding causes focal intrapulmonary shunting pulmonary emboli pneumonia
estimate overall blood flow lungs suggest presence left right shunt increased flow right left shunt decreased flow
recognition normal abnormal matter experience rather specific criteria
despite subjectivity evaluation pulmonary blood volume important part cardiovascular interpretation chest x ray overlooked
example patient untreated atrial septal defect enlarged right heart often massively enlarged hyperemic lung fields
right heart increases size left heart particular left atrium remain normal size
size heart degree hyperemia depend size defect
defect cm greater result significant hemodynamic radiographic changes
common congenital lesions noted adult atrial septal defect congenital pulmonary stenosis coarctation aorta
atrial septal defect discussed
pulmonic stenosis adult frequently mild
radiographic changes include poststenolic dilatation pulmonary artery often predominantly left main pulmonary artery
degree dilatation correlate degree obstruction
longstanding artery may calcify
right ventricle hypertrophied generally dilated therefore normal chest x ray
generally blood flow also normal lung fields euvolemic
coarctation aorta may present adult previously unrecognized cause systemic hypertension sequelae treated disease include recurrence obstruction development aortic valve disease progressive atherosclerosis
coarctation generally beyond origin left subclavian artery
poststenotic dilatation indentation aortic knob
additional signs include left ventricular enlargement due hypertension development collateral vessels around obstruction
two effects
first dilated vessels may visible chest x ray mammary arteries serpiginous retrosternal densities lateral view left subclavian artery overlying apex lung pa view
second dilated intercostal arteries erode undersurface ribs producing rib notching
appear small bilateral unilateral well defined cortical defects sclerotic border undersurface fourth tenth ribs
normal young adult aortic knob seen pa view small portion arch lateral view
age hypertension atherosclerotic disease aorta elongates portion descending aorta may visible pa film right atrium descending aorta seen lateral view
atherosclerosis hypercalcemic states younger patient cause calcification wall
usually noted knob occur anywhere
aneurysms present localized dilation either pa lateral views maybe mistaken mediastinal mass
etiologies include atherosclerotic disease trauma less commonly today syphilitic aortitis
dissecting aneurysms whether atherosclerotic traumatic show widening mediastinum loss aortic knob shadow sometimes pleural fluid
classic appearance fluid apex left lung called apical cap however fluid accumulate anywhere including right pleural space
blood mediastinum push trachea esophagus right
latter recognized nasogastric tube displaced right expected course
another classic somewhat insensitive sign cm greater separation intimal calcification outer border aorta
dissections normal chest x ray
bone diseases severe kyphoscoliosis severe vertebral collapse multiple myeloma lead restrictive lung disease cardiac compromise
