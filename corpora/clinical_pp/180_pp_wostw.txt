dysuria discomfort associated urination
abnormally frequent urination e g every hour two termed urinary frequency
urgency abrupt strong often overwhelming need urinate
term dysuria used describe painful urination often signifies infection lower urinary tract
discomfort usually described patient burning stinging itching
pain occurring beginning urination suggests urethral site disease whereas pain voiding implies pathology within bladder prostate area
sometimes patient relate history pain suprapubic area
men pain urination often referred intensely glans penis regardless whether location disorder urethra bladder pain may persist voiding
specific questioning discharge penis undertaken especially younger men
inquiries character volume discharge important
gonococcal urethritis usually presents copious purulent discharge whereas nongonococcal urethritis commonly mucoid small quantity
older men specific questions asked associated hesitancy intermittency straining
ask patient standing closer toilet taking longer start previously
symptoms suggest obstruction common harbinger infection usually occurring either prostatic enlargement urethral stricture
women dysuria first question whether discomfort internal external addition urinary tract inflammation infection vaginal inflammation cause dysuria urine passes inflamed labia
sensation internal suprapubic urinary tract source likely questions associated fever chills back pain nausea vomiting prior urinary tract infections asked attempt differentiate upper lower urinary tract infection
sensation outside vaginal etiology suspected
questions vaginal discharge itching always asked
vaginitis urinary tract infection often coexist vaginal infections populations seen almost six times frequently urinary tract infections
remember women often spontaneously volunteer information vaginal discharge vaginal itching
help delineate etiology dysuria individual patient urinalysis pelvic examination often necessary
ascertain acuteness onset symptoms well whether associated hematuria suprapubic pain
coliform staphylococcal urinary tract infections typically acute onset less days often associated suprapubic pain hematuria chlamydial infections
women chlamydial infections likely use oral contraceptives less likely history urinary tract infection within preceding years
one also inquire sexual history chlamydial infections likely women new sex partner
addition history sex partner recent urethritis discharge might direct attention toward chlamydia gonorrhea tends less symptomatic early stages infection women
historic information immunosuppression diabetes mellitus sickle cell disease steroids etc childhood infections previous acute pyelonephritis prior relapses recurrences urinary tract infections especially greater three underlying urinary tract disease stones prior instrumentation congenital anomalies presence symptoms greater days define population women risk subclinical pyelonephritis
clinical entity upper tract infection without usual accompanying symptoms signs fever chills back pain nausea vomiting less amenable short courses therapy likely relapse
subclinical pyelonephritis occurs women typical primary care settings indigent women presenting dysuria
urinary frequency differentiated polyuria specifically relates passage abnormally large volume urine relatively short period time
frequency normal urination may vary considerably individual individual depending personality traits bladder capacity drinking habits
fact history frequency sometimes difficult obtain
changes pattern frequency history voiding night retiring however clues urinary pathology
ask volume voiding times since large bladder capacity may conceal increase urine production
frequency commonly accompanies dysuria associated urinary tract infections less commonly vaginitis
ask also periodicity symptoms day frequency without nocturia frequency lasting hours time suggests nervous tension psychiatric cause
urgency may occur without voiding frequently culminates incontinence
severe lower urinary tract inflammation desire urinate may constant milliliters urine eliminated voiding
urge incontinence must differentiated types incontinence especially stress incontinence
urgency also commonly accompanies dysuria associated urinary tract infections associated vaginitis
dysuria related inflammation lower urinary tract
although infection usually cause etiologies include crystalluria calculi bladder lower ureters tumors frank carcinoma carcinoma situ interstitial cystitis trauma related intercourse local irritation allergy foreign bodies instrumentation applied chemicals desiccation thinning urethral mucosa occurs menopause women
significant infections without symptoms occur ambulatory women men
conversely women men dysuria infection
certain subpopulations increased prevalence asymptomatic infections seen
risk factors include diabetes mellitus pregnancy bladder pathology cystoceles diverticula prostatic hypertrophy conditions contributing increased residual volume
pregnancy suprapubic discomfort difficulty urinating occur absence urinary tract infection
first trimester relate retroverted uterus late gestation due compression bladder fetal head
diagnosis urinary tract infection symptoms difficult late pregnancy urgency frequency suprapubic pressure occur normally
consequences urinary tract infections mother fetus careful attention symptoms frequent urinalysis imperative
average adult bladder holds ml urine
normal patterns urination may vary considerably adults generally void times daily retiring
average hour urinary output ml
urinary frequency may occur either increased urine volume decreased bladder capicity e less ml
increased urine volume result diuretic use diabetes mellitus osmotic diuresis diabetes insipidus compulsive water drinking loss renal concentrating ability
latter occurs early many types renal parenchymal disease including infection
also diuretic response termination supraventricular tachyarrhythmias bedrest setting edema
decreased bladder capacity result anxiety operative procedures obstruction resulting residual urine decreased functional capacity thickened inelastic fibrotic wall interstitial cystitis irradiation chronic infections tuberculosis schistosomiasis inflammatory conditions increase bladder sensitivity e g pressure intrinsic extrinsic masses calculi infections
spastic neurogenic bladders also cause decreased bladder capacity whereas hypotonic neurogenic bladders chronic large residual volumes greater ml mimic bladder outlet obstruction decreased functional capacity
low high urinary ph rarely cause frequency
psychiatric disturbances infrequently reflected symptoms urinary frequency
frequency common response emotional stress
urinary urgency implies inflammation often involving trigone posterior urethra
stretch receptors bladder posterior urethra subserve reflexes responsible urge void
urge urinate usually occurs bladder approaches maximum capacity
either inflammatory neuropathic processes lead increased sensitivity receptors
common clinical conditions resulting urgency include urinary tract infections trauma calculi bladder tumors especially carcinoma situ foreign bodies conditions lead decreased bladder capacity
inflammatory edema mucosa submucosa even muscularis mucosa results loss bladder elasticity subsequent pain even mild stretching bladder
urge incontinence common clinical settings previously mentioned including recent prostatectomy must distinguished forms incontinence overflow stress incontinence
symptoms dysuria frequency urgency tend occur together
share many etiologies
female population year seek medical attention syndrome lower urinary tract inflammation accounting greater million physician visits millions dollars supplementary costs tests medications
although may impossible determine symptoms alone whether individual patient prove urinary tract infection differentiate upper lower tract infection careful history provide important clues enable clinicians provide rational cost effective plan
patients present symptoms prove lower urinary tract infection specific treatment another condition outside urinary tract cure ameliorate symptoms
prominent examples include vaginitis inflammatory bowel disease
symptomatic asymptomatic bacteriuria rarely leads end stage renal disease entirely benign condition
early detection treatment urinary tract infections may relieve symptoms prevent pyelonephritis decrease subsequent morbidity mortality
especially pregnancy risks costs urinary tract infections high
men symptoms often imply structural lesion urinary tract radiographs surgical procedures often indicated
careful attention triad symptoms warranted therefore subtle symptomatology denote serious disease
