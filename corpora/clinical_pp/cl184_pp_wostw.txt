urinary flow defined terms size force patient stream
caliber force urinary stream vary greatly
normal urinary stream continuous least urination
hesitancy delay initiating urination
intermittency describes urinary stream continuous
incontinence involuntary loss urine
stress incontinence usually results pelvic relaxation damage urinary sphincter
urge incontinence usually secondary inflammatory changes urinary stretch receptors
overflow incontinence occurs minimal emptying distended bladder leaving high bladder volume short period next urination
total incontinence implies continual discharge urine
enuresis involuntary incontinence term commonly used nocturnal incontinence asleep
questions regarding size force urinary stream female patients rarely fruitful unless extreme outlet obstruction present
importance question male patients infancy adulthood overstated however quality history reflects tenacity experience clinician
normal caliber force urinary stream varies among individuals examiner attempt elicit history changes urinary stream rather specific caliber force
begin asking decrease size stream
pointedly ask patient infant parent questions easily related several reference points
example infant urinate across bed
could write name snow sidewalk
stand closer toilet toilet prevent going shoes floor
stream strong years ago
observe patient urinary stream
accurate documentation urinary flow may obtained timed voided specimens dynamics
hesitancy usually mentioned patient
ask wait awhile stream start
distinguished shy bladder patient experiences difficulty voiding presence nurse physician person
intermittency evaluated asking started urination pass continuous stream
eliminates questionably significant terminal dribbling experienced many normal men
two features notable one observes voiding male patient hesitancy intermittency straining often apparent initiating maintaining stream stream often slows stops takes breath
patients asked difficulty controlling urination loss urine inappropriate times
response positive detailed evaluation nature incontinence necessary
determine whether incontinence occurs without patient knowledge patient know going urinate unable get bathroom time incontinence noted indirectly clothes bed found wet
history stress incontinence elicited asking patient involuntary urination occurs coughing sneezing straining lifting heavy objects
urgency urge incontinence suggested patient states feels strong desire urinate suppress flow urine reaching toilet
ask bedwetting occurs night nocturnal incontinence enuresis occurs night daytime
ask urine leaks dribbles time total incontinence intermittent small amounts overflow incontinence
factors controlling caliber urinary stream force urinary flow primarily mechanical
secondarily influenced volitional control however
force pressure flow initially generated bladder modification patient use accessory abdominal muscles
caliber force flow also influenced caliber bladder outlet
bladder outlet refers bladder neck posterior anterior urethra urethral meatus
posterior urethral obstructions produce stream little force
distal urethral obstructions usually strictures may produce stream markedly reduced caliber normal force
distal obstructions stream may split
difficulty initiating maintaining voiding found lower urinary obstruction ineffective bladder contractility
alterations flow characteristics urinary stream usually caused obstruction
leads diminution caliber flow
infants children obstruction may congenital posterior urethral valves congenital bladder neck contracture urethral meatal stenosis phimosis
adults obstructions commonly secondary urethral stricture disease prostatic hyperplasia carcinoma prostate
females urethral diverticula cystoceles may lead diminution flow
males females flow pattern urinary stream may influenced bladder neoplasms urethral diverticula neuropathic changes bladder
forms incontinence may secondary neuropathic disturbances bladder
thorough investigation particular form carried
stress incontinence classically occurs multigravida elderly female pelvic relaxation cystocele urethrocele
findings confirmed valsalva maneuver pelvic examination
stress incontinence may also occur patients previous trauma surgical procedures near bladder neck urinary sphincters thereby weakening control retention urine
previously stated urge incontinence usually seen conjunction inflammatory processes bladder posterior urethra
overflow incontinence may occur neuropathic disturbances commonly associated bladder outlet obstruction patient urinary retention frequently voids small amounts urine
total true incontinence may occur patients neuropathic disturbance bladder urinary sphincters bypassed flow urine
examples latter would include patients vesicovaginal urethrovaginal fistulas patients ectopic ureters empty vagina urethra point distal urinary sphincters
enuresis may symptom outflow obstruction often difficult adult distinguish overflow incontinence
classic enuresis occurs children present birth
exact dynamics enuresis unknown rarely investigation need undertaken patients age
beyond age total control urination present children
thorough neurologic examinations urinary tract x rays obtained adult patients enuresis high prevalence associated genitourinary pathology
