several techniques determination chloride available including autoanalyzer colorimetric techniquesma aca methods coulometric method mercurimetric method chloride specific ion electrodes
autoanalyzer method chloride ions displace thiocyanate mercuric thiocyanate
free thiocyanate reacts ferric ions form colored complex ferric thiocyanate measured photometrically
technique specific chloride anion
halogens including bromide sulfhydryl ions react mercuric thiocyanate
bromide greater affinity mercuric ion chloride equimolar quantities bromide yield fescn equimolar quantities chloride
therefore small amount bromide result reaction read marked elevation serum chloride determination
cotlove coulometric chloride titrator another technique measures total chloride concentration
method passage constant direct current silver electrodes produces silver ions
free silver ions react chloride forming silver chloride
chloride combines ag free silver ions accumulate causing increase current across electrodes indicating end point reaction

part chloride filtered initial portion nephron glomerulus reabsorbed result active passive transport processes along tubules comprising nephron
ability nephrons reabsorb chloride maintains serum ecf chloride concentration within narrow range figure
majority filtered chloride reabsorbed sodium transport first portion tubule proximal tubule
reabsorption chloride segment occurs two phases
initial portion proximal tubule sodium entry cell linked active co transport organic solutes na glucose na amino acids na phosphate na organic anions active secretion h tubule cells thus reabsorption hco
active processes raise intraluminal chloride concentration thus producing later segments proximal tubule passive movement chloride along favorable concentration electrochemical gradient see figure
straight portion proximal tubule pars recta chloride reabsorption continues result passive diffusion favorable electrochemical gradient
descending limb loop henle next portion nephron relatively impermeable nacl na cl transport occurs
next segment thick ascending limb loop henle chloride actively transported specific carrier mediated process na k follows passively maintain electroneutrality
recent data suggest model two cl ions transported na k
evidence also suggests chloride transport increased segment generation cyclic adenosine monophosphate antidiuretic hormone
distal convoluted tubule proximal tubule chloride transport may passive active
postulated proven chloride transport coupled energy provided passive influx sodium cell

summary active passive transport processes important reabsorption chloride nephrons kidney
proximal tubule appears responsible reabsorbing majority filtered chloride ascending loop henle reabsorbs another significant amount
distal tubule collecting duct although reabsorbing smaller quantity chloride may also play important role balance
quantity chloride excreted urine e reabsorbed tubules nephron constant varies day day depending whether kidneys trying conserve eliminate chloride
ability kidneys vary daily chloride excretion keeps total body chloride values relatively constant maintains serum chloride concentrations within narrow range despite marked daily variations chloride intake
