vertigo abnormal sensation motion
occur absence motion motion sensed inaccurately
spinning vertigo usually inner ear origin
disequilibrium sensation impending fall need obtain external assistance proper locomotion
sometimes described feeling improper tilt floor sense floating
sensation originate inner ear motion sensors central nervous system
positional vertigo sensation spinning occurs patient head moved new position respect gravity
vertigo disequilibrium common symptoms primary care practice
since symptoms associated serious disease important evaluate properly
disorder interferes sensory function vision balance proprioception affects oculomotor control system result disequilibrium vertigo table
history centers establishing underlying disease sensory systems central mechanisms mediate responses sensory systems
objectives history obtain clear description symptoms associated symptoms gather information help locate lesion
need determine whether lesion central peripheral side lesion
ask patient describe major symptom onset duration severity symptoms occur time
tinnitus ear pressure hearing loss suggests inner ear location disorder also points involved ear
nausea vomiting frequently accompany inner ear disorders loss vision slurred speech loss consciousness suggests central nervous system cerebrovascular disorders
slowing pulse sometimes noted vertigo inner ear origin rapid irregular heartbeat suggests cardiac arrhythmia underlying problem
intermittent vertigo frequency time interval duration noted
specifically ask whether change head position brings changes symptoms
positional vertigo extremely common cases inner ear origin
history ear pain drainage ear trauma important determine disease originating ear
past history ear infections head trauma ototoxic medications must elicited
patients may told medication ototoxic
therefore also ask hospitalizations infectious illnesses renal heart disease common reasons administration ototoxic antibiotics diuretics
family history vertigo hearing loss suggests hereditary degenerative processes inner ear
general health problems diabetes mellitus heart disease atherosclerosis neurologic disorders cause vertigo
neurologic disorders tend cause constant vertigo disequilibrium usually symptoms neurologic dysfunction associated vertigo
many medications used treat seizures depression anxiety pain affect vestibular system central nervous system
complete medication history essential needs include counter illegal drugs produce vertigo disequilibrium
head motion sensed vestibular labyrinth vision
turning movements head sensed semicircular canals
linear head movements center gravity sensed utricle saccule
muscle joint receptors neck spine limbs sense body position body head motion
information labyrinth transmitted superior inferior vestibular nerve internal auditory canal vestibular nuclei medullary pontine junction
secondary neurons connect neurons third fourth sixth cranial nerve nuclei via medial longitudinal fasciculus reticular formation
rostral connections go frontal cortex sense rotation
descending fibers go spinal column via medial longitudinal fascicules lateral vestibulospinal tracts
visual system sends information retina via optic nerves optic chiasm optic radiations occipital cortex
frontal parietal cortex involved pursuit saccade eye movements necessary targeting visual system head movements movements environment
cortical eyefields project via superior colliculus parapontine reticular formation oculomotor nuclei initiate eye movements
visual vestibular information integrated several levels central nervous system particularly brainstem cerebellum
acute attack vertigo due sudden change labyrinthine function
anatomically disorder peripheral labyrinth viral labyrinthitis temporal bone fracture perilymph fistula ménière disease bacterial labyrinthitis occlusion labyrinthine blood supply thrombus infrequently cerebellopontine angle tumor
also due damage vestibular nuclei brain stem
ménière disease usually results recurrent attacks vertigo unilateral hearing loss tinnitus feeling fullness one ear
feeling chronic disequilibrium caused bilateral loss labyrinthine function
due degenerative disorders ototoxic drugs bilateral labyrinthitis previous meningitis head injury
also seen central nervous system degenerative disorders multiple sclerosis drug abuse exceeding therapeutic levels prescribed drugs
almost medication used control epilepsy anxiety depression
addition antihistamines atropine scopalomine higher doses cause disequilibrium
central nervous system disease usually historical physical evidence involvement sensory motor connecting systems
