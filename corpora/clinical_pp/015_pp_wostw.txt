blood pressure pressure measured millimeters mercury within major arterial system body
conventionally separated systolic diastolic determinations
systolic pressure maximum blood pressure contraction ventricles diastolic pressure minimum pressure recorded prior next contraction
blood pressure usually written systolic pressure diastolic pressure e g mm hg
minimum acceptable blood pressure determined adequate perfusion vital organs without symptoms hypotension
usually mm hg systolic mm hg diastolic although great variation patients
report joint national committee detection evaluation treatment high blood pressure gives recommended scheme categorizing arterial pressure individuals age years
scheme summarized table
accurate measurement arterial blood pressure obtained direct methods involve sophisticated expensive equipment well cannulation artery
although methods necessary settings sphygmomanometric measurements much easier safer accurate enough clinical situations
standard blood pressure cuff must proper size minimize errors blood pressure determinations
width bladder ideally circumference limb tested
standard cuffs bladder length twice width
ensures length recommended limb circumference
cuffs small give results erroneously high cuffs large give results erroneously low
patient comfortably seated deflated cuff applied bladder centered brachial artery
high enough arm allow stethoscope placed antecubital fossa without touching cuff
pressure rapidly increased least mm hg higher eliminates palpable radial pulse
stethoscope place brachial artery antecubital fossa cuff slowly deflated rate mm hg per second
pressure declines korotkoff sounds noted
sounds table
low pitched sometimes easily auscultated bell stethoscope
palpating loss radial pulse essential patients particularly hypertension may auscultatory gap
complete loss korotkoff sounds pressures higher true diastolic
careful auscultation patients reveal return sounds allowing accurate pressure determinations figure
systolic blood pressure best estimated using phase korotkoff sounds e first sounds auscultated
phase v korotkoff sounds e loss sounds estimates diastolic pressures
usually phase iv phase v sounds occur near
however widely separated blood pressure may written signify e g
circumstances phase iv sounds accurately predict diastolic pressures
considerable controversy exists concerning prediction diastolic blood pressure using korotkoff sounds
kirkendall et al
addresses controversies recommends phase v sounds adults phase iv children
systolic pressure normally varies respirations
inspiration negative intrathoracic pressure causes pooling blood expanding pulmonary vessels delay flow left ventricle
thus systolic pressure falls cardiac output falls momentarily
following procedure checks paradoxical pulse
normal respirations pressure noted korotkoff sounds first heard
commonly first sounds audible expiration
cuff pressure slowly lowered korotkoff sounds heard continually
difference two pressures exceeds mm hg pulsus paradoxus exists
paradoxical pulse occurs commonly clinical situations involving large negative intrathoracic pressures like heavy breathing asthma emphysema
pulsus paradoxus also occurs pericardial tamponade mechanisms complex well understood
blood pressure usually taken patient seated
additional information may gained checking patient lying standing positions
supine blood pressure compared obtained patient standing sufficient time allow pulse stabilize
normally systolic blood pressure drop mm hg diastolic pressure remain unchanged rise slightly
significant orthostatic changes blood pressure may indicate dehydration adverse drug reaction
correlated inadequate rise pulse may indicate autonomic nervous system dysfunction
patients blood pressure checked left right arm least detect anatomical abnormalities
pressure differences greater mm hg may indicate obstruction flow one brachial arteries occurs coarctation aorta
overall blood pressure measured brachial artery maintained cardiac output total peripheral resistance tpr flow
mean arterial pressure map calculated formula
dbp sbp diastolic systolic blood pressure respectively
mean arterial pressure useful concept used calculate overall blood flow thus delivery nutrients various organs

tpr resistance flow dynes · sec · cm clinically represents nlpr conversion factor appears formula simply allow use conventional units

example typical hypertensive cardiac output normal elevated blood pressure thought occur direct result increased tpr
tpr maintained resistance vessels small precapillary muscular arterioles regulate rate diastolic runoff arterial tree
resistance vessels regulate blood flow changes vascular tone adjust radius r vessel
since radius appears formula fourth power e tpr nlpr small adjustments cause significant changes tpr
example bp tpr
example representative septic shock
lax vasomotor tone causes low tpr blood pressure maintained substantial rise cardiac output
cardiac output calculated multiplying heart rate stroke volume
intrinsic cardiac disease stroke volume may decreased cardiac output maintained compensatory rise heart rate
given tpr blood pressure maintained unless relative bradycardia fall stroke volume
systole volume blood ejected left ventricle must enter aorta major arterial branches
distensibility arteries compensates volume stores energy order perfuse capillary beds diastole
example aorta stiff atherosclerotic disease left ventricle generates higher pressure eject given quantity blood systolic pressure higher
heartbeat minor adjustments factors intricately controlled provide perfusion organs
baroreceptors aorta carotid body stretched blood pressure send feedback information autonomic nervous system centers brainstem
autonomic outflow controls heart rate vascular tone contractile state myocardium adjust blood pressure accordingly
ideal blood pressure adequately perfuses various organ systems without causing damage
organ adequately perfused suffer ischemic damage andor unable perform adequately
poor brain blood flow cause declining mental status lethargy somnolence even coma
poor renal perfusion may cause renal failure wide ranging metabolic consequences
contrast blood pressures high may cause end organ damage equally disastrous consequences
heart attack stroke hypertensive renal failure retinopathy familiar hypertensive population
earliest clinical manifestation low blood pressure may fatigue shortness breath exertion
increased oxygen nutrient demand exercising muscles met perfusion pressure inadequate
declines blood pressure may lead lightheadedness particularly assuming upright posture
urine output helpful indicator vital organ perfusion normal kidneys drop mlhr intrarenal blood pressure satisfactory
common causes low blood pressure dehydration decreased cardiac output
dehydration manifested postural blood pressure drops reflex tachycardia treated appropriate volume expansion
may blood products case trauma significant bleeding salt water case prolonged exposure hot environment
poor cardiac output may result hypotension thorough examination cardiac contractility heart rate dictate appropriate therapy
inadequate contractility may improved positive inotropic agents digoxin
abnormal heart rates may require antiarrhythmic agents rapid vagolytic agents atropine slow
occasionally pacemaker required maintain satisfactory heart rate blood pressure
clinical significance hypertension shown numerous studies
prolonged exposure elevated pressure associated increased incidence cardiovascular disease e g stroke dissecting aneurysm heart attack renal failure retinopathy
moreover evidence morbidity mortality reduced proper treatment hypertension
perhaps million people united states hypertension proper understanding disorder essential
diagnosis hypertension made patients require lifelong therapy
spontaneous variations blood pressure caused emotional dietary exertional factors make problem difficult
diagnosis based inaccurate blood pressure determination single reading lifetime drug expense exposure potential side effects may endured needlessly
therefore except severe hypertension least three readings assessed according table
therapy initiated
therapeutic intervention trials used sitting pressure phase diastolic recordings
clinical judgments based studies criteria determining blood pressure
although known diastolic hypertension regard morbidity mortality effects treatment isolated systolic hypertension equally important recently recognized significant clinical problem
isolated systolic hypertension defined table uncommon elderly
