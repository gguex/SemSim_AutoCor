patients abnormalities thyroid gland function structure come medical attention several reasons
present symptoms attributable physiologic effects increased decreased plasma concentrations thyroid hormone hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism respectively
may also present symptoms related localized generalized enlargement gland diffuse goiter multinodular goiter single thyroid nodule
changes may result functional abnormalities neoplasia benign malignant
following symptoms typical problems may eventually diagnosed specific thyroid diseases syndromes
diagnoses related hyperthyroidism thyrotoxicosis complaints may include weight loss anxiety nervousness increased sweating tremulousness diarrhea palpitations muscular weakness heat intolerance history treatment overactive thyroid
diagnoses related hypothyroidism typical problems include fatigue weight gain depression lethargy dry skin cold intolerance voice change change menses muscle cramps treatment thyroid condition
thyroid enlargement goiter may present context hyper hypothyroidism
may also occur patient normal thyroid hormone production euthyroid patient
typical complaints related thyroid enlargement include generalized neck swelling diffuse goiter neck mass uninodular multinodular goiter dysphagia neck pain hoarseness
finally patients may referred complaints abnormal thyroid function tests lead search symptoms signs thyroid dysfunction

understanding thyroid disease interpretation thyroid function tests requires understanding hypothalamic pituitary thyroid feedback control see figure
also demands appreciation thyroid hormone transport response cells non protein bound thyroid hormone
hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone trh modulates release pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone tsh
tsh interacts specific receptors thyroid follicular cells stimulate thyroid hormone production approximately thyroxine triiodothyronine
transported blood bound serum proteins
remainder production comes conversion peripheral tissues
active form thyroid hormone
non protein bound thyroid hormones representing minor fraction total circulating thyroid hormones enter peripheral cells interact specific nuclear binding protein
interaction leads induction many enzymes finally express effect thyroid hormones
circulating levels sensed pituitary gland perhaps hypothalamus control secretion tsh thereby maintain blood levels thyroid hormones within normal limits
disturbances many aspects complex system present physician clinical laboratory findings hyper hypothyroidism goiter apparent abnormalities thyroid function testing without definite clinical correlates
often discordance clinical findings arid laboratory testing makes diagnosis thyroid disorders challenging stimulating
noniatrogenic causes thyroid dysfunction include inflammation acute subacute thyroiditis autoimmune disease hashimoto thyroiditis graves disease inherited metabolic defects mono di iodotyrosine deiodinase deficiency malignancy follicular papillary anaplastic parafollicular c cell nutritional deficiencies iodine protein deficiency
thyroid problems may also directly result medical surgical therapies thyroid gland indirectly treatment nonthyroid conditions
examples include hypothyroidism radioactive iodine surgery graves disease thyroid cancer x ray therapy head neck
hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism reported treatment arrhythmias amiodarone contains iodine
although enlargement thyroid gland may suggest thyroid disease physiologic temporary enlargement thyroid gland associated pregnancy adolescence normal
occasionally confused abnormal enlargement must considered differential diagnosis goiter
thyrotoxic patient see table
suffers signs symptoms attributable metabolic effects excessive thyroid hormone many appear related increased activity sympathetic nervous system
must differentiated non thyroid related causes actual apparent hypermetabolism sympathetic overactivity pheochromocytoma cocaine abuse nonspecific anxiety
use beta sympathomimetic blocking drugs treating thyrotoxicosis relieves many symptoms attributable sympathetic nervous system without decreasing least acutely increased consumption oxygen characteristic hypermetabolic state
contrast hyperthyroidism hypothyroid patient signs symptoms attributable decreased circulating concentrations thyroid hormone see table
hypothyroid individuals demonstrate decreased oxygen consumption overall impression reduced sympathetic activity
weight gain psychomotor retardation related decreased metabolic rate due decreased thyroid hormone
addition hypothyroidism results decreased clearance metabolic products cholesterol triglyceride enzymes creatine phosphokinase cpk
therefore serum concentrations substances increased
furthermore metabolic clearance medications decreased increased risk toxicity commonly used medications sedatives digitalis preparations
genetic predisposition thyroid disease apparent autoimmune thyroid disorders
specific enzyme deficiencies related concentrating iodine synthesizing thyroid hormone reclaiming iodotyrosine iodine clearly inherited
certain forms thyroid cancer parafollicular may also genetic component
thus family history thyroid disease goiter may direct attention subtle overlooked thyroid problem
conversely goiter requires data gathered concerning possible family history thyroid abnormalities
hypothyroidism caused pituitary hypothalamic dysfunction rather primary thyroid disease symptoms findings endocrine end organ dysfunction usually present
pituitary disease present clinical manifestations include hypogonadism amenorrhea decreased libido impotence growth hormone deficiency short stature children postpartum agalactia hypoadrenalism nausea vomiting diarrhea hyponatremia decreased tolerance medical stress
hypothalamic abnormalities may also cause hypothyroidism interfering trh secretion cause many features seen pituitary failure
hypothalamic dysfunction also primary hypothyroidism hyperprolactinemia may occur association hypogonadism
hypothalamic disease absence pituitary lactotroph inhibiting factor dopamine leads unregulated prolactin secretion hyperprolactinemia
primary hypothyroidism increased trh secretion sensitivity causes pituitary lactotrophs secrete large amounts prolactin
marked enlargement pituitary gland may occur primary hypothyroidism may simulate prolactinoma
however hyperprolactinemia pituitary enlargement resolve reversal hypothyroidism supplying adequate replacement thyroid hormone
thyroid problems also include interpretation abnormal thyroid function tests either obtained confirm presence thyroid disease screening procedures detect thyroid dysfunction
difficulties evaluating tests related marked elevations reduction thyroxine binding serum proteins changes thyroxine production clearance phenytoin effect response acute chronic illness unusual inherited states resistance effects thyroid hormone
tiny fraction total serum concentrations thyroxine triiodothyronine circulate free blood
cellular response thyroid hormone determined non protein bound fraction
majority bound three plasma proteins thyroxine binding globulin tbg thyroxine binding prealbumin tbpa albumin
primarily bound thyroxine binding globulin albumin tiny amount bound tbpa
thyroid function tests measure total amount circulating thyroid hormone affected physiologic events alter amount binding proteins
thus somewhat increased decreased total serum concentrations may associated normal amounts free thyroid hormones
hypothalamic pituitary axis intact low circulating concentrations free associated increases pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone tsh increased responsiveness pituitary gland exogenously administered thyrotropin releasing hormone trh
thus primary hypothyroidism often results generalized thyroid enlargement
exception however
autoimmune thyroiditis blocking antibodies tsh receptors thyroid cells may prevent tsh stimulation thyroid atrophy may occur even primary hypothyroidism
conversely concentrations free increased tsh decreased response trh blunted
indirect measures free non protein bound thyroxine free thyroxine index fti direct measures free equilibrium dialysis used assess true elevations reductions free thyroxine
rare instances however even elevated free values may associated hyperthyroidism increasing numbers patients identified peripheral resistance thyroid hormone
patients may asymptomatic require elevations order maintain normal metabolic function
subgroup patients peripheral resistance thyroid hormone identified astute clinicians refused accept diagnosis thyrotoxicosis basis abnormally elevated concentrations free patients goiter symptoms hyperthyroidism
token patients appear euthyroid low total values may congenital deficiency tbg normal free hormone concentrations
short thyroid function tests obtained certainly interpreted definitive fashion without correlating symptoms signs manifested patient
concentrations physiologically active also depend nutritional status general health
active form thyroid hormone triiodothyronine may replaced increased amounts reverse alternate form little biologic activity
medications corticosteroids clinical states starvation chronic illness euthyroid sick syndrome may increase inactive form thyroid hormone associated reductions see table
enormous range clinical tests available clinician confirm presence hyper hypothyroidism
commonly used measures total circulating thyroid hormone particularly radioimmunoassay ria screening thyroid dysfunction
total ria reverse also available
concentrations free inferred total measurements thyroxine binding resin uptake used calculate free thyroxine index proportional free
similar index calculated free
pituitary tsh conjunction total provides basis differentiating primary hypothyroidism thyroid gland failure secondary hypothyroidism hypothalamic pituitary failure causing hypothyroidism
trh stimulation tests useful assessing patients autonomous thyroid hyperfunction example deciding graves disease remission euthyroid graves disease present patients adequate suppressive dose thyroid hormone thyroid ablation cancer
present tsh ria supplanted ultrasensitive tsh radioimmunometric assay irma
tsh ria adequate tool monitoring elevated concentrations tsh
relatively insensitive test however monitoring low concentrations tsh seen thyrotoxicosis clue causes except rare situation tsh secreting pituitary adenoma
thus tsh irma replaces trh stimulation test suppression test diagnosing thyrotoxicosis
thyroid function also assessed capacity thyroid tissue take incorporate iodide similar compounds radioiodine scan uptake technetium pertechnetate scan
distribution scanning material also helps assess general localized thyroid malfunction
ultrasound computed tomographic ct scanning recently magnetic resonance imaging mri assist determining nature thyroid nodules
needle aspiration utilized define nature nodules assist preoperative diagnosis malignancy
tests antithyroglobulin antimicrosomal antibodies assist identification patients autoimmune thyroiditis
antibodies tsh receptors clinically available tsh like thyroid stimulating antibodies tsi thyroid blocking immunoglobulins diagnose graves disease atrophic hypothyroidism
thyroid related medical problems exceedingly common
symptoms hyper hypothyroidism nonspecific often attributed medical psychiatric illness
furthermore signs symptoms may develop long period time friends family even personal physicians adapt changes perceive abnormalities
conditions tend prevent patient functioning normally work family environment thus eventually come medical attention
conditions difficult diagnose elderly
diagnosis thyroid disease great benefit patient
hyper hypothyroidism extremely disabling
graves disease may progress thyroid storm
blindness may occur associated ophthalmopathy
profound weakness associated wasting hypermetabolic state
hypokalemic periodic paralysis mostly orientals also groups may associated profound periodic muscle weakness
treated using beta blockers reversing hyperthyroid state
graves disease complicating pregnancy associated increased fetal wastage
contrast hypothyroidism may associated central respiratory failure
pericardial effusion causing pericardial tamponade may occur
hypothyroidism may unrecognized cause infertility hypertension
may cause profound depression
probably accelerates progression atherosclerosis hypercholesterolemia associated
autoimmune thyroiditis associated greater frequency autoimmune diseases type diabetes mellitus
although thyroid diseases chronic often debilitating treatable
host medications available control signs symptoms hyperthyroidism controlling sympathetic stimulatory effects thyroid hormone beta sympatholytic drugs propranolol controlling uptake synthesis thyroid hormone propylthiouracil methimazole iodide lithium decreasing release iodide decreasing conversion peripheral tissues propylthiouracil propranolol glucocorticoids
radioiodide used treat hyperthyroidism disseminated thyroid cancer
surgery also effective treating conditions although used less frequently thyrotoxicosis availability effective drugs radioiodide
hypothyroidism thyroid replacement therapy thyroid hormone effective relatively inexpensive
symptoms related thyroid dysfunction nonspecific sensitive
thus weight gain constipation cold intolerance frequently found hypothyroidism patients complaining obesity constipation cold intolerance hypothyroid
nonetheless additional complaint renders diagnosis likely particularly physical findings suggestive hypothyroidism also present
confirmatory evidence comes laboratory demonstrating example low total elevated tsh indicating primary thyroid failure
similarly symptoms related hyperthyroidism individually sensitive however aggregate specific
hvperthyroidism may relatively easy diagnose symptomatic patient characteristic physical features graves disease diffuse toxic goiter include prominent exophthalmos protruding eyes blepharospasm stare prominent diffuse goiter tremor weight loss rapid pulse hyperdynamic circulation wide pulse pressure rapidly rising pulse wave prominent apical pulse hyperreflexia
one less likely think hyperthyroidism without clear cut graves disease particularly elderly pregnant patients forms thyrotoxicosis
hyperthyroidism elderly may manifested weight loss refractory cardiac arrhythmias chronic diarrhea
patients thyrotoxicosis pregnancy may missed many normal women complain heat intolerance fatigue irritability tachycardia
addition mild diffuse thyroid enlargement normally found pregnancy
conversely thyrotoxicosis may still mistakenly diagnosed pregnancy findings serum thyroxine elevated increase circulating thyroxine binding globulin tbg thought confirm thyrotoxicosis
one several forms euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia see table
assessment free thyroxine free fti must made establish diagnosis pregnancy
nevertheless thyrotoxicosis common pregnancy increases risk adverse outcome mother fetus
increased risk thyroid storm mother increased fetal wastage increased frequency babies small gestational age
thyrotoxicosis probably related thyroiditis condition usually transient seen increasing frequency pregnant patient
rare form thyrotoxicosis found pregnancy associated hydatidiform mole choriocarcinoma
instance human chorionic gonadotropin weak tsh properties produced enormous amounts able cause thyroid enlargement increased production thyroid hormone leading thyrotoxicosis
diagnosed recognizing excessively rapid uterine growth presumably pregnant patient demonstrating lack fetal parts ultrasound examination
thyrotoxicosis patients cured evacuation tumor
causes thyrotoxicosis include single multiple autonomous nodules cases palpable abuse thyroid hormone neurotic patients inappropriate dosages thyroid hormone administered thyroid replacement suppression
rare causes thyrotoxicosis pituitary adenomas secreting tsh autonomous hypersecreting thyroid tissue ovary struma ovarii widespread thyroid hormone secreting follicular carcinoma
reliance screening populations hyperthyroidism using thyroid function tests part health maintenance surveys relatively expensive inefficient
asymptomatic euthyroid patients elevated thyroxine binding pre albumin tbpa abnormal thyroxine binding albumin patients increased peripheral resistance thyroid hormone screening tests may lead unnecessary treatment hyperthyroidism
screening hypothyroidism may worthwhile certain populations
good argument screening newborns hypothyroidism devastating effects condition central nervous system
prevented early thyroid hormone replacement
screening also advocated elderly high frequency hypothyroidism particularly elderly women
nevertheless screening thyroid function reveal many individuals particularly chronic illness euthyroid sick apparent hypothyroidism low total measurements
persons treatment underlying condition key rational therapy
summary symptoms related hyper hypothyroidism correlated physical findings
clinical diagnoses supported appropriate laboratory testing thyroid function
discordances clinical findings laboratory testing require explanation complete diagnoses require inconsistencies resolved
