pelvic examination performed collect information lower abdomen external genitalia vagina cervix including cervical cytology uterus adnexa anus rectum
rapport made patient antecedent pelvic examination via anamnesis general medical examination
room clean comfortable temperature
physician likewise clean neatly clad
running operating room office bloody scrub suit reserved dire emergencies
patient placed examining table shod feet stirrups comfort ascertained
always instruct patient void examination done
physician assure patient pelvic examination done gently possible
examination usually begins inspection gentle palpation lower abdomen masses tenderness distention hernias incisions
note also made pubic hair distribution well amount distribution facial axillary hair
left hand used examining vagina since evaluation left side pelvis easier left hand vagina
left side pelvis ordinarily difficult evaluate sigmoid colon usually located left
also strongest hand patient lower abdomen people strongest hand right hand
excellent light shining examiner shoulder adequate illumination external genitalia
index middle fingers gloved left hand external genitalia inspected palpated
lesion warty growth mass ulcer anything else must examined carefully
size clitoris development labia minora majora noted
skin posterior vaginal fourchette anus perineal body inspected
inspection anus perianal area also done
area bartholin glands lower portion labia may palpated thumb index fingers left hand placing index finger inside vaginal introitus
ordinarily normal bartholin glands felt tender
also one usually see orifice bartholin gland duct
fingers inserted along anterior vaginal wall base bladder firm pressure directed toward symphysis fingers brought urethra
urethra stripped examiner watch appearance pus external urethral meatus
note tenderness induration paraurethral tissue glands
two fingers gently press downward posterior perineum ask patient strain cough
part examination allow determination relaxation support vaginal introitus vaginal walls uterus
presence urethrocele cystocele rectocele enterocele uterine descensus loss urine bladder urethra may detected
ordinarily cervix visible patient strains
two fingers vagina one may also palpate medial border levator muscle
muscles usually tender palpated
impression strength competence muscles may obtained asking patient squeeze tightly around examiner finger vagina
patient may helped identify muscles reminded muscles used stop flow urine midstream
bivalve speculum inserted
comfortably warm moistened water
inserted two fingers depressing posterior perineum along posterior vaginal wall
anterior vaginal wall sensitive
therefore tip speculum directed away anterior vaginal wall
bivalve speculum opened cervix may completely visualized
important use speculum proper size
thin narrow speculum may used young girls older women
adult parous women examined satisfactorily medium size graves speculum
occasionally necessary use large speculum
cervical cytology smear taken
several techniques obtaining specimens cytologic examination see chapter pap test
wise use technique advised cytologist read smear
cervical cultures taken chlamydia neisseria patients high risk groups
patients advised douche intercourse least days cytology smear made
inspect cervix carefully
look erosion eversion cysts polyps lacerations ulcerations cervical enlargement bleeding menstrual discharge
special diagnostic procedures schiller iodine stain cervical biopsy endocervical scrape colposcopy cervical uterine sounding may necessary
direction cervix points may give clue position uterine corpus
example cervix points anteriorly toward bladder body uterus usually found retroverted cul de sac
remove speculum slowly completely inspect vaginal walls
inspect evidence vaginitis vaginal discharge foreign bodies lesions
bimanual examination done next
lubricate fingers examining hand
cervix felt two fingers left hand vagina
note location consistency cervix
especially soft cervix
pregnancy especially hard cervix
cancer noted
place right hand patient lower abdomen immediately symphysis
uterus usually palpated pear shaped organ midline anterior
may lifted vaginal fingers greater ease palpation
ordinarily firm smooth movable nontender
notations made abnormality size shape symmetry consistency mobility
adnexal region surrounds uterus contains fallopian tubes ovaries rectosigmoid small intestine bladder ureters vessels nerves
thin relaxed patient usually possible palpate normal ovaries adnexal region lateral posterior uterus
patients may difficult feel normal ovaries
examine adnexal region masses tenderness
mass felt carefully note size location consistency contour mobility associated tenderness
also note presence induration adnexa
using different glove repeat bimanual examination middle finger left hand placed rectum
extremely important examination done gently
tip middle finger well lubricated placed anal orifice
ask patient strain
strains gentle pressure needed insert middle finger full length
patient straining anal sphincter dilated insertion finger cause less discomfort
pelvic examination complete unless bimanual examination done finger rectum
part examination allows better examination pelvis rectal finger reach beyond posterior vaginal fornix therefore palpate uterosacral ligaments paracervical tissue broad ligaments ovaries pelvic side walls
finger withdrawn entire circumference rectum felt
feces adherent glove covering rectal finger inspected evidence mucus fresh old blood
bimanual examination done palpation bladder may also carried
mass abnormal induration tenderness findings noted
impression bimanual examination adequate constipated stool rectum lower colon patient instructed take enema return another examination
occasionally examination vagina patient knee chest position necessary
vagina naturally distended air position
vaginal walls inspected better
pelvic examination patient standing often necessary may done complete examination vaginal wall relaxation uterine descensus prolapse evaluate stress incontinence
figures
show normal anatomy female pelvis external genitalia
pelvic examination must done database female patient complete
pelvic examination harm patient omission responsible failure make potentially fatal diagnoses
example complete gynecologic examination includes sites malignancies develop female breast cervix endometrium ovary rectum bladder vulva
patients vaginal bleeding third trimester pregnancy pelvic examination done operating room cesarean section performed immediately placenta previa found hemorrhage occurs
emphasized gynecologic patients must made comfortable examination examination must conducted gentle manner otherwise examination probably frustrated patient involuntary muscular resistance
true every patient every examination especially important patient first gynecologic examination
patients embarrassed undress afraid examination
patients must undressed adequate examination proper draping prevents unnecessary exposure
also remember patients painful pelvic conditions
occasionally necessary examine patient general anesthesia moderate sedation infrequently desirable supplement pelvic examination laparoscopic investigation
impossible find problem without hurting patient hurting help
patient enjoys gynecologic examination
examination properly explained gently conducted proper attention patient comfort adequate accurate information usually obtained
unusual circumstances necessary resort pelvic examination anesthesia
never omit pelvic examination patient menstruating
menstruation contraindication pelvic examination patient harmed examination
patient calls make appointment yearly gynecologic examination pap smear appointment given time menstruating simply pap smear somewhat accurate absence menstrual blood
guilty writing patient chart pelvic deferred patient menstruating
