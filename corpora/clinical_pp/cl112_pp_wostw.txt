ocular discomfort pain symptoms distressing patient physician alike
awareness various types eye symptoms pathogenesis clinical significance allows examiner narrow diagnostic possibilities focus remainder data gathering
following types eye discomfort considerable diagnostic importance see table
foreign body sensation itching photophobia brow ache deep orbital pain tenderness touch pain extraocular motility
often patient ocular symptoms state eye hurts examiner unable help patient specific expressing symptoms
unfortunate great deal information lost pursuing ocular history cases
elicit symptom foreign body sensation following questions asked feel grain sand eyelash eye blink away
much comfortable eyes closed
bother lot open close eyes
similarly useful ask patient whether eye discomfort like eyelash eye headache around eye
answer question often differentiate conditions involving ocular surface associated deeper intraocular inflammation
patient complains itching burning tearing helpful ask disturbing symptom
answer itching patient states stop rubbing eyes useful information obtained
photophobia painful spasm bright light usually obvious speaking patient bright room patient display discomfort guarding ptosis
confirmatory yet nonleading question might eyes noticeably comfortable light dark
foreign body sensation occur nerves within tarsal conjunctiva stimulated irregular ocular surface actual foreign body
often however corneal abrasion example foreign body sensation caused breaks conical epithelial layer exposing sensitive sensory nerves painfully stimulated normal blinking
purpose pressure dressing corneal abrasion splint eyelids shut preventing pain caused eyelid excursions exposed corneal nerves
itching often suggests type hypersensitivity cosinophilic response separated less specific ocular surface symptoms burning tearing
significant photophobia usually associated severe ocular surface disease likely intraocular inflammation
pain induced exposure bright light represents ciliary muscle spasm explains use parasympatholytic drops atropine iridocyclitis painful spasm prevented pharmacologically paralyzing ciliary muscle
iridocyclitis diagnosed ophthalmologist use slit lamp biomicroscope
instrument presence inflammatory cells anterior chamber evidence increased vascular permeability anterior segment eye appreciated
photophobia like perilimbal conjunctival hyperemia suggests presence intraocular inflammation
must differentiated burning diffuse conjunctival hyperemia combination associated ordinary conjunctivitis
pain extraocular movement unusual highly suggestive symptom retrobulbar optic neuritis
caused irritation extraocular muscles surrounding inflamed intraorbital optic nerve
