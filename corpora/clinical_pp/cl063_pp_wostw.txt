glossopharyngeal nerve lesions produce difficulty swallowing impairment taste posterior one third tongue palate impaired sensation posterior one third tongue palate pharynx absent gag reflex dysfunction parotid gland
vagus nerve lesions produce palatal pharyngeal paralysis laryngeal paralysis abnormalities esophageal motility gastric acid secretion gallbladder emptying heart rate autonomic dysfunction
see section v autonomic nervous system detailed treatment autonomic functions nerves
listen patient talk taking history
hoarseness whispering nasal speech complaint aspiration regurgitation liquids nose make especially mindful abnormality
give patient glass water see choking complaints swallowed
patient open mouth inspect palatal arch side asymmetry
use tongue blade depress base tongue gently necessary
ask patient say ahhh long possible
observe palatal arches contract soft palate swings back order close nasopharynx oropharynx
normal palatal arches constrict elevate uvula remain midline elevated
paralysis elevation constriction affected side
warn patient going test gag reflex
gently touch first one palatal arch tongue blade waiting time gagging
laryngoscopy necessary evaluate vocal cord

two groups motor sensory nuclei serve nerves
located medulla
nucleus ambiguus motor nucleus located mid upper medulla
supplies striated branchial muscles pharynx larynx upper esophagus via ninth tenth eleventh nerves
supranuclear innervations lower part precentral gyrus partly crossed partly uncrossed
multiple connections nuclei neighboring brainstem nuclei coordination swallowing gagging coughing
motor nuclei dorsal motor nucleus x inferior salivary nucleus ix located medulla dorsal lateral twelfth nucleus
parasympathetic fibers originating nuclei supply smooth muscles pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiovascular systems
cause secretion various glands gastrointestinal system
principal supranuclear control hypothalamus may cortical innervation
sensory nuclei include solitary tract nucleus also known gustatory nucleus
long nuclear column extending length medulla located lateral dorsal motor nucleus vagus receives sensory fibers ninth tenth seventh via nervus intermedius nerves
sensory fibers carried ninth nerve cell station superior petrosal ganglion
include following
taste posterior third tongue see chapter discussion taste
chemoreceptor baroreceptor impulses carotid glomus carotid sinus
general sensation posterior portion oral cavity
sensory fibers carried tenth nerve cell station nodose jugular ganglion
include following
visceral sensory impulses pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiac systems
chemoreceptor baroreceptor impulses aorta carotid arteries
second sensory group comprises nucleus spinal tract trigeminal nerve see chapter trigeminal nerve description nucleus
pain temperature impulses certain parts ear reach nucleus via petrosal ganglion ninth jugular ganglion tenth nerve
pain sensation dura posterior fossa also travels via jugular ganglion
roots ninth tenth nerves exit together medulla leave skull jugular foramen company eleventh nerve
superior petrosal ganglia glossopharyngeal nerve jugular foramen
nerve descends side pharynx enters pharynx
areas supplied include posterior third tongue posterior pharynx soft palate stylopharyngeus muscle pharyngeal plexus secretory glandular fibers areas
leaving jugular foramen vagus nerve courses internal carotid sheath widely distributed upper gastrointestinal system
exceptions supplies muscles soft palate pharynx larynx addition structures pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiovascular systems previously mentioned
ganglia nodose jugular
practical purposes ninth nerve tested separately isolated lesions almost unknown
cerebellopontine angle eighth ninth nerves involved tumors
jugular foramen ninth tenth eleventh nerves involved e g glomus tumor masses
diphtheria cause ninth nerve paralysis
glossopharyngeal neuralgia similar trigeminal neuralgia occur rarely
consists stabbing lancinating pain base tongue around palate
vagus nerve many ramifications clinical significance befits complex nerve

bilateral supranuclear denervation leads dysphagia dysarthria
occurs condition known pseudobulbar palsy
multiple small lesions cortex andor brainstem interrupt corticobulbar supply motor nuclei various cranial nerves
etiologies include multiple sclerosis hypertensive lacunes causes bihemispheric disease
bilateral nuclear involvement vagus causes death pharyngeal laryngeal paralysis cardiac arrhythmias
unilateral nuclear infranuclear involvement vagus causes ipsilateral paralysis soft palate pharynx larynx
voice hoarse nasal involved palatal arch paralyzed liquids enter nasopharynx trachea
vocal cord involved side paralyzed
causes include meningitis carotid aneurysms neoplasms trauma diphtheria
diseases involve peripheral nerves diabetes amyloidosis toxins lead produce neuropathies nerves
neoplasms involve nerve point course
recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis important condition
paralysis vocal cord ipsilaterally
voice may hoarse normal lesion discoverable laryngoscopy
bilateral recurrent laryngeal paralysis produces paralysis cords whispering voice stridor even death due tracheal obstruction cords
causes recurrent laryngeal damage include surgery neoplasms thyroid cervical adenopathy cause aortic aneurysms mediastinal tumors lead poisoning
swallow syncope unconsciousness produced swallowing rare complication ninth tenth nerve lesions
probable mechanism vasovagal reflex produced esophageal distention resulting cardiac inhibition
similar syncopal syndrome reported glossopharyngeal neuralgia
