organic impotence refers inability obtain erection firm enough vaginal penetration inability sustain erection completion intercourse
contrast psychogenic impotence impotence caused anxiety guilt depression conflict around various sexual issues organic impotence common two categories erectile dysfunction caused physical problems
ten middle aged men much higher percentage elderly men impotent
aside importance common distressing sexual problem organic impotence may herald important medical problems
first step evaluation erectile dysfunction determine whether due organic psychogenic causes
usually requires clinical laboratory data
specialized tests become important specific diagnoses considered
history useful distinguishing organic psychogenic impotence table
patient organic impotence describes problems erection progress months years
first patient partial erections seemingly firm erections become flaccid intercourse
time total erectile failure ensues
organic impotence constant nonselective meaning better worse specific partner type stimulation
contrast psychogenic impotence typically abrupt onset often relation psychological trauma may wax wane
patients psychogenic impotence may total erectile failure one partner another impotent sexual intercourse self stimulation
normally occurring spontaneous erections morning suggest psychogenic rather organic causes impotence
patient whose history suggests organic impotence history physical laboratory data help identify cause
classification listed table
based pathophysiologic scheme presented includes mechanical problems interfere erection
vascular disease common cause impotence
advanced cases lehriche syndrome aortoiliac occlusion suggested bilateral thigh calf claudication loss muscle mass buttocks legs impotence
however majority patients vascular impotence less severe vascular disease many occlusive disease hypogastric cavernous bed
even among patients without claudication vascular disease still likely cause impotence especially risk factors atherosclerosis present
nonatherosclerotic disease consideration patient history trauma radiation pelvis cause fibrosis vessels
impotence may presenting symptom vascular disease neurologic disease impotence generally occurs setting obvious nervous system disorder typically patients known spinal cord pathology neuropathy
impotent patients questioned decreased genital sensation would suggest diabetic alcoholic forms neuropathy weakness may accompany multiple sclerosis spinal cord tumors back pain bowel bladder symptoms raise concern cauda equina syndrome
careful drug history important evaluation impotence
drugs cause impotence table
generally interfering neurotransmission
endocrine problems though uncommon considered patients presenting impotence
rule impotence due hypogonadism partial accompanied decreased libido
hypothalmic pituitary problems include tumors common endocrine disorders causing impotence followed primary gonadal failure one many causes
poorly controlled diabetes polyuria polydypsia important reversible cause impotence hyperthyroidism
certain drugs alcohol included lead impotence result endocrine disturbances
finally history may suggest one several mechanical causes impotence peyronie disease congenital acquired abnormalities penis
examination vascular system particularly relevant evaluation impotent patient
absence pulses feet presence femoral bruits suggest atherosclerosis
however normal femoral pedal pulses exclude selective obstruction penile blood flow
direct palpation dorsal artery penis may informative pulsation absent
presence pulse however rule vascular disease particularly patient able achieve normal erections rest unable maintain thrusting

penis becomes rigid blood flow corpora cavernosa increases sixfold venous outflow physiologically impeded
penile perfusion governed three organ systemsthe neurologic circulatory endocrinologic systemseach necessary potency
neurologic system accounts vasodilation venoconstriction corporal blood vessels blood shunted erectile tissues circulatory system provides adequate blood flow hypogastric cavernous bed distal branch internal iliac vessels endocrine system mediated testosterone plays permissive role mechanisms yet elucidated
neurologic pathways required erection originate cerebral cortex visual auditory psychic stimuli processed pudenal nerve afferent nerve transmits tactile sensations genitals sacral segments spinal cord cortex
efferent signals spinal cord pass along pelvic parasympathetic nerves dilate corporal vessels
specific neurotransmitters fully defined acetylcholine perhaps vasoactive intestinal peptide appears important
many causes neurogenic impotence
anything disrupts neural pathways blocks neurochemical transmission adverse effect erection
psychologic factors probably interfere erection inhibiting corticosacral efferent pathways
circulatory system plays central role obtaining sustaining erections

vascular lesionstypically atherosclerotic occasionally fibroticand systemic hypotension limit flow corpora
certain patients blood flow rest may sufficient obtain erection sufficient maintain intercourse pelvic musculature places greater demands compromised blood supply
testosterone necessary normal libido plays permissive role potency
hypogonadism seen primary testicular problems pituitary hypothalmic abnormalities associated impotence improves androgen replacement

apparent likely causes impotence considered first possible eliminated work continues
instance observing patient weeks offending medication may necessary establish cause impotence
obvious remediable cause present next step based clinical impression likelihood organic versus psychologic impotence
latter considered likely perfectly reasonable refer patient directly sexual therapy option reconsidering diagnosis appropriate therapy improvement
occasional patient organic impotence misrouted many psychogenic impotence spared unnecessary costly evaluation organic causes
organic impotence likely serum testosterone level initial screening test hypogonadism obtained prior urologic referral
patients low testosterone levels require endocrine evaluations depicted figure
