slowing pulse rate bradycardia may seen heart block hypothyroidism use certain drugs e g propranolol
irregularities pulse suggest presence premature beats completely irregular pulse implies presence atrial fibrillation
diminished absent pulses various arteries examined may indicative impaired blood flow due variety conditions
bruits rushing sounds heard large medium sized arteries result vibration vessel wall caused turbulent blood flow
sound may originate local narrowing dilation vessel may transmitted along artery proximal lesion vascular system
intensity duration bruit relate degree vessel wall distortion
general bruits audible artery approximately occluded
sound increases pitch lumen becomes narrowed critical size
thereafter sound may longer detectable volume blood flow becomes greatly reduced
complete physical examination includes assessment recording arterial pulses locations
examining pulse observer note intensity rate rhythm blood vessel tenderness tortuosity nodularity exists
unreliable attempt estimate blood pressure via arterial palpation without use sphygmomanometer
