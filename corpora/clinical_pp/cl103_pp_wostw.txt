initial physical examination cutaneous abnormalities noted using appropriate morphologic descriptive terms
skin lesion described one following generic nouns macule papule plaque nodule tumor vesicle bulla pustule wheal telangiectasis comedo burrow cyst
primary lesions morphologic changes representative pathologic process basis diagnostic categories dermatologic disease
primary lesions discovered diligent examination history represent first lesions experienced patient
primary lesions altered external factors secondary changes seen scale crust fissure erosion ulcer excoriation atrophy scar
appropriate adjectives color flesh white red purple brown surface smooth rough feel soft firm tender added primary secondary terms evoke accurate image minds reading database
note accurate image imply diagnosis generic descriptive terminology
examiner avoid costs temptation jump diagnostic conclusion rapidly many unrelated skin conditions share generic morphologic similarities
nevus one examiner may seborrheic keratosis melanoma another
correct accurate term case might mm brown papule
