complaint abdominal gas usually refers chronic belching abdominal distention bloating excessive rectal flatulence combination symptoms
patients often complain much gas
essential initial step evaluating complaint ask meant much gas
clinician must determine whether excessive belching whether bloating present whether patient passing excessive rectal gas
belching problem patient must questioned oral intake substances known release excessive amounts gas stomach example carbonated soft drinks beer effervescent forms certain medications
attempting establish relationship substances symptom belching clinician must also determine quantities used time used
regard belching equally important consider possibility air swallowing associated several factors
excess air often swallowed along excess saliva stimulated habitual use substances lozenges tobacco products chewing gum
similar situation occur chronic posterior nasal discharge
air often enters esophagus food liquids ingested simultaneously large volumes liquid drunk gulping fashion
clinician must also consider conditions associated mouth dryness
state usually prompts patient carry smacking movements attempt wet lips oral cavity air swallowing often accompanies movements
sj√∂gren syndrome radiation therapy neck often reduce secretion saliva
much common cause dry mouth however use medications anticholinergic side effects
air swallowing also occur either habit response stress
although patient may noted whether swallowing movements precede belching worth seeking information
fact process taking history clinician observing whether swallowing precedes eructation gas
since air swallowing frequently associated stress questions might relate symptom stressful situations may particularly useful
complaint abdominal bloating patient usually referring sensation generalized abdominal fullness
times patient attempt document symptom relating changes tightness clothing visible changes size abdomen
times symptom fullness may present without visible changes
questioning determine whether symptom occurs daily occasionally whether related ingestion certain substances whether symptom relieved belching passing rectal gas using medications
regard excessive rectal flatulence several questions may helpful
patient noted association symptom particular food substances
relationship rectal gas consumption milk milk products
apply also yogurt cream
regard information regarding patient ethnic background may particularly useful
patient northern middle european extraction patient ethnic roots stem southern europe asia africa
patient eat certain legumes breads
patient stools float sink
gas introduced gastrointestinal tract several ways
although familiar belch produced immediately following drinking carbonated beverage common antecedent belching air swallowing aerophagia
radiologically demonstrated swallowed air usually goes partway esophagus eructated
consistent analysis eructated gas typically reveals belch consist nitrogen oxygen proportions found ambient air
since swallowed air occasionally enters stomach uncommon plain x ray films abdomen demonstrate postbelch enlargement rather diminution gastric air bubble cases
swallowed air enter stomach mixture gases becomes altered vascular gastric mucosa utilize oxygen allow oxygen diffuse across mucosa bloodstream
time carbon dioxide diffuses blood gastric lumen
thus concentration nitrogen gastric lumen remains unchanged concentration oxygen decreases slightly concentration carbon dioxide increases slightly
composition gaseous mixture altered duodenum bicarbonate biliary pancreatic secretions reacts hydrochloric fatty acids delivered stomach
neutralization reactions produce large amounts carbon dioxide water
fact canine studies demonstrated average duodenal pco mm hg fasting state increasing mm hg feeding
normal presence carbon dioxide duodenum likely accounts symptoms postprandial bloating fatty food intolerance patients increased sensitivity intestinal distention
much excess carbon dioxide produced duodenum reabsorbed proximal part jejunum carried blood lungs exhaled
consequently time gaseous mixture reaches colon partial pressure carbon dioxide similar noted mixture gases originally entered duodenum stomach
source rectal gas attributed primarily air swallowing since five gases constitute intestinal gas twonitrogen oxygenare present atmosphere appreciable amounts
three intestinal gasesmethane hydrogen carbon dioxideresult metabolic processes bacterial flora colon
humans production methane confined colon partial pressure gas reaches high mm hg
much produced absorbed portal blood delivery lungs
one three adults consistently possesses strictly anaerobic bacteria capable producing significant quantities methane
capacity appears familial phenomenon unrelated dietary factors
offspring two methane producers chance methane producers
one parent produces methane offspring chance producing methane
neither parent produces methane less chance production methane offspring
familial tendency appears environmental rather genetic results colonization colon methane producing bacteria early life contamination actual birthing process contact family members infancy
methane production becomes detectable first postnatal weeks reaches adult level age years
incorporation methane fecal material commonly accounts floating stools healthy subjects
even patients malabsorption floating stools result likely gas water content fat content
bacteria produce hydrogen carbon dioxide metabolic products much generally distributed population similarly confined colon
bacteria depend substrates fermented substances mainly carbohydrates indigestible unabsorbable small intestine
one substance patients small intestinal lactase deficiency lactose sugar milk
lactase deficiency may transiently occur result acute illness small intestine may occur long term basis result chronic enteric disease
commonly long term lactose deficiency develops sometime first two decades life autosomal recessive basis
thus people ethnic origins northern western european impaired ability break lactose absorbable components glucose galactose
degree impairment lactose absorption subjects varies reaching high usually
variation accounts wide range lactose tolerance even among lactase deficient subjects
addition even normal subjects fail absorb lactose load
interestingly lactase deficient individuals tolerate yogurt milk product contains amount lactose found unconcentrated milk
consistent observation breath hydrogen studies indicate reduced symptoms flatulence diarrhea yogurt compared milk correspond reduced gaseous fermentation products yogurt used
phenomenon attributed beta galactosidase lactase contributed yogurt two bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus streptococcus thermophilus used preparation
lactase deficient individuals also tolerate products made cream since lactose water soluble contained mostly aqueous portion milk
consistent poor tolerance ice cream made mostly milk
people baked beans soybeans legumes also result increased production hydrogen carbon dioxide colonic bacteria
although indigestible oligosaccharides long regarded main substrates reactions recent evidence points starch malabsorbed normal human small bowel major source fermentable material following ingestion complex carbohydrates
fermentation products follow ingestion flours since contain carbohydrate absorbed small intestine carbohydrate thus enters colon
gluten appears impair complete absorption starch flours even many otherwise normal people celiac disease
one flour virtually completely absorbed rice flour contain gluten
foods contain substances nondigestible nonabsorbable enter colon participate bacterial fermentation processes
mushrooms contain disaccharide trehalose
prunes raisins contain small nonabsorbable fatty acid
nonabsorbable sugars long familiar saccharin increasingly used sorbitol contained many called sugarless gums candies contribute diarrhea increased production colonic gas particularly taken large quantities
amount hydrogen gas produced depends type quantity various substrates also type colonic flora
bacteria vary capacity convert carbohydrate hydrogen
furthermore hydrogen produced actually expelled rectally
hydrogen consumed colonic bacteria phenomenon may partially explain unsuccessful attempts treating flatulence antibiotics
large portion hydrogen absorbed portal blood eventual excretion lungs
excretory pathway enabled breath analysis used study intestinal gas production
another approach study intestinal gas washout technique inert gas argon
infusion argon proximal jejunum allowed washout intestinal gas collection means rectal tube
analysis collected gas confirmed five major components intestinal gas nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide hydrogen methane
note five gases constitute nearly bowel gas nonodorous
human ability detect presence extremely small quantities malodorous gases hydrogen sulfide credited remarkable capacity olfactory sense
studies also demonstrate colon contains virtually oxygen finding likely attributable consumption oxygen colonic bacteria
nitrogen may present colon varying amounts
may swallowed air
colon nitrogen may retained result production methane hydrogen carbon dioxide effectively lowers luminal pn thereby prevents absorption swallowed nitrogen
furthermore high colonic nitrogen gradients conceivably may result diffusion nitrogen colonic lumen
argon washout technique also used determine volume gas present intestinal tract
studies normal subjects demonstrated intestine contains relatively small quantities gas ranging cc
interest similar small amounts gas frequently found patients common complaint bloating abdominal distention
observations consistent radiologic studies show correlation presence absence bloating symptoms volume gas present intestinal tract
number patients bloating poorly tolerated infusion argon intestinal tract sometimes degree infusion stopped
painful response usually associated delayed transit argon intestine occasionally reflux infused gas intestine stomach
observations suggest called functional symptoms bloating abdominal pain many patients may due much excessive amount gas increased sensitivity intestinal tract usual amounts gas present
gas chromatic gc mass spectrometric ms techniques utilized analyze volatile substances produce fecal odor
recently generally accepted skatole indole benzopyrrole end products anaerobic metabolism amino acids colonic microflora primarily account fecal odor
however gc odor ms analysis indicated volatile methyl sulfidesmethanethiol dimethyl disulfide dimethyl trisulfideare likely responsible malodor feces
hydrogen sulfide gas may minimal impact odor particularly considering larger concentrations methanethiol odor distinguished hydrogen sulfide
exogenous sources fecal odorants cocoa beer coffee variety vegetables play minimal role
major source fecal odor endogenous specifically metabolism non absorbable food substances enteric bacteria
characterization metabolites could conceivably contribute controlling odor flatus
evaluation management problem abdominal gas hinges clear understanding meaning patient complaint
belching main problem clinician must determine whether relationship symptom variety possible etiologic factors
eructation follow large meals ingestion carbonated beverages
patient constantly dry mouth chronic postnasal discharge associated frequent swallowing efforts
patient developed habit making swallowing movements belch
symptoms worse moments stress
important questions enable clinician determine likely cause symptoms therapeutic approach may beneficial
awareness bloating may due increased sensitivity patient usual amounts gas present intestine may help clinician manage problem appropriately thereby avoiding ineffective therapeutic measures
frequently helpful patient clinician look symptoms disturbances intestinal motility
finally knowing bacterial flora produces colonic hydrogen carbon dioxide knowing gas production depends availability nonabsorbable fermentable substrates clinician begin approach problem excessive rectal flatulence determining patient ethnic background obtaining dietary history
initial steps may allow modifications patient diet avoiding expense discomfort inconvenience associated elaborate diagnostic studies would likely contribute little toward management problem
