movement disorders include tremor chorea athetosis myoclonus asterixis
tremor consists purposeless involuntary movements resulting alternating contractions opposing muscle groups
tremor rest occurs muscles rest example pill rolling tremor parkinsonism
postural tremor occurs muscles maintain posture outstretched arms example fine tremor hyperthyroidism
action tremor intention tremor occurs near end goal directed movement example coarse side side tremor cerebellar disease seen finger nose test done
chorea series brief jerky explosive movements fidgeting example sydenham chorea seen rheumatic fever
athetosis writhing sinuous movements especially marked digits extremities occur hepatic encephalopathy
myoclonus consists sudden brief twitches jerks groups muscles single muscle seen metabolic encephalopathies uremic encephalopathy
asterixis liver flap intermittency sustained posture illustrated flapping hands arms outstretched wrists dorsiflexed hepatic encephalopathy
foot flap seen many patients asterixis hands
abnormal movements often observed taking history performing parts physical examination
movements observed suspected studied carefully inspecting patient rest maintaining posture erect outstretched arms performing goal directed movements finger nose finger test
systematically inspect resting patient beginning face proceeding upper extremities trunk lower extremities
chorea produces sudden grimaces facethe patient unable keep tongue protruded darts
inspect tongue rests inside mouth certain types tremor involve tongue
myoclonic twitches seen quite well shoulders distal upper extremities
restless fidgeting purposeless movements arms among earliest signs chorea
sinuous twistings hand seen athetosis
patient maintain posture standing arms outstretched slightly flexed elbow hands extended wrist though halting traffic
look following signs
asterixis hands flap flex briefly wrist immediately snap back extended position
foot flap often brought patient dorsiflex feet maintain position
flap identical seen hands
posture also well suited bringing abnormalities produced chorea athetosis myoclonus since produce changes position limb
certain tremors provoked sustained posture
observe carefully distal postural tremors fine rapid tremor hands seen hyperthyroidism
tremors involving shoulders neck produce head bobbing neck affected coarse tremors entire arm shoulder girdle involved
observe voluntary goal directed movements
ask patient perform finger nose finger test see chapter cerebellum watch tremors usually occur maximally goal reached
note whether involved segments distal wrist fingers proximal shoulder helps neuroanatomical localization
coarse side side tremor characteristic cerebellar disease
chorea manifested break interruption performance intended smooth voluntary movement
following information recorded abnormal movements
structures segments involved state muscles occur rest maintaining posture goal directed movements description movements including pattern involvement various segments duration frequency factors increase decrease movements rest exercise anxiety alcohol
progress influence treatment tremors involve hands followed patient write sentence draw archimedes spiral visit
mechanisms underlying involuntary movements poorly understood
extrapyramidal motor system clearly involved certain tremors chorea athetosis
system refers anatomically basal ganglia caudate putamen globus pallidus amygdala related brainstem reticular formation
experimental evidence also suggests ventral lateral nucleus thalamus cerebral cortex involved
disease cerebellum brainstem connections produces coarse action tremor
tremor experimentally reproduced lesions dentate nucleus brachium conjunctivum contains large number projection fibers dentate nucleus
clinically lesions cerebellum brachium conjunctivum prior decussation produce ipsilateral tremor
myoclonus seen wide variety disturbances
important form occurs multiple muscle groups association metabolic encephalopathy especially uremic carbon dioxide encephalopathy
circumstances myoclonus presumably indicates neuronal injury
however specific pathophysiology unknown
asterixis described adams foley seen many metabolic encephalopathies
physiologically electromyogram shows lapse electrical activity muscle wrist flaps followed compensatory muscle contraction jerks hand
neurophysiology known
pill rolling tremor parkinsonism present rest
coarse regular movement involving thumb index finger
although tremor predominantly involves distal upper extremity face tongue may involved also
sleep decreases tremor emotion makes worse
tremor often increases patient walks
causes tremor rest rarer
include drug induced tremors principally phenothiazines severe cases essential tremor benign familial tremor wilson disease chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration mercury poisoning general paresis
generalization proximal postural tremorsthose involving shoulder pelvic girdle neckare produced lesions cerebellum brainstem connections
usually coarse slow
distal postural tremors involving wrists finger joints result midbrain basal ganglia problems
many fine rapid
however exceptions generalizations many cases site neurologic dysfunction really known
common postural tremors follows
anxiety fatigue tremors fine rapid tremors involving fingers
injection epinephrine normal individuals produces tremors identical seen anxiety fatigue
thyrotoxicosis fine rapid tremor fingers identical tremors listed
essential benign familial tremor coarse irregular tremor usually starts hands fingers eventually involves voice head neck
usually becomes worse goal directed movements
difficulty handwriting piano playing typing drinking coffee often prominent complaint
drinking alcohol diminishes tremor
strong heritable tendency
onset early adult life
treatment propranolol efficacious patients
cerebellar tremor coarse irregular tremor involving shoulder girdle neck seen patients diseases cerebellum
prime example alcoholic cerebellar cortical degeneration
quite severe present rest also
lithium tremor seen individuals treated lithium
quite similar essential tremor
postural tremors also seen wilson disease acquired hepatocerebral degeneration certain poisons especially mercury
mercury poisoning known hatter shakes workers involved manufacture felt hats exposed mercury
action intention tremors seen voluntary activity usually prominent near end goal directed movement
generalizations localization apply given postural tremors
good example coarse side side tremor seen cerebellar disease finger approaches nose
note although speak finger actual origin tremor elbow shoulder joint
foregoing statements tremors generalizations numerous exceptions
however form useful bedside approach analysis tremor disorders
final diagnosis based analysis addition meticulous history physical examination
sydenham chorea seen children adolescents often associated rheumatic fever
huntington chorea autosomal dominant disorder usually appears adulthood
chorea gravidarum seen pregnancy
chorea reported large variety conditions especially diseases lupus erythematosus cerebral arteritis
athetosis occurring childhood involves sides body double athetosis thought due neonatal cerebral hypoxia
adults usually involves one side body seen often strokes
myoclonus involving multiple muscle groups frequently occurs patients metabolic encephalopathies produced uremia carbon dioxide hypoxia
asterixis first described hepatic encephalopathy
also seen metabolic disorders uremia hypokalemia carbon dioxide narcosis due chronic pulmonary disease dialysis dementia hypoxia hypomagnesemia
asterixis caused following drugs dilantin phenobarbital carbamazepine primidone perhaps diazepam flurazepam
structural lesions producing asterixis even unilateral asterixis located midbrain thalamus
combination myoclonus asterixis patient stupor strongly suggests metabolic encephalopathy rather structural brain lesion cause
