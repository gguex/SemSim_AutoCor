normal adult spleen lies immediately diaphragm left upper quadrant abdomen
ranges length cm weight g
spleen normally palpable except slender young adults
spleen felt left costal margin rest inspiration splenic enlargement assumed explanation sought
although normal size even abnormally small spleen involved pathologic processes exception rubs associated splenic infarcts physical examination generally helpful identifying problem
nevertheless enlarged palpable spleen important clue presence variety illnesses
examining left upper quadrant abdomen foremost examiner mind question whether spleen enlarged
examiner intend feel spleen
perfunctory examination assuming spleen going palpable best way miss enlarged spleen
approach part physical examination operate hypothesis spleen enlarged convinced incorrect best attempts confirm hypothesis fail
four physical examining techniquesinspection auscultation palpation percussionis important examining splenic enlargement
examiner begin observing patient abdomen inspiration
extremely enlarged spleen lead observation splenic edge descending left upper lower abdomen extreme case right abdomen
spleen seen left upper quadrant auscultated inspiration
maneuvers inspection auscultation efficiently incorporated initial part entire abdominal examination
left upper quadrant left lower ribs anteriorly laterally auscultated evidence splenic rub e coarse scratching sound coincident inspiration
splenic rub especially sought patients complaining left upper quadrant pain pain top left shoulder associated inspiration patients recent trauma left upper quadrant
palpation left upper quadrant splenic enlargement performed variety ways
examiner use techniques comfortable always perform exactly manner order
standard approach key avoiding mistakes
palpation splenic enlargement begin patient supine knees flexed
using right hand examiner begin well left costal margin feel gently firmly splenic edge pushing cephalad releasing figure
maneuver repeated working toward left costal margin
spleen felt left costal margin patient breathing quietly left hand placed behind left lateral ribs right left costal margin figure
patient instruction examiner inspire deeply
examiner right hand repeat maneuver pressing cephalad releasing
performed right hand mid left costal margin laterally examiner finds spleen convinced feel splenic edge
splenic edge frequently sharp feel rounded
spleen still felt patient placed right lateral position approached one two ways see figures
depending preferred examiner
either case examiner position hand movements repeated patient inspires deeply
noted maneuver performed examiner standing behind patient fingers hooked costal margin
maneuvers done minutes examiner confident technique
left upper quadrant mass found important consider might spleen
frequent organ confused enlarged spleen enlarged left kidney
position abdomen characteristics palpated edge movement inspiration usually sufficient identify confidence enlarged spleen
question exists however resolved abdominal ultrasound examination
maneuvers fail demonstrate splenic enlargement appropriate use percussion final step
supine right lateral positions left upper quadrant immediately costal margin left lower rib margin percussed inspiration expiration
dullness present expiration present inspiration suggest presence enlarged spleen descended inspiration
case palpation repeated try confirm impression
normal adult spleen contributes homeostasis body removing blood useless potentially injurious materials e g abnormal wornout red blood cells microorganisms synthesizing immunoglobulins properdin
splenic enlargement associated decreased increased function depending cause enlarged spleen
causes splenic enlargement include vascular congestion e g portal hypertension secondary cirrhosis splenic vein thrombosis reticuloendothelial hyperplasia e g systemic infections typhoid fever endocarditis work hypertrophy e g certain hemolytic anemias infiltrative processes e g tumor extramedullary hematopoiesis amyloidosis
splenic enlargement associated change splenic function frequently associated splenic hyperfunction
reflected peripheral blood thrombocytopenia leukopenia rapid red blood cell destruction combination findings
clinical syndrome enlarged spleen peripheral cytopenias often referred hypersplenism
splenic enlargement secondary infiltrative process e tumors amyloidosis splenic hypofunction result
reflected peripheral blood howell jolly bodies abnormal red blood cell forms
presence enlarged spleen lead examination peripheral blood physician
presence enlarged spleen frequently clue puts physical findings perspective leads correct diagnosis
splenic enlargement finding never ignored
differential diagnosis extensive
table
gives one approach categorizing causes splenic enlargement
extremely important correlate presence enlarged spleen historical findings physical findings laboratory results x ray findings identify cause splenic enlargement particular patient
example vascular spiders red palms small testes patient splenic enlargement would strongly suggest liver disease etiology
roth spots new heart murmur would suggest endocarditis
extensive lymphadenopathy weight loss night sweats enlarged spleen would suggest malignant lymphoproliferative disease
making correlations possible utilize presence enlarged spleen plan patient subsequent evaluation quickly efficiently reach correct diagnosis
