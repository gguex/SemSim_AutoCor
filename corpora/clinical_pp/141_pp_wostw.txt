glucose important carbohydrate fuel body
fed state majority circulating glucose comes diet fasting state gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis maintain glucose concentrations
little glucose found diet glucose found complex carbohydrates broken monosaccharides though digestive process
half total carbohydrates diet form polysaccharides remainder simpler sugars
two thirds sugar diet sucrose disaccharide glucose fructose
glucose classified monosaccharide broken hydrolysis
classified hexose six carbon skeleton aldose presence aldehyde group carbon
aldehyde group condenses hydroxyl group glucose exists hemiacetal ring structure
ring structure explains many reactions glucose
ordinarily concentration glucose blood maintained relatively stable concentration mgdl
strong reducing properties glucose made relatively easy measure thus clinical estimation circulating glucose one earliest tests available clinician
recent introduction microglucose oxidase technology made possible patient measure blood glucose concentration undoubtedly makes estimation blood glucose widely used test blood chemistry
understanding methods blood glucose measurement help clinician interpret values avoid pitfalls inaccurate testing
concentration glucose highest arterial circulation
laboratory determinations usually done venous samples
venous circulation delayed leaving tourniquet prolonged period time concentration falls even
thus samples obtained releasing tourniquet
studies shown blood glucose concentration may fall much mgdl tourniquet left place minutes
concentration glucose capillary samples intermediate venous arterial
warming extremity increases capillary flow arterializes sample cooling tourniquet decreases flow lowers concentration glucose
red cells leukocytes contain glycolytic enzymes
therefore glucose consumed concentration glucose sample whole blood decline time
rate loss generally said approximately per hour may rapid hours
consumption glucose whole blood samples prevented adding sodium fluoride specimen inhibit glycolytic enzymes
approach generally applied method clinical laboratory
effective except situations system overwhelmed specimens patients leukemia contain large numbers leukocytes
sodium fluoride major disadvantage use makes sample unacceptable determinations sodium uric acid
rapid separation sample cooling also prevent glycolysis allow sample used determinations
unhemolyzed samples separated within minutes drawing generally considered adequate
rapid cooling sample followed centrifugation even effective preventing glycolysis
methods require attention detail therefore suitable routine laboratory use
occasion circumstances require glucose concentration determined ordinary serum sample
specimen promptly centrifuged reasonable ask laboratory measure glucose concentration even though sodium fluoride green top tube used
glucose concentration may determined whole blood plasma serum samples
whole blood used concentration lower plasma serum used
due greater water content cellular fraction
usual circumstances concentration glucose whole blood lower plasma serum difference less patients low hematocrits
blood glucose determined accurately postmortem specimens glycogenolysis glycolysis continue death
reasonable estimate antemortem blood glucose concentration obtained measuring glucose concentration vitreous eye contain glycolytic enzymes
glucose oxidase reagents measure generation hydrogen peroxide bonded filter paper system used measure glucose concentrations drop capillary blood
resulted important change diabetes management since introduction insulin
patients instructed obtain blood sample pricking fingertip lancet
spring loaded lancets available
easy use cause minimal discomfort
surprisingly many patients consider discomfort finger stick preferable inconvenience aesthetic unpleasantness obtaining urine sample testing
drop whole capillary blood placed reagent bonded paper strip
instead using known volume blood excess blood exposed fixed quantity glucose oxidase finite period time estimate concentration
specified time usually minute excess blood removed washing wiping color allowed develop
concentration estimated comparing color chart using portable reflectance meter specific reagent strip measure developed color
reflectance meters measuring blood glucose becoming increasingly sophisticated compact reliable
shirt pocket size models available prototype models store time date result insulin doses later graphic printing patient home physician office developed
undoubtedly reflectance meters access complex algorithms recommending changes insulin dose individualized specific patient possible near future
test reflects long term blood glucose control diabetics concentration hemoglobin ac
hemolysates red cells chromatographed three small peaks named hemoglobin aa ab ac eluted main hemoglobin peak
fast hemoglobins formed irreversible attachment glucose hemoglobin two step reaction
percentage hemoglobin glycosylated depends average glucose concentration red cell exposed time
since average life red cell days percentage glycosylated hemoglobin gives good indication degree blood sugar control preceding weeks
hemoglobin ac quantifiably largest peak laboratories measure selectively although laboratories measure fast hemoglobins
numerous biochemical methods used including electrophoresis mini columns radioimmunoassay high pressure liquid chromatography
unfortunately standards reference methods test
methods include labile hemoglobin ale measurement
reversibly glycosylated hemoglobin dependent current blood glucose concentration falsely elevate results
therefore important know local hospital norms variations

three basic approaches laboratory measurement blood glucose concentration reducing methods condensation methods enzymatic methods
reducing methods oldest take advantage reducing properties glucose change state metal ion glucose oxidized
reducing methods nonspecific strong reducing agent cross react yield spuriously elevated values
steps added remove cross reacting reducing agents approach largely abandoned clinical laboratory
aldehyde group glucose undergo condensation aromatic compounds yield colored product
commonly used condensation reaction toluidine reacts glucose form glucosamine intense green color
color measured spectrophotometrically estimate glucose concentration
reaction rapid intense color allows high degree sensitivity
aldoses cross react mannose galactose give highly colored product
sugars found great concentrations blood cross reactivity ordinarily significant
toluidirie drawback highly corrosive toxic
reason method rapidly phased clinical laboratory
enzyme glucose oxidase reacts glucose water oxygen form gluconic acid hydrogen peroxide
hydrogen peroxide used oxidize chromogen consumption oxygen measured estimate amount glucose present
glucose oxidase specific b glucose cross reaction sugars problem
aqueous solution approximately glucose b state exists glucose
rate interconversion ph temperature dependent
methods add glucomutarostase reagents speed conversion beta anomere seem alter clinical results
measurement generated hydrogen peroxide specific first glucose oxidase reaction
numerous reducing substances potentially inhibit oxidation chromogen
although uric acid creatinine even uremic patients seem little effect results ascorbic acid yield spuriously low blood glucose measurements
high concentration uric acid found urine affect result glucose oxidase methods directly applicable urine samples
measurement oxygen consumption using oxygen specific electrode avoids problem interfering reducing agents
general glucose oxidase method relatively inexpensive specific
hands glucose oxidase strip method accurate reliable
since whole blood used results tend slightly lower simultaneous venous samples balanced fact capillary blood higher glucose concentration venous blood
patients visually estimate correct value patients consistently misread visual charts must use reflectance meter

patients feel comfortable digital readout reflectance meter although necessarily accurate
major sources error failing put large enough drop blood strip inaccurate timing
patients use reflectance meters another source error failure keep machine clean calibrated
color developed relatively stable patients instructed bring developed strips physician office accuracy checked
glucose oxidase strips cost cents reflectance meters average
