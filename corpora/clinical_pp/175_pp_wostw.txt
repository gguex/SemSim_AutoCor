goal breast examination determine breasts normal abnormal
abnormal following may indicated surgical consultation reexamination different time menstrual cycle mammograms possibly ultrasound
basic requirements proper breast examination include following
patient undressed waist
examining table access sides
mobile bright light assistant focus light one area another examination conducted
adequate breast examination performed careful inspection palpation
requires routine planned procedure several changes patient position meticulous palpation entire extent breasts commonly cover anterior chest wall
figure
shows steps thorough breast examination
visual manual examination discloses something suspicious figure maneuvers reexamination required
comparison physical findings one segment breast adjacent breast tissue corresponding segment opposite breast often helpful
borderline area thickening subtle suggestion skin change accurately assessed way
glandular tissue breast suspended within superficial fascia anterior chest wall extending roughly second sixth seventh anterior intercostal space edge sternum midaxillary line
two thirds rests upon fascia covering pectoralis muscle rest upon fascia serratus anterior muscle
toward axilla axillary tail spence passes opening pectoral fascia foramen langer axilla
nonlactating breast weighs g lactating breast may weigh much g
glandular tissue made lobes subdivided lobules composed acini
overlapping lobes ensures cleavage planes exist separate one another
lobes arranged like spokes wheel converging nipple dilated ampulla ends
breast fixed overlying skin underlying pectoral fascia fibrous bands known cooper ligaments
glandular tissue undergoes changes birth old age
birth female male breasts contain simple system large ducts lobules
ducts lined flattened epithelium surrounded collagenous tissue
onset puberty female rapid growth ductal epithelium periductal fibrous stroma increases size breasts quite firm
onset maturity true lobules acinar structures develop
male breast lobules never develop male never develops variety breast cancer called lobular
pregnancy marked proliferation multiplication glandular elements regress normal pregnancy lactation
menopause continuous involution regression breast structures resulting loss glandular elements atrophy breast
cancer significant finding breast examination
tumors variable size irregular shape
contour may poorly defined may thickening breast tissue
exceptions circumscribed variety papillary mucinous medullary comprise less breast cancers
consistency usually hard circumscribed varieties usually soft
mass usually movable relation surrounding breast tissue moved independent skin chest wall except advanced stages disease
tenderness uncommon breast cancers usually solitary
benign cysts vary size
shape may rounded oval discoid contour well defined
consistency rubbery firm though occasional fluctuations seen
benign cysts highly mobile within breast tissue related chest wall skin
except occasional inflamed cyst tenderness absent mild
cysts usually multiple
adenosis papillomatosis fibrous hyperplasia benign solid types cystic disease
masses vary size contour smooth lobulated
commonly involve central upper outer quadrants range diffuse firmness fibrous hyperplasia multiple mm nodules adenosis
three dimensional lesions found
contour poorly defined hyperplasia well defined adenosis
consistency firm hard
lesions limited mobility surrounding breast tissue attached skin chest wall
multiple areas involvement norm
fibroadenomas also vary size
rounded oval commonly lobulated well defined contour
notch similar hilum kidney frequent finding
consistency usually rubbery occasionally may soft
lesions highly mobile hence name slipper tumor
tenderness rare
fibroadenomas commonly multiple occurring either simultaneously sequentially time
nipple discharge may sign duct ectasia stasis intraductal papilloma intraductal carcinoma
bloody single duct spontaneous discharge without small soft mass beneath areola indicative intraductal papilloma
multiple duct nonspontaneous gray green grumous discharge bag worms soft changes beneath areola indicative duct ectasia stasis
skin changes usually associated presence mass may subtle obvious
include erythema edema dilated subcutaneous veins
erythema commonly diffuse acute chronic inflammatory processes inflammatory carcinoma breast
usually localized associated superficial cancer commonly skin involvement trauma fat necrosis breast abscess
edema may due blockage subdermal lymphatics tumor cells inflammatory process within breast axilla
edema produces called peudorange skin change seen locally advanced cancer inflammatory carcinoma
dilated subcutaneous veins associated underlying mass thickening highly suggestive rapidly growing malignant process cancer cystosarcoma phyllodes
convex skin changes usually associated underlying mass lipoma large fibroadenoma cystosarcoma phyllodes
retraction phenomena concave changes skin breast range small area skin flattening vicinity underlying tumor area thickening shrinkage skin breast
usually result shortening cooper ligaments due fibrosis
carcinoma common cause usually associated distinct mass subtle underlying thickening breast tissue
benign causes phenomena inflammation fat necrosis biopsy scars atrophic changes associated ptosis breast commonly lateral nipple areola upper outer quadrants
ulceration skin breast underlying mass area thickening usually due carcinoma
centrally located history recurrent abscesses due end stage duct ectasia stasis chronic recurring subareola abscess
enlarged greater cm rounded firm usually nontender axillary nodes association mass suspicious thickening breast strongly suggest metastatic involvement primary tumor breast
however clinical assessment axillary node status identify metastases best accurate
supraclavicular nodes palpable supraclavicular fossa side ipsilateral suspected proven breast cancer usually due metastases
