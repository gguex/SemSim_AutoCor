diarrhea increase volume weight daily stool
frequency bowel movements usually increased well
diarrhea may mean many things different people
patient subjective experience altered bowel habits may necessarily fit physician criteria diarrhea
patients occurrence single unformed stool enough provoke visit physician diarrhea
thus important physician first determine patient diarrhea proceed characterize
first question asked normal bowel habits changed
allowing patient speak spontaneously one listening important historical factors listed table
frequency size bowel movement important
small frequent bowel movements often indicate left colon rectal disease whereas voluminous stools usually indicate small bowel right colon disease
symptoms interrupt normal sleeping patterns
absence nocturnal diarrhea suggestive functional bowel disease
symptoms acute less days duration chronic
attempt elicit description stool abnormal bowel movements like
stools formed soft watery
blood mucus present
ever undigested food fat stool
quantity character stool affected fasting certain foods
color stool rarely helpful diagnostically unless melena present stools acholic
next inquire medications might cause diarrhea antacids laxatives antibiotics colchicine
recent travel history possible exposure tainted foods diarrheal illness family sexual history also important
ask associated symptoms related gastrointestinal tract e g abdominal pain cramping nausea vomiting rectal urgency incontinence bloating increased flatus jaundice constitutional symptoms e g fever chills malaise anorexia weight loss
finally review systems may point important related involvement serve clue diagnosis example arthritis skin rash associated inflammatory bowel disease anxiety associated irritable bowel disease
understand better causes diarrhea treat one must first understanding normal digestive system
approximately liters ingested daily normal diet
time food material reached proximal duodenum another liters digestive secretions stomach liver pancreas intestine salivary glands added
chyme passed along small intestine osmolality adjusted distal ileum bowel contents isotonic plasma total liters
colon absorbs much remaining fluid leaving approximately cc slightly hypertonic stool excreted
colon capacity absorb liters per day normally one excretory patterns prevent complete desiccation bowel movement
diarrhea results alteration normal physiologic process digestion absorption
multiple causes diarrhea may multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms single disease entity
nonetheless following pathophysiologic classification provides useful framework approaching diarrhea
diarrhea secondary altered mucosal transport secretory dysfunction osmotic diarrhea diarrhea secondary malabsorption exudative diarrhea diarrhea secondary altered bowel motility
along small bowel absorption secretion fluid electrolytes occur normally net absorption
diarrhea result either decreased absorption increased secretion occurs
classic secretory diarrhea caused commonly toxins produced various bacterial pathogens staphylococcus escherichia coli vibrio cholerae
certain hormones produced excess vasoactive intestinal peptide vip gastrin produced pancreatic tumors calcitonin produced medullary cancer thyroid also stimulate excessive mucosal secretion leading diarrhea
case cholera vip tumors loss net absorption across intestinal mucosa thought mediated increased concentration certain mucosal cell cyclic nucleotides
experimental evidence suggests elevated levels cyclic amp stimulate net anion secretion thus causing diarrhea
secretory diarrhea occurs independent dietary intake subside fasting
addition significant stool osmotic gap defined
words stool osmolality determined solely measurable electrolytes nonabsorbed solute found osmotic diarrhea discussed next
osmotic diarrhea results presence osmotically active poorly absorbed solutes bowel lumen inhibit normal water electrolyte absorption
certain laxatives lactulose citrate magnesia maldigestion certain food substances milk common causes osmotic diarrhea
increased osmotic load measured stool
type diarrhea ceases fasting
numerous pathologic conditions including pancreatic insufficiency biliary disease crohn disease intestinal lymphangiectasia celiac disease cause malabsorption
several malabsorption syndromes one pathophysiologic mechanism responsible diarrhea making simple classification system difficult
nonetheless general points made
increase stool volume secondary fatty acid malabsorption results directly presence large quantities unabsorbed fat stool e
steatorrhea
excluding modifying fat intake form diarrhea often resolves
bile salts malabsorbed occurs disease terminal ileum deconjugated colonic bacteria bile acids directly stimulate colonic mucosal secretion causing diarrhea
malabsorption diarrhea also occur result direct loss absorptive surface either surgical resection bowel atrophy small bowel villous border seen celiac disease
enteroenteric fistula present may occur crohn disease whole sections intestinal absorptive surface bypassed
diseases associated large quantities inflammatory exudate blood pus proteinaceous material produce diarrhea
inflammatory products cause increased stool volume frequency altered absorption fluid electrolytes also plays important role
mucosal inflammation occur diverticulitis inflammatory bowel disease invasive enteric infections shigella salmonella campylobacter
etiology inflammatory response ulcerative colitis crohn disease remains poorly understood
intestinal transport delayed small bowel scleroderma blind loop syndromes resultant bowel stasis encourages bacterial overgrowth subsequent bile salt deconjugation
diarrhea direct result fat malabsorption increased colonic secretion
contrast significant increases bowel motility deliver excessively large volumes stool colon
diarrhea result maximum colonic absorptive capacity liters day exceeded
also alteration colonic motility bowel contents emptied adequate absorption occur offered possible explanation diarrhea associated irritable bowel disease
diarrhea common complaint outpatients infrequently problem among hospitalized patients
careful history physical examination differential diagnosis must formulated realistic decisions regarding evaluation treatment made
one must always certain miss acute abdominal process ischemic colitis
clinically useful divide diarrhea acute versus chronic illness
acute diarrhea primarily caused infectious agents toxins drugs
viral gastroenteritis one common causes
norwalk agent parvovirus rotaviruses viral agents isolated frequently
evidence suggest pathologic alteration small bowel mucosa adversely affects absorption luminal contents
toxins produced bacteria also frequent causes acute diarrhea
staphylococcal food poisoning prime example
etiologic agent preformed toxin illness characterized abrupt onset nausea vomiting diarrhea
contrast clostridium perfringens infection onset diarrhea delayed production responsible toxin requires bacterial replication
bacillus cereus produces two toxins preformed one causes illness similar staphylococcal food poisoning one like seen c
perfringens infections
presence blood mucus diarrhea along systemic symptoms fever chills abdominal pain suggests infection invasive organism shigella salmonella campylobacter yersinia
symptoms related mucosal damage irritation
fecal leukocytes commonly seen stool smear
food history may provide clue infectious agent
example b cereus associated ingestion fried rice vibrio parahemolyticus shellfish yersinia milk salmonella poultry
similarly travel history important
enterotoxigenic e
coli isolated travelers mexico central south american countries
giardiasis shown endemic leningrad remote areas western united states
emporiatric infections thought related contaminated water used either drinking washing foods
homosexual men predisposed enteric infections associated diarrheathe called gay bowel syndrome
entamoeba histolytica giardia cryptosporidia campylobacter shigella chlamydia herpes cytomegalovirus infections described patients
indeed infections may harbingers acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids
certain medications particularly antibiotics cause clostridium difficile enterocolitis pseudomembranous colitis
occur several weeks antibiotic therapy
multiple antibiotics implicated syndrome ones frequently identified clindamycin cephalosporins ampicillin
inflammatory bowel disease crohn disease ulcerative colitis also cause acute diarrhea associated systemic symptoms illnesses often associated chronic diarrhea
chronic recurrent diarrhea diarrhea usually persisted beyond days
observation often rules many infectious toxigenic diarrheas listed usually self limited readily treated
infections giardiasis amebiasis however may difficult diagnose may present chronic diarrhea
number humorally mediated chronic diarrheal syndromes deserve mention although rare
hormones produced autonomously functioning tumors cause chronic voluminous secretory diarrhea
diarrhea characterized persistence fasting state normal stool osmotic gap
gastrin vasoactive intestinal peptide vip isolated islet cell tumors pancreas
patients zollinger ellison syndrome gastrinoma hypergastrinemia produces diarrhea overwhelming bowel gastric secretions well acid inactivation pancreatic enzymes
pancreatic cholera wdha watery diarrhea hypokalemia achlorhydria syndrome results production vip appears activate intestinal adenylate cyclase stimulates excessive secretions resultant diarrhea
hypokalemia hypercalcemia metabolic acidosis common sequelae
secretory diarrhea also associated hormones increased secretion serotonin carcinoid calcitonin medullary thyroid carcinoma fully identified substance produced tumors sympathetic nervous system
addition stimulating intestinal secretion serotonin also increases bowel motility contributes diarrhea associated malignant carcinoid syndrome
patients hyperthyroidism also increased bowel motility diarrhea uncommon presenting complaint
multiple causes chronic recurrent diarrhea
history physical examination crucial diagnosis often invasive studies needed order make diagnosis
often helpful determine whether patient small large volumes stool
patients voluminous diarrhea often disease upper intestinal tractusually secondary either osmotic secretory process
patients small volume diarrhea often disease left colon rectum often inflammatory process
probably common cause intermittent small volume chronic diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome always diagnosis exclusion
patients often report alternating diarrhea constipation associated abdominal distention relief obtained defecation
note usually normal hour stool volume despite increased frequency bowel movements
cause irritable bowel syndrome unknown although investigators believe related altered colonic motility
another cause intermittent chronic diarrhea laxative abuse
one common causes diarrhea patients diagnosis remained elusive despite extensive evaluation
indeed cases diagnosis made search patient room
drugs cause chronic diarrhea include quinidine colchicine sorbitol cytotoxic agents
chronic diarrhea also associated diseases affecting absorptive surfaces bowel celiac disease radiation enteritis bowel ischemia inflammatory bowel disease
celiac disease characterized direct loss villous border intestinal mucosa resultant malabsorption
radiation treatment abdominal pelvic malignancies bowel ischemia inevitably produces mucosal damage cause chronic diarrhea
crohn disease ulcerative colitis inflammatory exudate contributes diarrhea malabsorption inflammatory involvement absorptive surfaces sometimes important factor well
processes affect absorption include specific enzyme deficiencies
pancreatic insufficiency impaired lipolysis secondary deficiency lipase result severe steatorrhea diarrhea
one common enzyme deficiencies lactase deficiency found commonly blacks asians american indians small percentage northern europeans
enzyme breaks nonabsorbable lactose sugar found milk dairy products readily absorbable glucose galactose
absence enzyme colonic bacteria metabolize lactose produce great quantities gas
patients complain abdominal bloating cramping well diarrhea
symptoms resolve lactose rich foods avoided lactose predigested ingestion
colonic polyps tumors may present diarrhea either abnormal secretory function may occur villous adenomas partial obstruction
partial obstruction results diarrhea overflow liquid stool around obstruction
stool impaction elderly patient may cause partial obstruction resultant overflow incontinence well
finally patients often complain diarrhea problem abnormality anal sphincter tone
patients often incontinent fact stool volume normal
