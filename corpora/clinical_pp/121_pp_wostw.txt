tinnitus sensation noise ear head apparent source noise evident
tinnitus may either subjective perceived patient objective perceived examiner also
virtually tinnitus subjective tinnitus idiopathic
unfortunately tinnitus one common disorders known
american tinnitus association reports million americans distressing symptom
identify associated disorder history exceedingly important certain reversible problems e g recurrent exposure loud noise drugs producing tinnitus e g aspirin quinidine barotrauma scuba diving renal disease ototoxic drug exposure lymphoma treatment involving ototoxic drugs may discovered
examiner must quickly run list various groupings disorders
include otologic dental orthodontic traumatic metabolic neurologic pharmacologic psychiatric table
patient questioned duration intensity quality pitch pulsatile nature fluctuation sleep effects resolution noise
determination made exact location
sound one ears elsewhere head extend neck eye face temple
careful review history may indicate excessive noise exposure head injury exposure ototoxic drugs
less cases however definite association noted subjective tinnitus
throbbing sensation ear head may indicate objective tinnitus
patient may mention lying supine rotating head pressing neck either exacerbate eliminate noise
persons hear objective tinnitus either holding ear close patient head double stethoscope
sometimes correctable cause objective tinnitus glomus tumor aneurysm found
rarely however cause amenable medical surgical treatment identified subjective tinnitus cases
authorities believe tinnitus represents loss damper mechanism human beings possess normally
mechanism may operative bundle rasmussen set efferent fibers running reticular formation brainstem final endings hair cells cochlea
parkinsonism represents loss control basal ganglia perhaps tinnitus represents loss eighth nerve suppression areas brainstem midbrain
patients die tinnitus little clinico pathological information exists
ubiquitous nature disorder indicates vital need long term prospective studies premortem postmortem documentation pathological changes
comprehensive study patients tinnitus carried kresge hearing research laboratory tinnitus clinic university oregon health sciences center
age distribution age age age
oldest patient youngest
young seemed congenital problems
older patients mostly noise induced tinnitus
sex ratio male female
patients study experienced tinnitus unilaterally majority bilaterally
normally two ears tinnitus pitch often loudness unequal
rare find pitch one ear differing
loudness may vary ears
patients localized tinnitus within head
localization head may due equal presentations ear may also due head injury
severity tinnitus correlate loudness reported patient
patients describe loudness tinnitus db
low considering normal conversation db
severity seems related factor loudness
patients fluctuating tinnitus may actually disappear times
correlated set pattern
university oregon patients tinnitus constant fluctuating
pitch tinnitus seems fit two broad categories tonal tinnitus noise tinnitus
pitch tonal type usually categorized noise type
patients tonal tinnitus present noise type tinnitus seemed combination
patients classified hz
low tone tinnitus hz hz
tinnitus high pitched
individual cases impossible determine cause tinnitus
head injury identified university oregon cases
tinnitus head injury seems fluctuate widely
residual inhibition absence sound may occur allows freedom tinnitus period time
comments refer patients idiopathic subjective tinnitus
natural history objective tinnitus follows course tumor aneurysm vascular abnormality caused noise
identifying causes amenable treatment tinnitus end idiopathic
perhaps objective demonstrate one possible causes listed table
effective treatment may possible objective types glomus jugulare tumors anomalous middle ear vessels aneurysms vascular anomalies around temporal bone
otologic consultation complete audiometry needed patients chronic tinnitus months duration
tinnitus shorter duration sudden onset obvious related disorder viral infection noise exposure usually ascertained
virtually cases sudden tinnitus associated symptoms hearing loss pain headache fullness ear vertigo nasal congestion otorrhea nystagmus hyperacusis
reader referred topics dealing management related symptoms
tinnitus seldom solitary symptom
