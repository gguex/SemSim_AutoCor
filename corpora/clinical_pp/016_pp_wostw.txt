arterial pulse abrupt expansion artery resulting sudden ejection blood aorta transmission throughout arterial system

complex factors affect contour arterial pulse transmitted arterial system careful examination central arterial pulse carotid necessary pulse contour information
although carotid pulse important much learned examination pulses bilaterally subclavian brachial femoral popliteal posterior tibial dorsalis pedis
palpation peripheral arteries performed whenever close enough skin surface compressed
auscultation arteries especially carotid subclavian femoral reveal bruits suggesting partial obstruction
pulse rate rhythm quality examined
addition patency pliability artery assessed
peripheral pulse contour determined left ventricular ejection vascular properties emphasis placed presence absence pulse hypokinetic hyperkinetic pulses
absence pulse could suggest occlusion thrombus embolus dissection
absence diminished leg pulses may confirm vascular etiology intermittent claudication
pulse present low volume amplitude hypokinetic
could suggest low cardiac output shock myocardial infarction
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy valvular stenosis pericardial tamponade constrictive pericarditis also cause low cardiac output small peripheral pulses
severe aortic stenosis causes small pulse known pulsus parous et tardus
low amplitude pulse delayed upstroke figure
best palpated carotid artery
contrast low amplitude arterial pulses large amplitude strong pulses normal
become bounding called hyperkinetic
anxiety exercise fever hyperthyroidism anemia cause hyperkinetic pulse normal person large left ventricular stroke volume otherwise normal cardiovascular system
hyperkinetic pulses also occur rapid peripheral runoff blood addition large stroke volume left ventricle
patent ductus arteriosus normal pulmonary pressures large arterial venous fistulas severe aortic regurgitation cause hyperkinetic pulses

occurs aortic stenosis accompanies severe aortic regurgitation
two waves called percussion wave followed tidal waveboth systole figure
bisferiens pulse strongly associated idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis
addition twice beating systolic pulses bisferiens twice beating bifid pulses one impulse occurs systole one occurs diastole
seen peripheral resistance diastolic blood pressure low
low cardiac output states allow systolic diastolic pulses become nearly equal potentially palpable see figures

balloon timed expand closure aortic valve
balloon evacuated collapses left ventricular ejection
figure note lower diastolic pressure left ventricle faces pump pulse
pump pulse diastolic pressure significantly higher systolic pressure generated left ventricle patient may hypovolemic
another abnormal pulse called pulsus alternans
regular pulse alternation beat amplitude every beat
associated severe left ventricular failure cause
amplitude changes emphasized peripheral artery may easiest detect femoral pulse figure
pulse decreases dramatically amplitude inspiration increases expiration called pulsus paradoxus
actually exaggeration normal physiologic phenomenon
inspiration pooling blood lungs transient decline venous return left ventricle
therefore left ventricular stroke volume declines slightly
fall systolic blood pressure greater mm hg abnormal figure
commonly associated pericardial tamponade cause decreased venous return left ventricle cause pulsus paradoxus
pericardial tamponade restricts right heart filling superior vena cava syndrome
addition asthma emphysema airway obstruction cause changes intrathoracic pressure effect wide swings pulmonary blood volume thus left ventricular venous return
pulsus paradoxus result
