lists abnormalities may discovered musculoskeletal system
abnormalities detected musculoskeletal examination several questions examiner keep mind collecting recording data
problem local one many areas involved
problem symmetrical
functional abnormality due
defect forces acting joint
defect fulcrum joint
systemic manifestations e g rash fever
examining musculoskeletal system important keep concept function mind
note gross abnormalities mechanical function beginning initial introduction patient
continue observe problems throughout interview examination
screening examination patient musculoskeletal complaints gross abnormalities noted interview general physical examination adequate inspect extremities trunk observable abnormalities ask patient perform complete active range motion joint set joints
patient presents complaints musculoskeletal system abnormality observed important thorough musculoskeletal examination delineate extent gross abnormalities also look closely subtle anomalies
perform examination muscles bones joints use classic techniques inspection palpation manipulation
start dividing musculoskeletal system functional parts
practice examiner establish order approach beginner perhaps better begin distally upper extremity working proximally shoulder
beginning temporomandibular joint pass cervical spine thoracic spine lumbar sacral spine sacroiliac joints
finally lower extremity begin distally foot proceed proximally hip
use opposite side comparisons easier spot subtle differences well identify symmetrical problems
question use anatomy control
glean maximum information observation
concentrating one area time inspect area discoloration e g ecchymoses redness soft tissue swelling bony enlargement wasting deformity abnormal angulation subluxation
noting changes attempt determine whether limited joint whether involve surrounding structures e g tendons muscles bursae
observe patient eyes palpating joints surrounding structures
patient expression pain depends many factors
reason verbalization pain often correlate directly magnitude pain
objective indicator magnitude tenderness produced presence palpation involuntary muscle movements eyes
therefore examiner observe patient eyes palpating joints surrounding structures
practice examiner become skilled evaluating magnitude pain produced examination able skillful evaluation without producing excessive discomfort patient
note areas tenderness pressure possible identify anatomic structures tenderness localized
one also note areas enlargement palpating joints surrounding structures
noting carefully consistency enlargement boundaries one decide whether due bony widening thickening synovial lining joint soft tissue swelling structure surrounding joint effusion joint capsule nodule formation might located tendon sheath subcutaneous tissue structures joint
palpating joints note areas increased warmth heat
method help even inexperienced perceive subtle increases heat choose heat sensitive portion hand usually dorsum fingers beginning proximally lightly pass part hand portions patient extremity several times
proceed proximal distal skin temperature gradually cools
find area becoming slightly warmer represents increased heat
patient perform active movements entire range motion joint
defects function rapidly perceived patient perform active functions region musculoskeletal system
reduces examination time helps examiner identify areas poor function careful evaluation
