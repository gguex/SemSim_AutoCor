new automated counters coefficient variation normal range thus reproducible microscopic method
coefficient variation increases counts less mm making critical examine peripheral smear count range perform manual count therapeutic decision made based count
normal ratio platelets red blood cells peripheral smear approximately thus high power microscopic field normally contains platelets
one platelet per high power field seen platelet count usually mm level consistent high probability spontaneous bleeding
unusually large small sized platelets increase error inherent automated instruments
underestimates particularly seen using electronic particle counters prefixed thresholds patients immune thrombocytopenia myeloproliferative disorders certain inherited disorders bernard soulier syndrome

platelet aggregation usually due poor collection techniques platelet satellitism leukocytes ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta collected blood frequent cause count underestimation
therefore essential screen blood smears verify platelet count patients

platelet coagulant activity produced primarily platelet factor ultimately plasma clotting factors leads formation fibrin clot final step coagulation sequence
megakaryocytes constitute less
marrow cell population go defined stages development platelets produced
megakaryoblasts compact lobed nuclei thin rim basophilic cytoplasm range mm size
polyploidization endomitosis n ploidy stage takes place cell
promegakaryocyte azurophilic granules begin seen nucleus becomes horseshoe shaped
next stage development granular megakaryocyte characterized multilobed nucleus pink cytoplasm size mm large numbers granules
final stage development mature megakaryocyte characterized liberation platelets sinusoidal spaces
megakaryocyte produces platelets circulate average days limited synthetic capacity
platelet production appears mediated soluble factors two levels
first acts stem cell level second maturing megakaryocytes
possible grow megakaryocytes vitro either blood bone marrow progenitors called cfu mega colony forming unit megakaryocyte
assays appear require megacsf specific colony stimulating factor obtained sera plasma patients aplastic anemia supernatant media phytohemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes
increased production mediator population progenitor cells stimulated divide resulting production megakaryocytes
however role platelet production
acute thrombocytopenia size megakaryocytes ploidy number increase mediated second stimulatory agent named thrombopoietin
molecule limited spectrum activity acting maturing megakaryocytes stimulate production colony formation vitro
addition thrombocytosis decreases thrombopoietin concentration cause complete inhibition marrow megakaryocyte progenitors
thrombocytopenia due either decreased marrow production increased peripheral utilization increased splenic sequestration
often multiple causes disseminated intravascular coagulation dic may nonimmune destruction well inhibition marrow production
various etiologies shown table
bone marrow biopsy necessary document decreased production count mm
marrow aspirate smears helpful adequate megakaryocytes seen decreased numbers may seen diluted specimens need verified biopsy
common causes decreased marrow production platelets drugs infections either primary secondary marrow malignancies
generally nonspecific toxic effect inciting agent cases thrombocytopenia accompanied anemia leukopenia
secondary drug withdrawal drug leads slow count recovery take month longer
contrast rapid recovery several days weeks drug induced mechanism increased peripheral destruction
thrombocytopenia associated shortened platelet survival usually due antibody mediated process may secondary drugs quinidine common neoplasms usually lymphoid connective tissue disorders lupus idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura itp
drugs quinidine act haptens bind plasma protein elicit production igg antiplatelet antibody
antibody coated platelet removed reticuloendothelial system
drugs form drug antibody complexes adsorbed nonspecifically platelet surface removed system
acute itp characterized rapid onset severe thrombocytopenia usually child antecedent viral infection cases

etiology presumably due immune complexes viral antigen antibody absorbed onto platelet surface removed system
chronic itp characteristically seen females years characterized elevated platelet bound igg patients
serum antiplatelet antibodies seen patients
spleen produces autoantibody main site platelet sequestration
since igg mediated process igg crosses placenta pregnant women itp risk delivering thrombocytopenic babies
steady state one third platelet mass exists freely exchangeable pool spleen
thus hypersplenism usually basis chronic liver disease thrombocytopenia due increased pooling spleen usually accompanied increased marrow megakaryocytes
thrombocytopenia characteristically mild presence healthy marrow
shown table causes thrombocytosis primary secondary marrow overproduction transient effect decreased sequestration seen splenectomy
thrombocytosis defined count mm symptoms rare count less mm
common cause count mm myeloproliferative disorder although counts high sometimes seen following splenectomy especially done itp
thrombocytosis seen splenectomy nonhematologic diseases usually resolves months cause symptoms
seen secondary causes thrombocytosis elevated counts associated myeloproliferative disorders often accompanied increased bleeding tendencies
functional abnormalities seen platelets measured abnormal bleeding times abnormal platelet aggregation vitro abnormal platelet factor release
variety acquired disorders associated qualitative platelet disorders usually causing bleeding diathesis
uremia causes complicated picture abnormal platelet aggregation abnormal levels platelet factor abnormal platelet retention glass beads none consistent
bleeding uncommon however abnormalities reversible dialysis
liver disease dysproteinemias acute leukemia many drugs cause similar abnormalities
aspirin common cause qualitative platelet abnormality
acts inhibiting cyclooxygenase preventing production thromboxane necessary platelet aggregation secretion
prostaglandin inhibitors ibuprofen indomethacin phenylbutazone also inhibit platelet aggregation unlike aspirin binds platelets irreversibly effects agents occur presence active drugs
variety inherited disorders associated qualitative platelet function defects bleeding tendencies
bernard soulier syndrome decreased platelet adherence subendothelial multimers viii von willebrand factor
glanzmann thrombasthenia absent abnormal surface glycoproteins lead impaired platelet aggregation adp fibrinogen
platelets appear important pathophysiology atherosclerosis
seem initiate disorder spontaneously attach intact epithelium
may however adhere endothelial surfaces damaged possibly hypertension smoking andor abnormal dietary lipids binding exposed collagen subendothelium
binding cause platelet aggregation initiate platelet release reaction release platelet driven growth factor
ultimately smooth muscle proliferation lipid accumulation result characteristic features atherosclerosis
disordered blood flow locally around focal lesions leads platelet aggregation release adp thromboxane serotonin ultimately lead complete thrombosis andor spasm narrowed blood vessels
approach thrombocytopenia depends etiology
examination peripheral smear provide verification low count well platelet size
addition looking signs bleeding physical examination spleen palpated evaluate possible sequestration
bone marrow examination generally recommended particularly thrombocytopenia severe treatment decision made
disorders decreased marrow production platelet size normal smaller marrow shows decreased megakaryocytes
disorders increased peripheral destruction normal increased platelet size increased megakaryocytes
evidence peripheral destruction found clotting tests done evaluate consumptive coagulopathy
bleeding due thrombocytopenia related two factors absolute count rapidity decline
risk significant bleeding increases dramatically count mm risk spontaneous cns hemorrhage increases dramatically counts mm
bleeding usually takes form petechiae skin usually lower extremities bleeding oral nasal mucus membranes less commonly bladder
less frequent potentially significant risk retinal hemorrhages may first sign bleeding seem occur frequently severely anemic patients
hemorrhages usually seen near disc often present blind spot also affect macula severely impeding vision
infection fever general increase risk bleeding thrombocytopenic patient counts mm
significant bleeding occurs count mm etiologies coagulation abnormality vascular defect investigated spontaneous bleeding thrombocytopenia alone counts uncommon
platelet counts mm range patients itp often associated bleeding platelets younger larger normal enhanced hemostatic effect
platelet transfusions usually random donors treatment choice prophylaxis treatment bleeding due thrombocytopenia decreased marrow production
number platelets obtained unit blood transferred nonalloimmunized patient raise count approximately mm
half life transfused platelets ideal conditions normal endogenous platelets days
customary transfuse patients empirically decreased marrow production platelets usually drug induced units random donor platelets whenever count drops mm
available data suggest prophylactic therapy associated enhanced survival leukemic patients compared transfused bleeding
would disagree prophylactic platelet transfusions counts mm increased risk fatal cns bleeding may reasonable observe inpatients closely without prophylactic transfusions counts transfuse bleeding conditions associated increased risk bleeding abrupt fall counts sepsis
prudent minimize transfusions platelets risk non non b hepatitis high receiving many transfusions many developing chronic liver disease
minimum one half patients acute leukemia receive repeated platelet transfusions ultimately become alloimmunized random donor platelets
lymphocytotoxic antibodies hla antigens may mark refractoriness determination valuable previously transfused patients future transfusions expected
test positive single donor platelets family members hla matched platelets necessary procure thrombocytopenic episodes
another alternative plateletpherese patient periods count normal cryopreserve platelets
matched platelets available alloimmunized bleeding patient transfusion random donor units usually effective temporarily stopping bleeding
patients itp dic even healthy marrow also given platelets severe bleeding episodes
epsilon aminocaproic acid doses approximately g per day divided doses occasionally value prophylaxis thrombocytopenic patients alloimmunized
therapy however quite expensive
therapy recommended children acute itp short duration corticosteroids initial prednisone dose mgkg per day initial therapy patients chronic itp
beneficial effect usually begins within first days
therapeutic effect e count seen patients usually weeks therapy started
higher prednisone dose

steroids appear work variety ways
reduce phagocytosis antibody coated platelets system may actually inhibit binding antibody platelet increase catabolism igg may depress autoantibody production
beneficial effect seen steroids continued full doses month gradually tapered months
count mm range maintained less mg prednisone per day splenectomy recommended
splenectomy causes rise platelet count usually first days approximately patients
unlike autoimmune hemolytic anemia radioisotopic studies value determining patients benefit splenectomy
patients refractory steroids splenectomy immunosuppressive therapy azothioprine value one third months therapy needed determine beneficial effect
high dose intravenous gamma globulin dosage mgkgday days increases platelet count soon hours patients itp
felt temporarily block system phagocytosing antibody coated platelets
effect usually lasts month less may permit safe splenectomy surgical procedures patients steroids either contraindicated ineffective
high cost transient effect used routine therapy newly diagnosed patient
patients secondary thrombocytosis usually develop symptoms
myeloproliferative disorder may develop signs symptoms thrombosis ischemia may affect peripheral vasculature cns
therapy directed reducing platelet production inhibiting platelet aggregation microvasculature
precise therapy varies depending disorder hydroxyurea oral alkylating agents usually effective decreasing platelet production
aspirin dosage mgday often given well
life threatening cases plateletpheresis reduce count rapidly
extreme care must taken assure normal blood pressure procedure hypotension may potentiate risk acute vascular occlusion
