weight change adults requires evaluation potential secondary causes loss gain total body weight attributed purposeful alterations diet activity
data however specify exact weight change clinically significant
weight loss considerably indicative underlying pathology weight gain
example minimum loss body weight less months represents potentially serious symptom
loss gain approaches body weight morbidity mortality rise rapidly regardless cause
weight loss gain society major financial medical implications witnessed plethora popular diets relationship weight change health disease
thus patient often volunteers information area presents frequently complaints weight gain rather loss
initially open ended question patient asked describe weight change circumstances surrounding
important subsequent details usual weight present weight time course weight change changes appetite
patient sure crucial components often helpful ask change dress belt size weights memorable events graduation marriage military service vacation times
instances relatives friends may need questioned expand confirm areas uncertainty
weight change established percentage change previous body weight well ideal body weight recorded along time span
subsequent questions ascertain predominant body location weight change
example primary changes body fluid often first noticed periphery
information changes body fluid tissue mass also obtained thorough nutritional assessment
dietary questions need specific number kinds meals recently routinely consumed information obtained patient possible individual usually prepares meals
also important snacks alcohol consumption socioeconomic environment
elderly handicapped inability obtain properly refrigerate cook food may major contributors malnutrition
additional symptoms relating weight loss gain potential underlying diseases shown tables
symptoms focused discriminatory lessen need comprehensive history
patient weight loss decreased intake nausea increase probability finding underlying cause
contrast patient weight gain increased intake usually associated underlying disease
either case appetite changes pursued detail e g change appetite similar meal
change meal preparation
ability smell taste food changed
patients weight loss found harbor disease compared less weight gain
loss gain weight may represent different pathophysiologic processes even occur disease
example diabetic patients may gain weight increased intake lose weight impaired metabolism absorption increased urinary calorie losses
patients weight loss clinical characteristics conveniently categorized four predominant mechanisms decreased intake decreased absorption increased metabolic requirements andor increased loss nutrients
patients decreased intake frequently greater decrease protein calories due expense neglect protein high biologic value animal protein diet
carbohydrates consumed associated insulin levels lead diminished lipid amino acid utilization well diminished availability visceral protein synthesis
example lack methionine lipoprotein precursor may lead impaired fat mobilization fatty infiltration liver hepatomegaly
protein availability diminishes muscle atrophy begins usually becomes apparent temporalis medial thigh areas
without essential amino acids fatigue pellagra like dermatitis andor dry depigmented skin brittle hair may develop
deficiency advances albumin hematocrit transferrin levels fall
decreased albumin results lowering oncotic pressure peripheral edema ascites hypotension may occur
patients reduced intake protein nutrients carbohydrates fats many physiologic clinical correlates protein deficiency become much less apparent e hepatomegaly ascites rare
appropriate energy adaptation weight loss protein calorie malnutrition results part reduction insulin secretion decreased insulin secretion allows lipolysis gluconeogenesis occur
processes accentuated glucagon cortisol growth hormone stimulation
muscle protein synthesis curtailed general metabolism reduced decrease production triiodothyronine thyroxine along decrease receptors catecholamines
overall improved utilization fat protein protein calorie malnutrition opposed protein deficiency results relatively higher albumin level greater
gmdl
consequently edema found unless protein calorie malnutrition severe
clinical signs indicate contraction lean body mass adipose tissue diminution subcutaneous fat triceps deltoid skin fold areas
skin becomes dry baggy vital signs may become lower normal decrease skeletal muscle mass
protein protein calorie malnutrition tissue loss results reduction intracellular nitrogen potassium magnesium phosphorus well reduction extracellular sodium chloride
also exchange intracellular muscle potassium magnesium plasma sodium potassium magnesium move cell excreted kidney
setting clinical signs weakness tremor polyuria cardiac arrhythmias may result decreased potassium magnesium
protein deficiency sodium extracellular fluid may increase result accompanying hypoalbuminemia secondary aldosteronism also vitamin deficiency may manifest ocular lesions night blindness xerosis conjunctiva cornea
vitamin deficiencies variable carefully sought
patients decreased absorption nutrients small intestine usually underlying disease leads predominant reduction lipids
reduction protein protein calorie nutrients carbohydrates fats occurs clinical manifestations weight loss similar described
malabsorption nutrient may result defects luminal mucosal secretory phases food absorption
example predominant fat malabsorption may due decreased lipolysis micellar formation luminal phase decreased esterification chylomicron formation mucosal phase andor decreased lipoprotein secretion lymphatic transport secretory phase
clinical manifestation defects usually includes steatorrhea stool may contain unabsorbed dietary fatty acids bile acids
patients often complain excessively large quantity sticky stools
unabsorbed fatty acids colon converted intestinal bacteria hydroxy fatty acids stimulate excessive electrolyte fluid secretion
result diarrhea poor skin turgor hypotension often concomitant loss bicarbonate metabolic acidosis compensatory hyperpnea
clinical manifestations may result loss lipid soluble vitamins e k well b folate
patients may dermatitis osteopenia bleeding anemia peripheral neuropathy
major nutrient losses carbohydrates may occur conversion colon osmotically active fatty acids resultant diarrhea
protein losses setting produce clinical characteristics seen protein malnutrition
patients increased metabolic requirements may need large calorie expenditure due demands increased motor activity increased metabolic rate
molecular mechanisms responsible associated weight loss well understood probably due variety hormone effects multiple metabolic pathways
example thyroid hormone increases tissue sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase atpase activity resulting excess synthesis atpase concomitant loss heat energy
thyroid hormone also increases beta adrenergic receptor sensitivity catecholamines
since metabolic regulation also neural control activation sympathetic nervous system results increased circulating levels catecholamines glucagon impaired insulin secretion
clinical signs catecholamine excess self protective acutely may chronically become self destructive diaphoresis tachycardia hypertension
patients also develop diarrhea lose nutrients stool
patients increased loss nutrients may present clinical picture characteristic particular nutrient deficiency
example loss blood urinary loss proteins may result signs described decreased intake protein losses
losses electrolytes calories diarrhea may result signs described malabsorption
many diseases multiple mechanisms operative therefore symptoms signs laboratory parameters must synthesized carefully
patient weight gain unlikely underlying organic disease
disease present clinical characteristics usually result two mechanisms increased intake andor decreased output e fluid retention
patients increased intake usually manifest physical signs similar primary exogenous obesity
metabolic changes may include hyperinsulinemia reduction fat muscle cell sensitivity insulin decreased receptors decreased glucose tolerance increase glucocorticoid production metabolism
overall physical signs tend relate premorbid condition
example patients previously underweight normal weight adult onset obesity generally add mass central regions trunk whereas patients lifelong obesity tend peripheral well central adiposity
exceptions finding occur central obesity cushing syndrome superimposed fluid retention occurs extremities
patients decreased output proportion intake especially fluid superimposed gains losses lean body tissue mass
normal plasma oncotic pressure decrease fluid excretion renal insufficiency often results positive balance extracellular fluid sodium chloride weight gain
increase may lead cardiovascular overload edema hepatomegaly jugular venous distention right heart venous capacitance exceeded
fluid increases also result cardiomegaly hypertension pulmonary effusions capacity left heart arterial impedance exceeded
setting atrial ventricular gallops may heard either side heart
mixed right left heart physical signs common
differential diagnosis weight loss gain shown tables
although diseases always compartmentalized pathophysiologic mechanisms occasionally overlap often necessary initially formulate broad based differential diagnosis
decreased intake may occur due inability obtain ingest food
inability obtain adequate protein protein caloric nutrition significant problem especially third world countries
kwashiorkor marasmus respectively end result
hospitalized patients also high prevalence kwashiorkor like syndrome
estimated patients given prolonged infusions intravenous saline dextrose without regard amino acid supplementation develop protein deficiency syndrome
setting unusual albumin levels drop within days hospital admission depending degree catabolism associated surgery fever secondary diseases
malignancy common disease producing weight loss
weight loss usually result anorexia
although pancreatic carcinoma classically associated major weight loss ideal body weight tumor common may first present silent jaundice abdominal pain
pulmonary gastrointestinal malignancies common tumors associated weight loss anorexia
chronic debilitating disease may affect intake decreased appetite inability prepare food
obstruction andor pain associated eating may also limit intake patients peptic ulcer neoplastic growth invades compresses stomach intestine
although granulomatous infections tuberculosis cause weight loss usually evidence systemic disease fever
endocrine disorders panhypopituitarism addison disease associated anorexia presumably due cortisol deficiency
finally neuroendocrine abnormalities may result drugs central nervous system disease
although abnormalities relatively rare marked weight loss adolescents young adults due anorexia nervosa bulimia syndromes appears increasing
presenting complaints often include irregular absent menstruation constipation cold intolerance
physical laboratory abnormalities often attributed protein calorie electrolyte malnutrition hypokalemia may life threatening
multiple abnormalities seen malabsorption syndromes
decreased absorption may occur single multiple nutrient deficiency depending site intestinal malfunction
consequently symptoms signs tend variable
fat malabsorption traditional symptom soft greasy malodorous stool floats may may present
many patients complain vague abdominal pain borborygmi andor abdominal distention normal stools one large bulky stool per day
floating stools result increased air stool rather fat
although specific diseases stomach small intestine gallbladder pancreas typical clinical characteristics early disease unimpressive except nonspecific intermittent abdominal distention
example giardia lamblia may parasitize small intestine remain asymptomatic produce severe symptoms
contrast diseases rarely clinical manifestations malabsorption without signs symptoms
example diabetic patients autonomic neuropathy usually also orthostatic hypotension impotence hypohidrosis
multiple mechanisms may operative endocrine disorders hyperthyroidism
patients increased metabolic rate fat malabsorption rare
infrequently patients gained weight hyperthyroidism example least adolescents gain weight hyperthyroidism lose weight
elderly patient typical symptoms signs increased thyroid activity may blunted absent apathetic hyperthyroidism
predominant complaints often weight loss fatigue suggesting malignancy
patients pheochromocytoma may also present weight loss related increased metabolic demand
causes increased metabolic demand surgery fever mania usually evident complete history physical examination
diarrhea occurs hyperthyroidism weight loss may exacerbated
patient surgically abbreviated small intestine development exacerbation diarrhea may worsen severity nutrient loss albumin reduced may net loss oncotic force gain rather loss weight
diseases diabetes mellitus fluid calorie losses occur osmotic diuretic effect hyperglycemia catabolic effect hypoinsulinemia net gain fluid calories may occur however exogenous insulin administration required renal insufficiency supervenes
weight gain may caused increased intake decreased output e fluid retention
increased intake often due increased appetite
central nervous system cns disorders however may rarely cause major gain weight via effects hypothalamus neurotransmitter systems
absence symptoms headache visual field disturbances extensive cns evaluation weight gain warranted
patients endocrine disorders hypothyroidism cushing syndrome generally demonstrate clinical features addition weight gain
fluid retention frequent cause weight gain
medicines nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs commonly missed cause fluid retention
excess antidiuretic hormone generally apparent hyponatremia detected less frequent cause
advanced congestive heart failure cirrhosis myxedema usually clinically apparent causes nephrosis may clinically occult urinalysis
rare disorders nutrient accumulation e g lipodystrophies may attributed accumulations fat may may apparent history
although clinical characteristics causes weight loss gain protean number potential laboratory investigations considerable complete history physical examination directed laboratory evaluation efficacious cost effective
screening hemogram urinalysis chemistry profile electrolytes glucose renal liver function tests albumin sufficient evaluation etiology complications patients isolated weight gain
patients weight loss chest roentgenogram added respiratory symptoms increased risk pulmonary malignancy
elderly patient weight loss apathetic hyperthyroidism potentially correctable cause excluded obtaining levels free thyroxine total triiodothyronine
