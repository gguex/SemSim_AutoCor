hematochezia passage fresh blood per anus usually stools
hematemesis melena hematochezia symptoms acute gastrointestinal bleeding
bleeding brings patient physician potential emergency must considered seriousness evaluated
goals managing major acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage treat hypovolemia restoring blood volume normal make diagnosis bleeding site underlying cause treat cause bleeding definitively possible
history directed toward confirming presence bleeding estimating amount rapidity identifying source potential specific causes eliciting presence serious associated diseases might adversely affect outcome table
information obtained especially helpful identifying situations require aggressive management
patient acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage seeks physician help hematemesis melena hematochezia symptoms hypovolemia fainting lightheadedness
patient may bleeding profusely need immediate treatment directed rather open ended questions appropriate
examiner ask patient vomiting occurred blood clots present emesis vomitus looked brown like coffee grounds indicating probable presence blood
bloody appearance readily identified hematemesis coffee ground appearance recognized without direct questioning
hematemesis indicates bleeding upper gastrointestinal tract usually esophagus stomach proximal duodenum
occasionally hemoptysis vomiting swallowed blood epistaxis confused hematemesis
careful history usually resolves confusion
hemoptysis associated coughing bright foamy red color
patient profuse epistaxis almost invariably aware nosebleed occurred
direct question stools black bloody
used active bleeding may occurring
make patient understand mean jet black comparing stool color black object
melenic stools also stickiness patient often remembers
substances iron bismuth turn stool black
melenic stool usually means upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage whereas hematochezia usually colonic source
slow intestinal transit occurs melenic stools may due bleeding sites distal cecum
rapid upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage often arterial site peptic ulcer may cause hematochezia
brief history suggests acute bleeding confirm presence bleeding testing stool gastric contents
nothing however impede immediate treatment hypovolemia
usual patient seeks physician help reasons gastrointestinal bleeding
situation extent allowed efficient use time open ended questions bowel movements like
experienced change bowel movements
preferable
important follow direct question ever black bloody stool
similar sequence elicit hematemesis might vomited past year
answer yes ask look like
bloody
brown look like coffee grounds
direct questions best approach hematochezia
asking bowel habits ask observed blood stools toilet paper
sometimes bleed rectum without passing stool
confirmation bleeding necessary resuscitation patient proceeding examiner estimate amount rapidity bleeding
ask patient number bloody stools passed times vomited frequency amount blood passed
encourage estimate terms common measures teaspoon tablespoon cup
physician must understand answers questions possibly reassuring predict amount rapidity hemorrhage yet occur
symptoms hypovolemia indicate major hemorrhage already occurred
combination hematemesis melena red hematemesis alone also suggests major hemorrhage
hematochezia although may massive usually presents minor bleeding important may come rectal colonic neoplasm
direct questions regarding frequency amount duration hematochezia allow examiner determine whether patient major life threatening hemorrhage acute chronic minor bleeding
patient treated history continued determine source potential causes
melena strongly suggests hematemesis confirms bleeding upper gastrointestinal origin
situation seek historical evidence common causes peptic ulcer cirrhosis esophageal gastric varices gastritis esophagitis mallory weiss tears malignancy
peptic ulcer common cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage pursued questions epigastric distress relationship symptoms food intake past history peptic ulcer disease
patients liver disease may varices source bleeding
ask known varices cirrhosis alcoholism previous hepatitis
mallory weiss tear usually occurs retching vomiting often associated heavy alcohol ingestion
aspirin nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents also cause gastric mucosal injury predipose bleeding effect platelet function
drugs removed patient treatment regimen enhance healing prevent future episodes gastrointestinal hemorrhage
heavy alcohol intake severe burns extensive central nervous system injuries many serious illnesses predispose hemorrhage gastritis
patients bleeding esophagitis esophageal ulcers usually long history heartburn
weight loss anorexia suggest gastric cancer associated upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage although similar symptoms found patients peptic ulcer
hematochezia usually comes colonic site although blood rapidly transported upper gastrointestinal tract red passed
older patients massive lower intestinal hemorrhage frequently caused bleeding diverticulum arteriovenous malformation
diverticular bleeding arterial tends brisk whereas history repeated often smaller hemorrhages typical arteriovenous malformation
less common causes massive colonic hemorrhage include cancer ischemic colitis
history suggestive inflammatory bowel disease sought patients
minor rectal bleeding direct questions causes cancer neoplastic polyps inflammatory conditions hemorrhoids
helpful know whether blood mixed stool suggesting colonic lesion whether merely covers stool toilet paper suggesting hemorrhoids rectal lesion
symptoms may helpful include diarrhea change bowel habits abdominal pain systemic symptoms fever weight loss
children gastrointestinal hemorrhage merit special consideration
exsanguinating hemorrhage uncommon children
neonates bleeding usually subsides spontaneously
spurious cause bleeding first several days life vomiting blood swallowed birth
maternal source blood determined checking fetal hemoglobin present maternal blood
serious causes hematochezia neonate include necrotizing enterocolitis midgut volvulus
wide variety causes hemorrhage occur children grow older
causes relatively unique children intussusception meckel diverticulum juvenile polyps
history chronic inflammatory bowel disease also sought
diagnostic accuracy history gastrointestinal bleeding sufficiently low make appropriate tests indicated
risk missing serious treatable lesion high warrant dependence history physical examination diagnosis
increasing availability nonoperative interventions sclerosis varices coagulation bleeding lesions makes accurate diagnosis important management acute massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage
ask patient advanced malignancies diseases heart liver kidneys lungs presence substantially alter therapy affect outcome patient bleeding rapidly
previous present myocardial infarction congestive heart failure cirrhosis chronic obstructive lung disease renal failure markedly increase risk major gastrointestinal hemorrhage presence alter decision regarding early operation bleeding continues
age also important consideration deaths occur patients
underlying defect blood coagulation system also sought
bleeding tendency may unappreciated adverse factor patients gastrointestinal hemorrhage
patients must asked anticoagulant use
correction clotting disorder may important stopping hemorrhage
melena common presenting symptom major gastrointestinal hemorrhage
quantitatively important gastrointestinal bleeding episodes occur sites ligament treitz
melena usually means bleeding location
takes ml blood stomach turn stools black
one two liters blood administered orally cause bloody tarry stools days first stool usually appearing within hours ingestion
thus melenic stool indicative recent hemorrhage indicate presence rapidity bleeding time passage
administration blood small intestine cecum cause melena blood remains intestine long enough
makes hypothesis untenable melena caused effect gastric acid pepsin blood
although melena usually means upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage small intestine cecum studied cause bleeding found esophagus stomach duodenum
hematemesis confirms upper gastrointestinal location bleeding suggests hemorrhage large
one small study six patients hematemesis lost quarter red cell volume
size hematemesis gives indication extent hemorrhage
general vomiting red blood ominous
important complication hemorrhage circulatory impairment tissue hypoxemia
melena hematemesis hematochezia indicates potentially lethal situation may developing
loss blood volume usually readily tolerated compensated contraction large veins recruitment fluid extravascular sites
volume depletion becomes greater constriction arterioles shunting cardiac output nonvital areas skin bone tachycardia decreasing cardiac output orthostatic hypotension occur
patient likely thirsty feel faint standing
depletion blood volume complete loss ability compensate occurs shock impaired flow blood vital organs tissue hypoxemia lactic acidosis ultimately death
rapid correction blood volume essential
dogs irreversible changes occur within hours phlebotomy maintains reduction mm hg mean arterial pressure
earlier transfusion save animals
role many homeostatic mechanisms pathogenetic mediators response hypovolemic shock beginning elucidated
mediators include catecholamines renin complement kinins lysosomal enzymes
goal therapy protect link delivery oxygen cells restoring maintaining normal blood volume
convincing description hematemesis melena substantial amounts hematochezia indicates bleeding potential emergency handled situation assessed
important inference made history gastrointestinal hemorrhage
mortality acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage varies widely age presence absence serious associated diseases renal failure malignancy congestive heart failure cirrhosis
majority deaths occur patients age
older patients less able withstand massive hemorrhage surgical intervention
description acute hemorrhage trigger three management steps
first restore maintain normal blood volume
history suggesting active gastrointestinal hemorrhage alert physician immediate need treatment hypovolemia shock
next site cause bleeding established
becoming increasingly important methods using interventional endoscopy radiology developed stop hemorrhage
finally treatment regimen planned based diagnosis condition patient
regimen might include pharmacologic therapy reduce gastric acidity endoscopic coagulation bleeding ulcers sclerosis varices embolization bleeding vessels using angiography operation
regimen must also provide long term management underlying disease
causes gastrointestinal hemorrhage numerous tables
although may suggested details obtained history diagnostic tests required confirm clinical impression
passage nasogastric tube simple often neglected method demonstrating bleeding upper gastrointestinal
negative gastric aspirate exclude upper gastrointestinal source bleeding may stopped blood duodenum may entering stomach
esophagogastroduodenoscopy preferred method diagnosis upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage
development therapeutic endoscopic techniques aggressive stance favoring early endoscopy diagnosis patients makes sense
proctoscopy demonstrate bleeding hemorrhoids rectal lesions ulcerative colitis
active colonic bleeding frequently reach proctoscope makes colonoscopy difficult impeding view although modern methods bowel preparation partially overcome problem
either isotopic study using labeled erythrocytes angiography may helpful active colonic hemorrhage techniques limitations
angiography requires active substantial bleeding diagnostic
radioisotopic study intermittent bleeding allow positive test precise localization site difficult
colonoscopy used bleeding ceases
barium studies make subsequent angiography endoscopy difficult avoided
patients bled need attention long term management well medical emergency hemorrhage constitutes
optimal care requires development long term treatment plan maximizes wellness minimizes morbidity underlying disease
bleeding stop operation usually indicated
bleeding however stop stopped majority patients
point becomes important manage underlying disease aggressively
acid peptic disease treated prevent recurrences use prolonged pharmacologic therapy
controlled studies become available esophageal varices obliterated endoscopic sclerosis underlying liver disease treated lower portal pressure
shunt procedures rarely needed
precipitating causes analgesic use avoided
patient must educated bleeding early therapeutic intervention possible recurrence
