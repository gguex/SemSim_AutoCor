adolescent grows physically must also mature psychologically sexually socially cognitively
complex process dynamic interrelation among components well physical
nonphysical components also proceed along continuum development puberty
rarely proceed unison complete harmony
onset progression varies individual individual sexes
unlike physical development may regress well progress depending environmental stresses
global terms adolescent must emancipate himselfherself family accept adult body body image ability procreate sexuality develop adult identity self image attain skills required function society economically independent develop adult patterns thinking integrative cognitive function
necessary person effective adult fulfilling life
process typically onset early second decade life usually completed early adult years
critical components process depicted dynamic continuum interactive given point time table
although stages development arena assigned specific chronologic age may useful consider four stages development early middle late adolescence young adult
early adolescence characterized initial efforts establish independence family beginning sex peer relations questioning one identity separate family
developing independence family usually expresses reluctance refusal compliant participant family activities ascribe equal greater importance sex peer group activities
phase peer group increasingly influences adolescent perception acceptable behavior dress
typically adolescent behavior egocentric selfish body focused
quest personal identity usually begins questioning normal
part basis increasing concern changing body e secondary sexual development acne blemishes etc
ambivalence insecurity usually observable hallmarks
adolescent may one moment day shun family next seek security best friends individual peer group suddenly view enemy
adolescents time orientation predominantly existential thinking concrete operational e future abstract thought difficult impossible comprehend logical thinking usually limited single item information
example use transverse sagittal sections human body explain menstrual reproductive function typically effectively comprehended
adolescents health viewed simply absence disease blemishes
middle adolescence stage adolescent usually well established peer group desires conformity
mixed sex activities begin increase
teenager usually spends increasing time away family seeks independence
results overt challenges authority rules established patterns behavior
adolescents consider invulnerable times invincible
milieu experimentation drugs alcohol tobacco dress sexuality begin usually reach peak
addition teenagers become aggressive seeking increasing autonomy demanding privacy
time orientation continues primarily existential thinking begins move toward formal operational thought
begin thinking thinking may withdraw hours
philosophically tend idealistic standpoint identity begin ask
concern body image continues
ambivalence rapid fluctuations mood common punctuated hours days apparent depression
socially stage development adolescents remain primarily egocentric
although begin recognize around think feelings believe others contact made focused believe continually scrutinized others called imaginary audience
relation anticipatory health counseling important physician recognize adolescent parent conflicts well risk taking behaviors usually peak e typical time family school crises may accompanied physical signs symptoms
stage early adolescence teenager primarily sees externally controlled external locus control parents school peer group increasing perception personal responsibility typically begins emerge internal locus control late middle adolescence
late adolescence perhaps best characterized adolescent beginning response question relation around future
personal independence family formal operational thought continue advance teenager begins realistically consider issues future education vocation adult sexual commitment
consideration given thoughts feelings others including parents
less peer group activity commitment late adolescents developing two three close friends one typically opposite sex
time teenagers usually able extrapolate experimentation early middle adolescence related experiences different settings
sense invulnerability constant scrutiny others begins assume realistic proportions
internal locus control continues develop realize ability provoke others happiness sadness anger pleasure
less dependence body image greater emphasis sell image begin perceive internal external persons
time first begin perceive clearly physically moving away home family assuming increasing responsibility varying degrees economic separation sexual commitment work additional self motivated education training
begin experience uncertainty future
consequently common time separation anxiety become manifest form physical signs symptoms
youth process occurs smoothly usually time parents despite pains separation renew confidence capabilities offspring
young adult adult stage primarily takes place away family
individual identity becomes stabilized intimate personal sexual relationships based ability identify attempt understand thoughts feelings another
beginning defined role society begins emerge increasing sense personal responsibility worth continues develop
effective fulfilling independent function adult society signifies completion process
worth emphasizing progression along continuum psychologic sexual social cognitive development varies
onset rate progression component differs individual individual sexes
major component assessed physician caring adolescent since optimal patient management may positively negatively affected adolescent status regarding development one components
example teenage female may late adolescence regarding quest independence early middle adolescence regarding cognitive identity development
consequently may engage sexual intercourse may reluctant seek medical advice contraception venereal disease feels constant scrutiny comes contact little concept future believes pregnancy cant happen invulnerability
medicine physician ability establish effective relationship patient crucial
effective relationship begin physician must like teenagers comfortable interacting respect individuals willing relate non judgmental manner without nondirective
adolescent needs health care advocate surrogate parent buddy
general expects physician use understandable adult language latest teen jargon
author opinion physicians like cope effectively adolescents include practice
physician must establish teenager personal physician
beginning point establish limits confidentiality patient well parents guardian either time initial visit previously seen children defined age years old
statutes relating confidentiality teenagers vary state state ascertained physician
author opinion confidentiality relative
one effective statement conversations alone unless consider something danger others
instances although discuss behind back share information parents ask present
regarding diagnosis treatment required discuss wish shared parents whether us talk
clear statement regard provides basis mutually trusting relationship physician adolescent well physician parents
obvious corollary confidentiality patient must seen alone part history physical examination
author view patient seen alone history nongenital parts physical examination unless patient prefers someone else attendance
genital portion examination appropriate allow patient decide whether wishes parent friend chaperone present total privacy
finally physician relationship adolescent growth promoting wherein patient expected gradually assume increasing responsibility health care needs
generic components adolescent medical history adult specific attention immunization nutrition sexual social histories
sequencing interview important
parent accompanies patient seen alone assess perception patient problem obtain data regarding patient birth developmental past medical family histories
thereafter parents seen without patient unless patient desires
next patient seen alone remaining history physical examination
finally patient parents seen together discuss plans evaluation therapy required review patient health status evaluation therapy needed
history taken quiet private room
format open caring nonjudgmental friendly appear mechanistic interrogation
important remember physician says tends far less important adolescent initial interview said
initial focus getting know patient questions activities school interests hobbies may useful reducing patient anxiety first component formal information gathering reason visit chief complaint history surrounding history present illness
adolescent assumes primary reason also physician primary concern therefore may become suspicious confused physician focuses first area obvious relationship reason given visit
patient level cognitive development important consideration history taking optimal information obtained
example open ended complex direct questions asked adolescent whose thought primarily concrete operational often generate dont know huh
response
consequently author experience early middle adolescents effective efficient history gathering achieved using simple direct questions occasionally punctuated question requesting elaboration yes response teenager seems openly talking
critical components psychosocial history patient function home school peers
selected useful questions explore areas detailed table
general wise avoid generic type questions best friend friends school
question almost invariably given yes answer thus potentially masking underlying problem
yes response may mean teenager speaks peers hallway usually speak return thus information desired teenager peer group run around best friend talk
provided
revealing pertinent questions best friend name
names kids run around school
patient background behavior personality problems childhood puberty andor admits periodically depressed days time specific question suicide thoughts attempts warranted
adolescent admits thoughts suicide degree considered explored
example passing thought considered
rare fleeting thought suicide may represent serious problem adolescent arid requires careful attention cases psychiatric referral
questions relating sexual history tailored developmental stage sex adolescent
primary areas assess dating petting intercourse pregnancy prevention condom use satisfaction current sexual activity masturbation venereal disease homosexual concerns activity
appropriate initial question male girlfriend
answer unlikely intercourse
answer yes effective follow date
often date
date alone
yes sexually involved girlfriend
yes intercourse
yes prevent getting pregnant
use condom
satisfied relationship sexual experience
similar questions used assess female patient sexual history
nutrition history often deferred abbreviated gathering adolescent database
age group important times crucial component
adolescent nutritionally vulnerable greater demand energy calories quality protein minerals vitamins rapid phase physical growth almost invariably change eating habits lifestyle irregular meals snacking junk food eating dieting puberty may additional nutrient demands adolescent participates sports pregnant etc
furthermore important concern request adolescent gain lose weight seriously considered physician inappropriate fad diets may lead overnutrition interrupted avoided
example physician take seriously desire apparently normal weight adolescent lose kg athlete wishes gain weight
failure may former result diet provides inadequate nutrition latter use anabolic steroids
since eating disorders increasing frequency today youth particularly females patient eating habits carefully explored potential signs anorexia nervosa bulimia overeating
key features successful adolescent interview summarized table
finally often revealing conclude interview asking areas concern discussed
physical examination often provokes significant anxiety adolescents
consequently important properly prepare teenager examination communicate patient findings interpretation
former accomplished reviewing adolescent done physical examination immediately following interview still dressed
example physician state male patient next use first person third since adolescent may confused apprehensive means need physical examination
going examine area problem well eyes ears nose throat neck chest breasts stomach arms legs penis testicles
examination room nurse tell put examination gown removed clothes
anyone comes back room knock used assure ready
questions
adolescent privacy autonomy important issues
females males basically modest
consequently important provide examination gown covers trunk genital area
examination adolescent feeling control simply effectively enhanced uncover area needs exposed examination
talking adolescent examination also tends increase comfort however conversation appropriate area examined e dont discuss weather examining breasts genitals discuss area examined
key features adolescent physical examination summarized table
stage development selected problems likely occur table
physical examination interview first component examined area suggested reason visit even though may differ physician usual sequence complete physical examination
since adolescent concerned body growth development normality important identify acne blemishes deformities inquire adolescent concern
area appears normal secondary sexual development appropriate age important inform adolescent since may ask de novo
simple process often relieves tension allays fear opens way adolescent ask questions would otherwise verbalized
key components adolescent physical examination include accurate height without shoes weight preferably examination gown sitting supine blood pressure staging genitals male breasts female pubic hair breasts male possible gynecomastia back scoliosis particularly females dorsal kyphosis skin acne hyperkeratosis hyperhidrosis females hirsutism teeth obvious dental pathology visual activity hearing
patient height weight recorded longitudinal nchs velocity tanner whitehouse growth chart along available prior values
provides effective method assessing patient growth rate per year establishes usual growth percentile
height weight normally progressives continuously childhood puberty deceleration nadir ph v pwv year
distinct plateauing linear growth weight gain unexplained weight loss kg alert physician possible underlying disease need close observation andor evaluation
adolescent stage secondary sexual development also carefully recorded testes breasts pubic hair
distinctly early delayed onset andor rapid slow progression may result hypothalamic pituitary gonad disease abnormal genetic composition turner kleinfelter syndrome etc underlying often occult organic disease hypothyroidism inflammatory bowel disease primarily crohn renal tubular acidosis etc
although absolute criteria recognizing abnormal height weight gain secondary sexual development puberty guidelines shown table
proven clinically useful
rectal examination males required suspicion prostate bowel disease unexplained anemia homosexual activity
latter instance rectal culture gonorrhea obtained
female pelvic examination required suspicion disease abnormal secondary sexual development pregnancy patient mother received des pregnancy contraception requested patient sexually active
examination performed baseline pap smear culture gonorrhea obtained
baseline laboratory data adolescent include hemoglobin hematocrit urinalysis cholesterol hemoglobin electrophoresis blacks well rubella titer females
since hemoglobinhematocrit values increase progressively males secondary sexual development minimally females important interpret values according stage development
example hematocrit normal male female stage prepubertal compared stage male female
adolescents use drugs alcohol also baseline liver function tests
since alkaline phosphatase ap rises normal adult values puberty must interpreted conjunction stage development
ap levels begin rise onset puberty peak time ph v males females usually decline normal range time adolescent reached stage
peak values may high three times upper normal adult values
best therapy disease prevention early treatment
consequently anticipatory health care counseling early detection routine providing comprehensive health care adolescent
