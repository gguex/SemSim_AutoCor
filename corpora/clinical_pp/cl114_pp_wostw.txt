external eye structures include eyelids surrounding tissues conjunctiva lacrimal apparatus cornea anterior chamber
astute clinician frequently gain helpful diagnostic information patient briefly meticulously studying external eyes
eyes small organs helps get close patient order see fine details
compare one eye unilateral eye pathology much easily recognized comparison made normal structures side
study carefully prominence eyes
also note whether opening lids symmetrical
observe margin eyelids mucus pus discharge scales lumps
lids fit smoothly eyeball
conjunctiva eyeball equally white eyes
conjunctiva lining inner eyelid lower lid may inspected gently pulling lid finger
conjunctiva lining upper lid observed everting upper lid shown figure
lacrimal apparatus checked observing excess dryness tearing
gently pressing lacrimal sac medial corner lower lid nose normally express discharge
cornea anterior chamber best examined using pocket flashlight
cornea lustrous surface crystal clear allowing crisp lucid view iris
scratch cornea readily demonstrated applying fluorescein strip observing blue light
many systemic diseases manifestations observable external eye examination
metabolic diseases hyperthyroidism cause changes tissues surrounding eye altering appearance function
changes autonomic nervous system alter position eyelids
abnormal lipids may deposited lids abnormal heavy metal deposits may deposited specific ring near edge cornea
lacrimal apparatus produces tears drains eye abnormalities may produce either tearing dry eye
rheumatoid arthritis collagen diseases may decrease tear mucus production causing eyes become dry
organs may localized bacterial viral fungus infections lids conjunctiva cornea anterior chamber
foreign bodies ocular trauma usually produce sudden striking signs symptoms external eye
tissues surrounding eyes easily distended systemic edema suggesting cardiac renal failure
bulging protrusion eyes called exophthalmos classic sign hyperthyroidism
may may lid signs hyperthyroidism well retraction upper lids giving patient wide eyed staring appearance
another lid sign thyroid disease lid lag upper lid follow eyeball exactly eye looks
drooping eyelid called ptosis suggests third nerve paralysis homer syndrome myasthenia gravis may congenital
lid margins subject localized bacterial infections called stye hordeolum
common lesions reveal classic redness swelling tenderness pus discharge localized pyogenic infection
definite lump lid without signs acute inflammation likely chalazion cystlike accumulation secretions lid margin
tumors lid margin uncommon occur
discrete waxy yellowish deposit medial aspect lid xanthelasma suggesting possibility abnormal blood lipids figure
lid sags outward touch eyeball ectropion
lid turns inward allowing lashes scratch eye called entropion
sometimes lid margins red irritated covered scales
condition called blepharitis usually associated seborrhea scalp
conjunctiva white eye sensitive indicator many ocular diseases
may discolored yellow jaundice bright red conjunctival hemorrhage
spontaneous conjunctival hemorrhage associated ocular disease trauma necessarily imply systemic disease
elevated yellow plaque nasal margin cornea benign lesion called pingueculae lesion location fine surface vessels grow onto cornea called pterygium
usually removed unless encroach upon visual axis
conjunctiva turns red response many types inflammation
commonly bacterial infections rarely viral fungal infections may cause red eye
small piece grit may become embedded conjunctiva lining upper lower lid
scratches cornea produces severe pain especially eyes blink removal gives rapid relief
contact lenses ocular trauma may also scratch cornea making eye red painful
diffuse redness conjunctiva also caused diseases within eye example intraocular inflammation uveitis increased intraocular pressure glaucoma
lacrimal apparatus help conjunctiva produces tears lubricate eye
rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus scleroderma may cause decreased tear production dry eye
lacrimal drainage apparatus may become obstructed infected anatomically unable drain tears producing chronically tearing eye
cornea normally crystal clear
defect corneal epithelium however small abnormal
may white cloudlike opacities old inflammation trauma fine radial white lines representing inactive blood vessels growing margins toward centerthese suggest ghost vessels previous syphilis infection
systemic diseases may leave deposits margin cornea
fine peripheral circular line usually green tint may deposited wilson disease
diffuse haze murky appearance cornea may indicate diffuse corneal edema intraocular inflammation
