nail infolding skin occurs terminal end digit creating four specialized components proximal nail fold matrix nail bed hyponychium figure
epidermis component may form modified horny material site undersurface proximal nail fold forms cuticle matrix forms hard nail plate
whitish crescent shaped lunula portion matrix seen transparent nail plate proximal pink nail bed
nails protect terminal phalanges assist grasping minute objects
examination nail systematic manner unlike systematic examination cardiovascular system
heart proper position examination patient right side proper sequence examination beginning upper right sternal border sequentially moving apex
location inspection palpation auscultation performed
systematic examination nail equally imperative
nail digit held observer hand nail closest observation
component nail examined sequentially pausing location detection abnormalities color shape
step examine nail folds abnormalities color shape
step examine lunula abnormalities color shape

examining component nail system realize delicate interaction vascular melanocytic regenerative structures easily disturbed change body normal homeostasis
change produce characteristic pattern disruption
swelling paronychia vascular changes collagen vascular disease easily appreciated nail fold dermis thinned

specialized vascular system responsible pink color nail bed
deciding whether change present plate bed difficult
example muehrcke lines edema pushing overlying nail plate away nail bed characteristic white transverse bands pallor may confused mees lines
three simple tests help distinguish nail bed process nail plate process
first examination nail time reveal bed process grow plate
second nail bed processes generally less opaque plate processes
third pressure distal plate blanche bed vasculature sometimes alter appearance neighboring nail bed process
nail every digit must examined systematic manner
clue diagnosing patient fever unknown origin may lie splinter hemorrhage found one nail
systematic examination understanding patterns disturbance aid diagnosis disorders
nail assists grasping small objects functions protective covering end digit
hard nail plate made flattened cells closely apposed interlocking plasma membranes keratin high content cystine disulfide bonds
plate transparent due absence nuclei within cells
nail plate proximal half moon lunula distal nail bed seen
lunula distalmost part matrix seen
matrix appears white due thickened epidermis region light scattering effect nucleated cells
epidermis nail bed thinner vascular therefore clinically pinker
epidermis dermis nail bed oriented ridges parallel direction nail growth
ridge contains fine capillaries disrupted lead small splinter hemorrhage fills neighboring valley
epidermis nail bed contributes small amount keratin underside nail plate
allows nail plate adhere underlying nail bed glide smoothly grows
fingernails grow faster toenails
thumbnail grows rate approximately
mm per day
toenails grow one third one half fast
nail plate may thin incorporate pigment retain clinically white nucleated cells systemic disease
examples multiple ways nail used record past events
nail fold telangiectasia present number disorders

bywaters lesions characterized small painless reddish brown infarcts nail fold figure may darken fall leaving tiny pitlike depression
vasculitis especially rheumatologic produces lesions
paronychia swelling inflammation proximal lateral nail folds acute chronic
acute paronychia represents abscess cellulitis usually preceded traumatic event
chronic paronychia usually related moisture
onset vague may cause matrix abnormalities leading beau lines usually associated absent cuticle creating excellent entry site candida
warts common tumor nail fold

smooth linear periungual angiofibromas koenen tumors seen patients tuberous sclerosis
skin malignancies also found nail fold
normally white lunula may become blue wilson disease argyria
lunula may become red cardiac failure carbon monoxide poisoning
lunula normally increases size fingers closest thumb however lunula becomes smaller absent old age

proximal pallorous nail bed congested blood manually occluding venous outflow band must still easily distinguishable
terry nails normally occur older patients suspicion cirrhosis chronic congestive heart failure adult onset diabetes mellitus raised younger patients
vascular telangiectasias distal nail bed produce color change
brown distal band occupying approximately nail bed termed lindsay nail half half nail associated chronic renal failure figure
abnormal melanin pigment may responsible disorder

splinter hemorrhages important diagnostic sign
vascular nail bed organized parallel longitudinal dermal ridges oriented along axis nail growth
blood vessels ridges disrupted small amount hemorrhage fills valley two ridges giving characteristic appearance splinter
splinter hemorrhages commonly associated light trauma however associated fever cardiac murmur bacterial endocarditis must suspected
cirrhosis vasculitis scurvy also produce splinter hemorrhage nails simultaneously affected trichinosis becomes important consideration
carbon monoxide poisoning produces cherry red nail beds due bright red carboxyhemoglobin
polycythemia also produce red appearing nail bed anemia produces pallor
separation nail bed overlying plate creates white appearing proximal extension free air termed onycholysis
space may fill dirt accentuating change
exogenous endogenous systemic dermatologic disease etiologies considered
trauma maceration pseudomonas fungal infection chemicals nail cosmetics cause separation
photo induced onycholysis caused tetracycline derivatives oral contraceptives chlorpromazine
systemic endocrine causes onycholysis hypothyroidism thyrotoxicosis usually fourth finger pregnancy diabetes mellitus
