regardless whether obvious problem treat patient unknown order avoid missing endocrine disorder
patient one endocrine disease e g hashimoto thyroiditis greater risk development endocrine disorders e g adrenal testicular ovarian failure
patient may harbor one endocrinopathy could overlooked subtle historical clinical clues heeded
always allow patients express
ask patients feel let answer
often within first minutes history endocrine cause becomes apparent
find useful review patient complaints literally head toe
patient vocal pitch may give clue
hypogonadal male high pitched voice androgenized female may deeper voice expected
body fat distribution gives important clues presence adrenal steroid excess excessive wasting may imply adrenal steroid insufficiency hyperthyroidism
eunuchoid habitus suggests hypogonadism
observation skin color pattern wrinkling distribution skin pigment body hair yield useful historical clues
hair growth important piece information
ask patient often shaves frequency decreased
adult male presence absence facial hair frequency shaving give important information gonadal status example hypogonadal males primary klinefelter kallman syndrome secondary gonadal insufficiency atrophic testicles following trauma mumps autoimmune diseases etc
family history clue many families display sparse facial hair growth
females may complain excessive body hair lead investigate causes excessive androgens
pituitary gland investigated history physical radiographs
think hormones secreted pituitary appropriate questions asked
adrenocorticotrophic hormone acth controls glucocorticoid production
excess acth produces classic cushing appearance
mental changes fatigue muscle weakness easy bruising infections stretch marks acne findings related steroid excess
deficiency hormones produce complaints ranging fatigue apathy dizziness shock coma unexplained fever joint abdominal complaints
findings coupled hyperpigmentation would lead one suspect primary hypoadrenalism
absence hyperpigmentation would lead one suspect primary acth deficiency
chapter outlines tests endocrine function demonstrates one relate findings laboratory
follicle stimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh also reviewed chapter control testicular ovarian steroid synthesis
female appropriate sequence adenarche thelarche menarche obtained
amenorrhea important clue breakdown hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis
male sexual development function require normal hypothalamic testicular axis
history helps assure adequacy fsh lh testosterone
certainly male full beard fathered children recently primary hypogonadal process
presence normal erections adequate libido full beard normal male body habitus helps exclude hypogonadism without need extensive testing
growth hormone plays little role adult deficient
growth hormone excess produces acromegaly
history often reveals enlargement acral parts tightly fitting rings fingers increase shoe hat size
photographs often demonstrate marked changes appearance years
prolactin produce galactorrhea female patient
woman complains breast secretions deserves evaluation
presence menstrual periods galactorrhea often implies benign etiology amenorrheagalactorrhea elevated prolactin suggests pituitary tumor
thyroid disease also displays protean presenting manifestations
thyroid dysfunction mild unnoticed patient examiner
local effects thyroid gland enlargement may produce goiter
pain compression surrounding structures occur however
hyperthyroidism elderly may cause complaints lassitude fatigue weight loss constipation
younger patients often complain overactivity nervousness jitterness tremulousness intolerance extremes heat difficulty concentrating insomnia
symptoms may develop insidiously patient recognize specifically quizzed
hypothyroidism may present loss interest depression fatigue cool dry skin constipation mild degree weight gain simply difficulty losing weight
disorder progress point extreme overwhelming hypothermia coma death
presence enlarged thyroid gland useful assessing hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism
neck pain tenderness trouble swallowing important clues cause enlarged thyroid gland
severe tenderness heralded antecedent viral illness lead clinician think thyroiditis
chapter outlines detail history physical examination thyroid gland
diabetes chapter often presents insidiously gradual onset excessive thirst urination nocturnal frequency weight loss increased appetite
manifestations occur frequently type ii non insulin requiring adult onset diabetes
acute development symptoms occurs type insulin requiring diabetes
blurring vision frequent infections numb painful extremities nonhealing extremity ulcers important clues lead diabetic evaluation
chapters outline approach detail
careful questioning helpful pinpointing onset illness based upon clinical clues
chapter describes importance observing patient physique build
extremely short stature failure undergo pubertal growth spurt clues growth hormone deficiency
hypothyroidism plus hormone deficits often coexist
individuals disproportionately tall relation parents siblings complaints sexual difficulties gynecomastia may klinefelter another form gonadal disturbance
eunuchoid female habitus helps making assessment
symptoms diabetes mellitus chapter may fulminant illness characterized extreme thirst blurring vision nocturia
presentation common type insulin requiring diabetic opposed insidious complaints type ii diabetic
less commonly patient may present complaints end organ damage
swelling feet secondary urinary protein loss renal insufficiency neuropathic complaints numbness feet hands pain extremity dermatomal distribution body may occur together separately
vascular event leg cramps walking claudication ulcers extremities dramatically stroke coronary disease may initial finding
discussed previous paragraphs manifestations endocrine illnesses far reaching affect almost every organ system
comprehensive physical examination complement complete history mandatory
begin scalp progress downward
necessary instruments noted table
patient undressed observe body size habitus chapter
distribution body fat may reveal information nutrition thyroid adrenal status important clues presence cushing disease
combination supraclavicular fullness moon facies violaceous striae dorsal cervical fat pad centripetal truncal obesity often diagnostic
penguinoid habitus klinefelter patient often recognized first glance
scalp facial hair well balding pattern useful clues assessing patient gonadal status
decreased quantities facial hair perioral periorbital wrinkling may subtle signs hypogonadism
female excessive hair acne male pattern balding central scalp hair loss signs androgen excess
presence retinal changes characteristic diabetes range subtle vascular anomalies microaneurysms hemorrhages exudates retinal buckling detachment proliferative changes
optic atrophy manifested disk pallor suggests pituitary tumor mandates careful visual field examination
graves disease displays classic eye findings
hyperthyroid eyes may range redness protrusion extraocular muscle optic nerve dysfunction
thyroid gland chapter visible palpable
skilled examiner often visualize thyroid nodule outline diffusely enlarged gland
palpable characteristics gland may differentiate multinodular goiter hashimoto thyroiditis nontoxic goiter graves disease
thyroid morphology coupled clinical finding thyroid disease often suggests diagnosis prior return laboratory tests
presence galactorrhea lead one assess pituitary disturbances
gynecomastia male may important clinical significance ranging hypogonadism malignancy
male genital examination together peripheral manifestations gonadal disease may high diagnostic yield
one carefully inspect presence testicles within scrotum palpate size consistency
male female pubic hair patterns important
examination perineum may yield important information clitoromegaly labial urogenital abnormalities noted
careful inspection hands feet especially diabetics important
diabetic cheiropathy classic periarticular tightening suggests presence vascular disease organs portends high risk heart disease
shiny thin skin absence hair lower extremities absent pulses feet suggest presence macrovascular microvascular disease diabetes mellitus
examination neuromuscular system equal importance
absence ankle jerks vibratory sensation pinprick light touch abnormalities injoint position sense muscle atrophy diabetic indicates diabetic neuropathy
proximal muscle weakness common endocrine disorders hyperthyroidism cushing disease
entire endocrine history physical examination performed minute period
many cases diagnosis reasonable assurance made patient leaves examining room
