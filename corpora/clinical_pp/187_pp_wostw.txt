urinary tract infection may involve urinary tract level including renal parenchyma renal pelvis ureters bladder urethra
infections ureteropelvic junction upj termed upper tract infections upj termed lower tract
infection renal parenchyma termed pyelonephritis
patients significant urinary tract infection past aware diagnosis
questioner begin general queries ever kidney trouble kidney problems
ever told kidney bladder urinary tract infection
patient unable provide details spontaneously mention features urinary tract infection inquire whether patient experienced
ask whether patient voiding symptoms frequency urgency dysuria alone whether fever chills nausea vomiting general malaise flank pain present instead addition voiding symptoms
former group symptoms characteristic lower tract infection latter upper tract infection
next ask medical evaluation past infections
inquiries may provide valuable information severity type disease
ask whether intravenous pyelography ivp ultrasonography cystoscopy voiding cystourethrography performed
procedures may briefly described prompt patient recall done
unsophisticated patient may remember ivp recall x ray procedure dye caused flushing injected vein
patients forget cystoscopy
inquire associated risk factors urinary tract infections
chronic indwelling catheter drainage bladder due paraplegia trauma spina bifida self evident
others neurogenic bladder diabetic autonomic neuropathy bladder outlet obstruction due urethral valves prostatism urethral stricture analgesic abuse neuropathy papillary necrosis ureteral stricture recurrent renal colic inferred proper questioning
treatment pyelonephritis complicated urinary tract infection usually requires hospitalization parenteral antibiotic therapy
cystitis typically treated oral outpatient therapy
recurrent urinary tract infections may treated chronic suppressive regimens
thus questions relating type duration treatment also clarify nature previous urinary tract infection
determine whether infection isolated event whether recurrent
recurrent ask whether chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy prescribed whether urine cultures obtained asymptomatic intervals
infection urinary tract occurs two principal routes
bacteremia result seeding renal parenchyma
particularly likely individuals preexisting renal disease another type including chronic glomerulonephritis diabetic nephropathy chronic interstitial nephritis
infection may also occur ascending route spread urethra bladder upper tracts
latter common females much shorter distance urethral meatus bladder proximity meatus vagina rectum
manipulation urethral meatus introduce bacteria bladder urine cultures obtained women coitus show high rate positivity
manipulation urologic procedures cystoscopy catheterization also predispose lower tract infection ascending infections
prevalence bacterial colonization urinary tract patients bladder catheters place hours virtually
urologic manipulation obstructed partially obstructed urinary tract especially likely induce severe infection
severity urinary tract infection variable
cystitis important cause discomfort inconvenience life threatening seldom leads permanent damage urinary tract
treatment aimed alleviation symptoms
recurrent cystitis problem urinary suppression chronic antibiotic therapy may indicated
pyelonephritis lead permanent renal scarring dysfunction septicemia death
complications especially likely result obstruction pyohydronephrosis present
uncertain significance called asymptomatic bacteriuria positive urine cultures without symptoms
formerly believed manifestation chronic pyelonephritis could lead renal failure
absence underlying structural renal disease however asymptomatic bacteriuria probably cause progressive renal damage
quite difficult separate asymptomatic colonization upper tract lower tract
techniques bladder washout ureteral catheterization definitive invasive
testing voided bacteria coating antibodies often present tissue infection noninvasive neither adequately sensitive specific
important know whether urinary tract infection associated significant anatomic lesion
treatment remediable lesion may prevent episodes infection damage urinary tract obstruction caused lesion
cystitis common young women probably warrant anatomic investigation
evaluation repeated episodes low yield may indicated
lower tract infection rare males normal urinary tracts
like upper tract infections patient lower tract infection males investigated appropriate anatomic studies
patient past history nephrolithiasis stones may single multiple unilateral bilateral
may discovered incidental asymptomatic finding x ray passed spontaneously required urologic intervention removal
renal colic one severe forms pain patients difficulty recalling full blown episode colic
doubt effort made differentiate renal colic forms abdominal back pain may occasionally confused
except simultaneous passage bilateral stones renal colic unilateral
typically begins aching pain region costovertebral angle later becomes lancinating excruciating
stone descends ureter pain moving inferiorly anteriorly lower quadrant affected side finally radiating scrotum penis labia
pain persist given spot stone moves farther along ureter
pain commonly associated nausea diaphoresis
although residual aching may persist significant relief pain occurs passage stone beyond ureterovesical junction bladder
ask patient character duration pain
ask whether one episode colic several whether episodes unilateral bilateral
ask whether stones passed spontaneously whether urologic manipulation required
necessary manipulation involving cystoscopy ureteral catheterization snare ureteroscopy lithotripsy
ask whether open ureterolithotomy pyelolithotomy necessary
ask whether associated infection
ask whether cause nephrolithiasis determined
many patients know whether retrieved stone analyzed whether contained calcium whether infection stone
metabolic evaluation current nephrolithiasis requires extensive testing
patients know details recollection whether put relatively complicated work required
typically patients asked follow calcium restricted diet temporarily collect hour urine specimens
ask whether done
ask also treatment measures instituted since stone passage
regimens vary
patients asked increase fluid intake
others given specific instructions drinking least liters per day drinking two glasses water upon retiring middle night arise void measuring hour output periodically verify daily urine flow liters
inquire also specially prescribed diets including low calcium oxalate purine diets
ask also prescribed medications thiazide diuretics oral phosphate therapy
finally ask risk factors stone disease positive family history inflammatory bowel disease purine oxalate gluttony myeloproliferative disorders gout
vitamin preparations containing vitamin absorbable antacids containing calcium e g turns calcium carbonate preparations also pose risk stone formation
recall large amounts oxalate contained spinach rhubarb beet greens kinds nuts chocolate improperly brewed tea
ingestion large quantities vitamin c may also lead increase oxalate excretion although authorities agree
stones contain calcium varying combination oxalate phosphate apatite magnesium ammonium struvite
others formed uric acid cystine
stones form supersaturation urine one substrates
supersaturation occurs daily excretion abnormally high may also exist normal daily excretion rates urinary ph shifts lack urinary solubilizing agents
calcium present approximately stones
roughly oxalate apatite salts
frequently definable urinary abnormality documentable causes include excess calcium excretion excess oxalate excretion chronically alkaline ph urinary citrate deficiency seen renal tubular acidosis
ten percent stones contain apatite associated magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite
stones result infection urea splitting bacteria proteus
resulting high urinary ph favors precipitation struvite forming typical staghorn calculi infection
calcium nephrolithiasis associated hypercalciuria cases
hypercalciuria may occur increased filtered load calcium results hypercalcemia may accompany conditions hyperparathyroidism sarcoidosis
commonly occurs without hypercalcemia absorptive hypercalciuria renal hypercalciuria
former intestinal calcium absorption increased normal excess calcium appears urine
cases dihydroxyvitamin levels elevated stimulation intestinal calcium absorption vitamin presumed mechanism hyperabsorptive state
patients renal hypercalciuria defective renal tubular calcium reabsorption leading excessive excretion
two disorders may distinguished comparing urinary calcium excretion fasting state postprandial excretion
groups patients hypercalciuric calcium meals hypercalciuria persists fasting renal absorptive hypercalciurics
calcium oxalate poorly soluble excessive oxalate excretion readily leads calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis
occurs primary hyperoxaluria autosomal recessive disorder characterized defect glyoxylate pathway leads excessive oxalate production
hyperoxaluria also result ingestion oxalate rich foods see increased intestinal absorption oxalate
latter typically results inflammatory bowel disease involving terminal ileum
resultant fat malabsorption diminishes availability calcium complex oxalate gut allows presentation oxalate colon absorbable form
non calcium containing stones include cystine uric acid
cystine stones occur cystinuria autosomal recessive defect proximal tubule reabsorption dibasic amino acids
cystinuria accompanied increased excretion lysine ornithine arginine
even normal uric acid production urine supersaturated respect uric acid
urate stones may thus occur normouricosuric individuals
commonly urate nephrolithiasis associated hyperproduction hyperexcretion urate due myeloproliferative disorder purine gluttony
stones likely recur
many types stone disease treatable
thus history stone passage past prompt physician determine whether etiology sought specific therapy prescribed
evaluation undertaken
stones causes significant morbidity
renal colic agonizing patient wants recurrence
repeated episodes colic cause significant loss productive time
addition blockage ureter predisposes urinary tract infection
stone impaction procedures required alleviate may complicated ureteral stricture later produce obstructive uropathy
impossible eradicate infection stone matrix recurrent persistent stones serve nidus infection
case struvite stones infection favors stone formation initiating cycle lead formation staghorn calculi severe renal cortical scarring marked loss renal function sequelae
number renal diseases hereditary positive family history may significant
interviewer begin general questions follow specific questions history positive
lead inquiring whether anyone family kidney disease kidney trouble
determine whether disorder involved infection stone passage kidney failure hypertension proteinuria hematuria
patients ordinarily knowledge specific diagnosis glomerulonephritis often told excess protein urine
may recognize edema relative problems swelling relative taking diuretics water pills
ask affected relatives received dialysis e kidney machine treatments kidney transplants
polycystic renal disease common autosomal dominant inherited disorder leads end stage renal disease
affected families several members reached middle age likely receiving dialysis treatments
members previous generations persons developed end stage renal disease ready availability dialysis died renal failure
asymptomatic children affected family members may screened evidence disease
thus members families may quite sophisticated knowledge disorder
usually possible always appropriate construct family tree indicating family members affected
heritable disorders alport syndrome benign familial hematuria severity disease affected individuals much variable
families difficult establish pedigree
although many renal disorders heritable
positive family history always imply increased risk renal disease patient
number types familial renal disease
several forms cystic diseases heritable
adult polycystic disease autosomal dominant disorder penetrance
although may become manifest seventh eighth decade usually presents third fourth decade hypertension hematuria infection pain due bleeding cyst end stage renal disease develops ensuing ten years
childhood polycystic disease autosomal recessive disorder features similar adult form except end stage renal disease attained within first decade
nephronopthisis cystic renal medulla complex characterized corticomedullary medullary cysts interstitial fibrosis progressive renal failure
salt wasting may important clinical feature
although cases sporadic cases juvenile form characterized autosomal recessive inheritance
additional renal retinal dysplasia associated retinal disease
twenty percent cases present early adulthood adult variant form autosomal dominant inheritance
several forms heritable renal disease associated deafness
alport syndrome usually inherited autosomal dominant disorder although kindreds male male transmission occurred making preferential segregation sex linkage likely form transmission
clinical features disorder include microscopic gross hematuria proteinuria renal failure sensorineural deafness ophthalmic abnormalities
although males females equally likely affected renal disease greater severity likelihood progression end stage renal failure greater males
charcot marie tooth disease autosomal recessive disorder characterized proteinuria nephrotic syndrome peripheral neuropathy
muckle wells syndrome characterized autosomal dominant inheritance deafness amyloidosis renal involvement
another important heritable renal disorder renal tubular acidosis rta
type distal rta frequently associated hypercalciuria andor nephrolithiasis
type proximal rta commonly associated fanconi syndrome constellation proximal tubular disorders including aminoaciduria glycosuria hyperuricosuria phosphate wasting may lead renal rickets
either proximal distal rta cause growth retardation presents childhood
inheritance disorders isolated form usually autosomal dominant
may also occur association generalized autosomal recessive disorders

lists heritable diseases mentioned less common inherited renal disorders
knowledge family history renal disease important piece diagnostic information
family history well established need extensive diagnostic evaluation invasive procedures curtailed
renal biopsy probably necessary explain hematuria member family known carry alport syndrome
objective documentation carriage defective gene deemed necessary abnormal audiogram might well substitute renal biopsy
conversely lack family history also important diagnostically
renal ultrasound intravenous pyelogram individual several simple renal cysts may resemble individual early polycystic kidney disease
lack family history polycystic kidney disease strongly favor former diagnosis
addition information family history essential genetic counseling decide appropriateness screening potentially affected parents siblings children
