exercise capacity maximum amount physical exertion patient sustain
accurate assessment exercise capacity requires maximal exertion sufficiently prolonged stable steady state effect circulation pattern patient response consistent exertion repeated
assessment exercise capacity essential feature patient evaluation
complete accurate history often cornerstone assessment
history reflect detailed quantitative information intensity duration maximal effort specifics nature limiting symptoms
information clarify extent impact exertionally related problems may also valuable diagnostic prognostic implications
logical guide evaluation appropriate therapy
exercise capacity evaluated interview direct laboratory measurement
approaches important complementary
information patient history immediately available inexpensive
significantly information defines exercise capacity context patient symptoms lifestyle preferred mode activity
historical information contaminated unsuitable forms exercise patient anxiety might occur exercise laboratory
practice complete historical information patient activity useful planning exercise laboratory testing
interview patients encouraged specific possible describing observations relation one particular recent periods physical activity
several kinds information must elicited
maximal effort must defined terms intensity duration exertion
quantification intensity implies estimation rate performing physical work
example flight stairs may climbed run steady walk leisurely pace possibly interrupted frequent stops
thus exercise performance fully characterized total work output e g flights blocks rate e g brisk walk normal pace duration effort e g minutes
incidental information may also important particularly precipitation exertionally related symptoms
ambient temperature recent meals medications emotional state exert crucial influence circulatory response exercise consequently alter likelihood given intensity effort challenge cardiovascular reserves
perhaps important item historical information related effort character time course exercise induced symptoms particularly symptoms cause patient stop
specific symptoms discussed detail later section
general presence pattern effort limiting dyspnea chest discomfort light headedness generalized specific weakness palpitations leg cramping major distinctive implications patient management
exertional symptoms usually occur crescendo fashion threshold exercise intensity exceeded symptoms resolve minutes rest
one noteworthy exception walk angina
patients unusual condition angina fades even exercise persists probably initially excessive circulatory response exercise partially reverses continuing steady mild effort
symptoms appear immediate postexertional period
symptoms likely reflect greater awareness somatic sensation exercise ceases well rapid shifts hemodynamic autonomic function recovery period
response exercise induced symptoms appropriate therapy particularly prevention symptoms effort may much clinical utility
detailed accurate account exercise induced symptoms often reward interviewer remarkably precise indications relevant pathophysiology possibilities effective therapeutic intervention
ingenuity imagination may needed arrive reliable meaningful information exercise performance especially ordinarily sedentary patients
specific detailed inquiry made physically demanding common domestic activities e g carrying laundry groceries chasing wayward children pets yard work bed making floor washing job related tasks e g lifting stair climbing operating machinery sexual intercourse travel e g hauling luggage sports
right question sometimes elicit vivid accounts experiences effort might otherwise mentioned
order bracket maximal exercise capability one must define patient e g flight blocks normal pace well e g flights blocks
activity sustained minute likely yield reliable information circulation begin approach steady state time period
sustained activity may possible however severely symptomatic patients
consistency performance important one defining exercise capacity
consistency sought asking several different kinds activities
extent patient limitation equally evident several different contexts
certain patients however fluctuations inconsistencies exercise capacity
degree explained differences incidental conditioning factors mentioned previously differences character exertion e g arm work versus leg work untrained versus trained muscle groups isometric versus isotonic effort
discrepancies resolved one may compelled define range exercise capacity characterizes patient good days bad days
consistent shifts exercise capacity important sought patient exercise related problems
clear cut deterioration exercise capacitybest defined symptom induced inability perform activity could performed regularly without symptoms earlier dateis often convincing evidence clinically meaningful disease progression
although exercise capacity best defined terms maximal effort tolerance clinical context must delineated evaluating patient expectations demands respect physical activity
exercise capacity subjectively quite satisfactory relatively sedentary apartment dweller may severely debilitating patient physically demanding occupation avocation
important consideration expressed formerly commonly used means classifying cardiovascular symptoms table
practice objective subjective measures symptomatic limitation figure clinical decisions
newer canadian cardiovascular society classification stipulates inability perform specific task walking two blocks level climbing one flight ordinary stairs normal pace normal conditions objective index marked limitation anginal patients
function several body systems particularly circulation respiratory systems adequately tested exercise
system reserve capacity far excess needed sustain normal asymptomatic body functioning rest modest activity
many disease processes affecting circulation respiration cause progressive loss physiologic function
diseases likely manifest initially reduction cardiac pulmonary reserve
since reserve capacities tested exercise early potentially remediable stages diseases sort may produce symptoms strenuous effort
assessing maximum capability patients perform exercise examining physician evaluates least qualitative terms reserve capacity organ systems contributing exercise response
impairment exercise capacity alert physician potential need specific precise studies organ function
exercise performance reflects coordinated response cardiovascular pulmonary neural function along action exercising muscles
exercise induces graded increases heart rate arterial pressure cardiac output myocardial contractility rate depth respiration
rapid reversible shifts also occur distribution blood flow blood composition
changes orchestrated central nervous system responding direct cortical input neural humoral feedback exercising muscles
neural control cardiovascular function exerted part characteristic increases sympathetic stimulation reciprocal decreases para sympathetic stimulation
steady effort cardiovascular pulmonary parameters begin stabilize minutes rapid change levels appropriate specific intensity exercise particular patient
steady state levels used characterize patient performance
autonomic shifts may trigger pathologic well physiologic responses e g exercise induced arrhythmias asthma
reduced exercise capacity may indicate dysfunction portion complex exercise response
thus nonspecific symptom generalized weakness may reflect endocrine metabolic hematologic neuromuscular psychological problems well cardiovascular pulmonary disorders
since generalized weakness nonspecific particular underlying cause must identified associated clinical manifestations
exercise capacity many instances measured objectively testing patient exercise laboratory
although certain limitations testing great value selected patients
maximum exercise performance characterized respect intensity duration effort values associated limiting symptom compared estimates obtained history
performance index matched prior performance patient order quantify changes occurring time therapy
also matched performance patients order assess comparability patient groups
information especially useful physician patient historical information unreliable ambiguous
latter infrequently case patients fail push meaningful limits
exercise intensity measured external work e g watts total body oxygen consumption ml okgmin
exercise performed according generally accepted protocol workload escalation fixed intervals stage exercise termination provide summary estimate exercise capacity
general exercise testing like historical inquiry seeks define functional reserve measuring maximal symptom limited exercise capacity
exercise testing also utilize specific physiological end point age related target heart rate value associated full deployment functional reserve
addition objective quantification exercise capacity definition limiting symptoms laboratory testing demonstrate important concomitant changes physiological parameters heart rate blood pressure cardiac output left ventricular ejection fraction arterial blood gas content ventilatory characteristics
also reveal characterize electrocardiographic evidence myocardial ischemia arrhythmia
coincidence exercise induced symptoms specific physiologic derangements go long way toward identifying origin possibly remedy patient problem
history limited exercise capacity may important characterizing quantifying clinically significant problem
decreased exercise capacity stimulate search specific cause usually guided associated symptoms signs
control exercise induced symptoms major goal treatment many cardiovascular pulmonary disorders
thus complete accurate assessment extent limitation relation patient pattern activity often essential intelligent selection evaluation treatment program
aside quantifying exercise limitation impact lifestyle accurate estimate exercise capacity may also value establishing diagnosis prognosis
presence stable consistent limitation exercise implies static defect anatomy physiology
circumstances measurement cardiac pulmonary function onset symptoms often reveal characteristic changes
contrast dyspnea ischemic type chest pain occurring unpredictably associated impaired exercise capacity suggests much evanescent abnormality paroxysmal arrhythmia bronchospasm coronary spasm
prognostic implications reduced exercise capacity also significant
aortic valve disease particularly aortic stenosis heart related exercise limitation identifies patients high risk cardiac death
regardless lack interference lifestyle favorable symptomatic response medical therapy patients generally considered appropriate candidates operative intervention prevent cardiac death
somewhat analogous situation exists certain subgroups patients coronary artery disease
selected individuals marked impairment exercise capacity e g canadian cardiovascular society class iii iv suggests relatively high mortality likely improve coronary artery bypass procedure whereas better exercise capacity lower mortality lesser likelihood improved prognosis operation
hence assessment exercise capacity patients aortic valve disease coronary artery disease offers important clues long term outlook well optimal management
noteworthy however exercise capacity reliable guide prognosis cardiac patients
individuals dilated cardiomyopathy left ventricular ejection fraction much reliable predictor mortality
patients markedly reduced ejection fractions relatively preserved exercise capacity approximately equal risk early cardiac death patients similar ejection fractions impaired exercise capacity
detailed searching sympathetic discussion patient often yield much useful information patient exercise capacity
interviewer must aware however limitations approach
patient anxiety depression potent motivating factors lead unconscious denial distortion exaggeration exercise related symptoms
certain patients symptoms may present way character defined confidence
patients never perform tasks likely reveal meaningful information exercise capacity reasons directly linked disordered physiology
thus wise clinician seek corroborative data objective exercise testing
laboratory conditions appropriate patient practice symptoms appearing vague inconsistent atypical history often revealed distinct consistent typical reproduced course testing
correlative changes physical findings electrocardiographic findings hemo dynamic parameters also clarify origin character otherwise obscure problems
thus exercise laboratory viewed useful occasionally indispensable supplement interview assessment exercise capacity
patients unsuited exercise testing
testing inappropriate useful information likely emerge clinical situation fully defined findings exercise performance impaired extraneous factors
exercise testing particularly symptom limited testing contraindicated due safety considerations patients symptomatic critical aortic stenosis unstable angina recent myocardial infarction frequent malignant ventricular arrhythmia conditions might lead hemodynamic instability
