nerve controls tongue movements
nuclear infranuclear lesions produce paralysis atrophy fasciculations tongue involved side
supranuclear lesions produce mild moderate contralateral weakness may transient
bilateral supranuclear lesions seen pseudobulbar palsy produce moderate severe inability tongue function
start inspecting tongue rests patient mouth
unilateral weakness paralysis strongly suspected tongue curled gentle arabesque
tip tongue point normal side due unopposed normal tone half tongue
look atrophy fasciculations
test genioglossus asking patient protrude tongue
unilateral weakness paralysis tongue point affected side due unopposed action normal muscle
nuclei dorsal medial medulla
supranuclear innervation predominantly contralateral cortex descends corticobulbar tract
fibers leave medulla pass hypoglossal canal
peripherally nerve supplies intrinsic muscles tongue genioglossus tongue protrusion hypoglossus styloglossus
supranuclear lesions usually produce transient mild weakness contralateral side tongue
considerable individual variation however occasion supranuclear lesion produce appears nuclear lesion due degree weakness
transient nature usually clue
nuclear lesions produce atrophy weakness paralysis fasciculations
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis polio two causes
syringobulbia infarction intraspinal tumors etiologies
nuclear lesions often bilateral closeness two nuclei medulla
hypoglossal nerve involvement individual fibers exit medulla seen many lesions affect spinal accessory nerve see chapter
tumors compress nerve hypoglossal canal jugular foramen
basilar meningitis due granulomatous infection carcinoma produce hypoglossal lesions
unilateral twelfth nerve palsy reported one common cranial mononeuropathies due metastases
