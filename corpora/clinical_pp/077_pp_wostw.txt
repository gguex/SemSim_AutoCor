presents useful classification
clarify complaint sleep disturbance clinician become familiar broad categories sleep disorders within association sleep disorders centers detailed diagnostic classification sleep arousal disorders
clinical relevance diagnoses addressed first two divisions classification ordered according patient complaint insomnia excessive daytime sleepiness
historically exploring patient presenting sleep related complaints provides highest likelihood obtaining significant data underlying condition
sleep arousal disorders frequently encountered clinician disorders initiating maintaining sleep insomnias
patient complains trouble sleeping patient difficulty falling asleep
asleep patient able remain asleep desired length time
long patient sleep
patient perception quality sleep
since sleeping state waking state integral components hour continuum quality patient waking state equally relevant
patient feel upon awakening morning
function day
patient feel tired andor involuntarily fall asleep day
patients awaken refreshed function perfectly well despite sleeping much less expected
except brevity sleeping appears normal
called short sleepers regularly daily sleep total less usually expected age
apparently psychologically healthy patients complain insomnia objective studies fail reveal sleep pathology
despite falling asleep less minutes sleeping
hours patients convinced sleeping inadequate insomnia without objective findings
combination pseudoinsomniacs short sleepers constitutes patients complaining insomnia
others disturbed sleep may involve fundamental aspects sleep hygiene
patient regular time awakening
disturbing environmental factors
change lighting occur sleep
room temperature suitable patient particular sleeping needs
patient bed partner bothersome
tolerance environmental factors varies individual individual
attempting establish relationship environmental factor disturbed sleep clinician needs consider whether disturbance correlates temporally stimulus disturbing physically measured
second disturbing aspects stimulus arise physical properties rather emotional meaning patient
third least gradual return satisfactory sleep stimulus removed
patient nap day
naps may improve nighttime sleeping often interfere
particularly true elderly patients
duration sleep disturbance
information relevant differential diagnosis complaint management problem
disturbance recent origin prompt clinician seek precipitating causes
regard chronic insomnia common cause psychiatric disturbance
proper context sleep disturbance may constitute strong evidence diagnosis unipolar depression

answer often
psychiatric illnesses may associated different sleep symptoms
bipolar depression often associated sleeping excessive yet unrefreshing
patients manic phases often seem require little sleep
generally anxious patient may difficulty getting sleep restless sleep
sleep often disturbed psychotic conditions
seems direct correlation degree sleep disturbance severity psychiatric illness
even absence major psychiatric illness insomnia may begin emotionally arousing event
termed situational psychophysiological insomnia
sleep expected normalize emotional reaction event subsides
disturbance less weeks regarded transient
persistent psychophysiological insomnia usually history prestress sleeping fair best
added burden excessive stress leads deterioration sleep accompanying deleterious effect daytime functioning
increased efforts obtain sleep may stimulate arousal
eventually even bedtime routine may continue stimulate arousal long original stressful situation abated
patients usually sleep better vacation even weekends
case insomnia drug history essential
patients use alcohol sleep inducer
since effect short lived patient may awaken hours difficulty returning sleep
contrast chronic alcoholic may low total sleep time persistent interruptions sleep
acute withdrawal may accompanied marked delay sleep onset may progress delerium tremens
patients exquisitely sensitive caffeine
inquiry address coffee also tea cola chocolate
cigarette smoking interfere sleep likely stimulating catecholaminergic systems
addition heavy smoker stops smoking may transiently experience sleep disturbance resulting nicotine withdrawal
patient must also asked traditionally recognized sleep medications
long medications used
dose progressively increased
hypnotic medications typically lose efficacy within weeks often prompting increase dosage
added sleep response also becomes merely transient
hypnotic agents used chronically frequent nighttime awakenings minutes may occur
history disturbed sleep maintenance latter half night may suggest shortened drug efficacy due development tolerance
conversely precipitous withdrawal produce marked worsening sleep disturbance often associated nightmares
patient taking central nervous system cns stimulants e g amphetamines
insomnia also result steroid medications centrally acting adrenergic blocking agents
adrenergic agonists xanthines used bronchodilators interfere sleep
latter substances chemically related caffeine
patient general medical condition
pain particularly disturbing sleep
patient frequent headaches angina pectoris reflux esophagitis peptic ulcer disease arthritis
nocturia fever pruritus
paresthesias
patient nocturnal dyspnea coughing
hyperthyroidism renal failure organic brain syndrome
patients disturbed sleep complain associated impaired daytime wakefulness
usually case sleep apnea syndrome characterized multiple periods absent airflow lasting seconds longer occurring least times full hour sleep study
sleep apnea may purely secondary obstruction upper airway case airflow nose mouth despite continued respiratory efforts thorax abdomen may central cessation airflow concomitant interruption thoracic diaphragmatic movements
latter type likely reflects disturbance cns regulation breathing
cases mixedinitially central later obstructive
since sleep apneic patients complain insomnia likely central form history bed partner may necessarily reveal loud snoring gasping respirations
nevertheless observant bed partner may note periods apnea
patients nocturnal myoclonus may report restless sleepers usually unaware periods repetitive twitching legs interspersed periods apparently normal sleep
bed partner may complain kicked patient
patient may reveal history leg cramps disheveled bedding even history falling bed
patient complains difficulty falling asleep even relaxing unusual crawling sensations thighs calves may experiencing restless legs syndrome
dysesthesias often temporarily subside exercise
virtually patients also experience sleep related myoclonus although patients latter condition also restless legs syndrome
noted sleep apnea patient primary complaint may center expected period wakefulness experiences excessive sleepiness
clinician must distinguish daytime sleepiness generalized symptom fatigue
sleepiness refers difficulty remaining awake hours patient would normally expect awake
may impairment patient cognitive motor performance may incomplete arousal awakening
clinically appropriate apply word sleepiness state weariness follows exertion feelings lassitude irritability impaired concentrating ability associated inadequate duration sleep
clinician may determine patient indeed excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even usual full night sleeping
organic basis underlies complaints
brain tumor cns infection must considered patients either narcolepsy sleep apnea syndrome
historical data help make distinction
age onset symptoms
onset teens suggests narcolepsy
patient may report long history social difficulties caused excessive sleepiness
onset occurs beyond age probability narcolepsy decreases
hypersomnolence age would make sleep apnea syndrome likely
yet forms sleep apnea occur age
sleep attacks absolutely irresistible
narcoleptic patients usually unable postpone attack whereas sleep apneic patients may able delay sleep episode absolutely necessary
patient least temporarily refreshed awakens episode
narcoleptic patient usually proceed alertly various tasks driving may even learned self manage problem including several brief naps course day
contrast sleep apneic patient awakens longer naps still unrefreshed
quality patient nighttime sleeping
although many narcoleptic patients experience frequent nocturnal awakenings andor nightmares may relatively restful nighttime sleeping
usually sleep apneic patients report restless nocturnal sleeping along fatigue upon awakening morning
collateral history confirms restlessness describes marked nocturnal snoring periods apnea diagnosis sleep apnea syndrome becomes strengthened
patient experience unusual phenomena associated emotions
many narcoleptics experience degree muscular helplessness response variety emotional experiences
involves partial complete paralysis various antigravity muscles
phenomenon cataplexy present strengthens diagnosis narcolepsy
patients cataplexy may present absence excessive daytime sleepiness
clinician seek two phenomena narcolepsy
normal people experienced mild transient generalized paralysis awakening phenomenon much marked narcoleptic patient usually occurs sleep onset
addition dream images hallucinations may occur sleep onset hypnagogic awakening hypnopompic
although narcoleptic patients experience features presence complete tetrad clinches diagnosis historical grounds alone
automatic behavior also experienced half narcoleptic patients
recurrent daytime sleepiness absence sleep attacks raises remote possibility another condition idiopathic cns hypersomnolence
commonly associated symptoms include headaches syncope complaints raynaud disease
family members often similar symptoms
patients may manifest sleep drunkenness process awakening prolonged often associated disturbed thinking irrational behavior
case hypersomnia important elicit thorough personality profile
grief associated situations may associated increased sleepiness regarded psycho physiological
disorder usually transient rarely may persist disposition weariness
bipolar depression characteristically associated excessive daytime sleepiness
cases depressed patient extends increased nocturnal sleep daytime hours
particular importance drug alcohol history
patient repeatedly using cns depressants
individual may addicted opiates barbiturates sleep inducing drugs may use agents primarily somnolent effects
patients may unintentionally experience effects using moderate high doses medications intended therapeutic purposes e g antihistamines certain antihypertensive agents beta adrenergic blocking agents many psychotropic drugs
elderly patients particularly susceptible somnolent effects medications hypnotic medications intentionally used counter insomnia
furthermore large bedtime doses cns depressants may induce sleep associated impairment ventilation known alveolar hypoventilation syndrome associated significant apneic pauses
condition also occur absence cns depressants
cns stimulants may induce excessive somnolence
although often taken counter daytime fatigue sleepiness often results effect drug wears
furthermore tolerance develops duration action drug shortens miniwithdrawals may appear associated sleepiness
excessive sleepiness may also noted cns stimulants purposely withdrawn
patients excessively use caffeine containing substances may similarly develop tolerance become progressively dependent caffeine
need several cups coffee wake morning may reflect caffeine withdrawal
alcohol overlooked possible etiologic agent excessive somnolence
general medical status may contribute hypersomnolence
conditions considered include endocrinologic disturbances thyroid gland pancreas uremia hepatic encephalopathy morbid obesity
cheyne stokes respirations may associated multiple nocturnal mini arousals resulting excessive daytime sleepiness
may occur nocturnal myoclonus restless legs syndrome
finally patients require longer conventional amount sleep given age may simply high end continuum requirements normal sleep
long sleepers complain poor quality sleep daytime sleepiness difficulties daytime attitude performance provided sleep abbreviated
sleep related complaint may represent another cluster disturbances disorders sleep wake schedule
conceptualize disorders one must view sleep wake behaviors intimately related physiological societal processes
furthermore relationship superimposed influenced hour day night cycle inherent earth rotation
disorders sleep wake schedule constitute collection syndromes share common element dyssynchrony behaviors sleep wake one hand processes human physiology andor society expectations within context hour day
class disorders may transient persistent
regard transient disorders important inquire recent long distance travel air across different time zones
jet lag syndrome occurs result individual usual desire immediately set sleep wake schedule according local time cues destination
since physiological functions sleep wake may take week adapt transient misalignment occurs internal sleep wake phases clock times sleeping waking
result syndrome characterized insomnia desired sleep period sleepiness impaired physical mental functioning desired wake period
rapid time zone change syndrome usually prolonged eastward flights often less severe return trip time zone origin occur north south jet travel hour change time zone
equivalent syndrome termed work shift change conventional sleep wake schedule
symptoms case instead resulting attempt adapt local time cues arise adopting sleep wake pattern runs counter local schedule
result impairment wake period sleep period
persistent disorder may result sleep wake schedule changed frequently
ensuing clinical picture combines elements insomnias disorders excessive somnolence
sleep periods usually shortened disrupted performance desired waking state impaired temporary opportunities revert regular sleep schedule unsuccessful
several questions may help correlate frequently changing sleep wake schedule severity symptoms change many hours shifting involved
frequently shifts occur
interval changes schedule
changing shifts intervals less weeks superimposes new adjustment demands physiological processes still incompletely adapted previous shift
another key historical piece information hour patient usually goes bed
especially elderly early bedtime hour may account early morning awakening patient interprets disturbed sleep
contrast young adults often delay sleep midnight sleep around noon hour
either case may difficult adjust sleeping pattern circumstances demand conventional sleeping hours
clinician encounters patient paired sleep onset wake times either earlier later desired intractably respective diagnoses advanced sleep phase syndrome delayed sleep phase syndrome entertained
patients may complain social occupational conflicts result apparently uncontrollable lack correlation patient physiologic clock usual time clock
disorders patient difficulty falling asleep whenever natural urge followed circumstances allow sleep refreshing sufficient duration
patient may present complaint insomnia excessive daytime sleepiness periodic
case log sleep awakening times several weeks display pattern phenomenon cases reveal patient retiring night progressively later hour
may indicate periodicity patient circadian rhythm appreciably longer usual hours constituting non hour sleep wake syndrome
periodicity patient complaint reflects fact patient internal physiological sleep wake clock progressively moves hour day temporarily coincide conventional clock
however prolonged periodicity patient physiological clock get synchrony society patient complain difficulty getting sleep desired time excessive daytime somnolence
clinicians occasionally encounter patients whose complaints deal disturbing events associated sleep sleep stages partial arousals
although parasomnias constitute perhaps common group sleep disorders found children occasionally adults present disorders
fact various complaints usually relate skeletal muscle phenomena events autonomic nervous system reflects sleep associated activation cns
disturbing dreams may indicate either nightmares sleep terrors
part night disturbance occur
occurrence within first hours sleep onset makes diagnosis sleep terror likely
episodes usually begin scream followed signs distress sweating rapid breathing heart rate seemingly random body movements
household members usually report difficulty awakening patient episodes
however normal sleep seems return spontaneously within minutes
disturbing dreams occur latter part night nightmares dream anxiety attacks likely
exception timing recently recognized type nightmare frightening dream imagery appears patient passing wakefulness sleep
phenomena may part posttraumatic stress syndrome may early manifestation psychotic disorder
patient recall dream content
patient give relatively detailed account disturbing dreams likely experiencing nightmares
patient sleep terrors usually recollection episodes
complaint nightmares prompt questions patient use medications e g reserpine
nightmares may precipitated abrupt withdrawal hypnotics cns stimulants alcohol
unrelated drugs sleep deprivation times induce nightmares
another sleep disturbance usually occurs first part sleep sleepwalking somnambulism
difficulty arousing patient episodes subsequent lack recollection episodes patient hence importance collateral history
frequent sleepwalking adult often suggests emotional disturbance
drug history important since hypnotics alcohol either induce disorder make severe
prolonged periods voluntary wakefulness also exacerbate disorder
clinician familiar parasomnias
bedwetting sleep related enuresis perhaps best known rarely presenting complaint adults
cases clinician needs consider possibility underlying conditions seizure disorder neurogenic bladder stress urinary incontinence lower urinary tract infection
usually patient primary complaint deals underlying conditions rather bedwetting
sleep associated dysfunctions may manifested variety complaints
headaches may secondary teeth grinding bruxism
history repeated abrupt awakenings middle night severe unilateral frontal headaches often associated ipsilateral lacrimation rhinorrhea typical cluster headaches
asthmatics may attack related dreams
worsening cardiovascular symptoms appearance arrhythmias occur sleep
patients may awakened sleep heartburn results gastroesophageal reflux
patients even absence heartburn may multiple miniarousals unaware may occur result delayed clearing acid esophagus sleep
many examples underscore impact sleep central nervous system general autonomic nervous system particular
recent years sleep defined largely terms electrical phenomena recorded clinical sleepbrain wave activity electroencephalogram eeg eye movements electrooculogram eog facial muscular activity transcutaneous electromyogram emg
three study techniques constitute essentials polysomnography allow somewhat arbitrary useful staging sleep wake cycle
although stages defined primarily characteristics eeg features eog emg often useful defining transitions stages
basis polysomnographic studies basic sleep wake cycle categorized three different states wakefulness rapid eye movement rem sleep non rapid eye movement nrem sleep
waking state eeg typically demonstrates low voltage frequencies range hz cycles per second
clusters frequency range hz known theta waves
sinusoidal waves range hz constitute alpha rhythm usually occurs patient relaxed eyes closed still awake
clusters frequency greater hz termed beta rhythm
waking emg reveals certain baseline tone facial muscles
waking eog even patient resting reveals quick conjugate eye movements
nrem sleep usually follows wakefulness separated four stages
stage marked eeg loss alpha rhythm gradual generalized diminishing eeg voltage subsequent appearance theta activity
eye movements reliable sign stage become slow random circular times disconjugate
facial muscles become slightly relaxed
stage drowsiness sleeping patient easily aroused
daydreams may occur
stage ii light sleep spindle sleep characterized eeg findings rhythmical spindle shaped clusters frequency range hz
may accompanied slow blunted high voltage biphasic waves k complexes frequently associated hypnagogic myoclonus
stage ii sleep vertex v waves may indicate nonspecific arousal
stage eye movements usually quiet electrical activity facial muscles diminishes
stages iii iv known slow wave sleep
stage iii usually said present delta waves hz constitute least eeg epoch amplitude mv greater
hence stage sleep well stage iv often also referred delta sleep
delta waves constitute epoch stage iv said present
distinction somewhat arbitrary regarded biologically insignificant
slow wave sleep eye movements usually absent muscle tone similar stage ii sleep
marked resistance arousal clinical feature slow wave sleep hence synonym deep sleep
eeg findings rem sleep include relatively low voltage random mixed frequency spectrum range hz
usually clusters rapid conjugate eye movements
synonym paradoxical sleep derives contrast bursts eye movements phasic body movements loss postural tone resistance arousal
since rem sleep vivid dreams occur term dream sleep also applies
normal sleep initiated sequential progression nrem sleep stages iv followed typically return stage ii sleep usually even briefly precedes initial subsequent periods rem sleep
rem cycles time start one rem period start next last minutes
since rem periods lengthen night progresses rem sleep occurs second half night whereas predominant sleep first half slow wave
mostly latter form sleep prolonged periods body immobility occur presumably give rise feelings relaxation often associated sleep
ages rem sleep accounts total sleep time whereas remainder sleep time divided among various stages nrem sleep
however proportion sleep various nrem stages differs age
duration nocturnal sleep fairly well maintained ages
older people spend less night sleeping state
despite persons age similar younger adults total average amount time spent sleeping typical hour period
average
hours reached older person supplementing lessened amount nocturnal sleep daytime naps andor microsleeps last seconds associated lowering eyelids
microsleeps typical elderly also appear younger individuals progressively deprived sleep
even appearance microsleeps shorter daytime sleep onset latencies noted lack nocturnal sleep becomes progressive
furthermore studies deprivation particular stage sleep produced demonstrated sleep subsequently freely allowed excess deprived stage occur
particularly true rem sleep subsequent rebound amount rem sleep also become increasingly difficult suppress sleep state
phenomenon known rem pressure also become operative whenever pharmacologic suppressants rem sleep used
substances e g tricyclic antidepressants amphetamines certain hypnotics initially suppress onset duration rem sleep
rem pressure normal amount rem sleep subsequently return despite continued use substance
however discontinuance substance immediately shut rem pressure
result rem reboundan increase frequency duration intensity rem periods often experienced nightmares generally disturbed sleep
phenomenon occurs abrupt cessation alcohol following chronic use
rem deprivation alcohol consumption leads exaggerated levels rem sleep alcohol stopped
rem rebound antecedent delerium tremens
apart consideration drug use familiarity various stages sleep fosters enhanced understanding sleep related enuresis sleepwalking sleep terrors nightmares
first three disorders probably represent partial arousals occur slow wave sleep
association sleep stage consistent usual occurrence phenomena first third night slow wave sleep predominant
consistent deep sleep synonym stage individual resists arousal first three disorders usually recall episodes
hand nightmares typically involve awakening rem sleep
frequent occurrence mid late segment nocturnal sleep keeping increased proportion rem sleep second half night
also ability recall nightmares consistent vivid dream imagery rem sleep
integration emotionally important information may one functions dreaming rem sleep
conceivably nightmare may represent failure integrative process
disorders basic polysomnographic findings particular clinical interest
non bipolar depression short rem sleep latency time initial stage ii onset rem sleep accepted biologic marker
rem sleep latency even shorter narcolepsy may represent imbalance wake nrem rem states
rem system continually intrudes upon wake state
accordingly polysomnographic documentation narcolepsy typically involves demonstration abnormalities daytime sleep rather primarily nighttime sleep
characteristic narcolepsy appearance rem sleep within minutes sleep onset
contrast idiopathic cns hypersomnolence involve sleep onset rem periods
regard auxiliary symptoms narcolepsy hypnagogic hallucinations likely represent rem dreaming prior loss consciousness
sleep onset paralysis reflects inhibitory processes rem sleep
cataplexy muscular paralysis aspect rem sleep occurs response emotional arousal patient fully conscious
occasion cataplexy evolve complete rem sleep episode
automatic behavior many narcoleptics may amount daytime sleepwalking occurring repetitive microsleep episodes
sleep disturbancesas distinguished sleep arousal disorders per seshould regarded symptoms
consist broad range clinical presentations involve variety physiologic emotional behavioral abnormalities
consistent hour day night cycle abnormalities often confine sleep period frequently manifest primarily waking hours
consequently clinician must also maintain vigilance possibility sleep arousal disorders considering many patient daytime complaints
explore considerations competence history taking essential
polysomnography appropriate small minority patients even cases studies usually serve confirm clinician already suspects basis history
