sitting patient asked close eyes gently examiner facing patient places stethoscope bell firmly one closed eye
examiner hand thumb rests lightly contralateral carotid artery timing purposes steadying head neck figure
patient asked open eye look fixed object helps eliminate eyelid tremor
finally patient asked hold breath
orbital bruits may faint high pitched examiner concentrate especially systolic phase cardiovascular cycle

examiner allow patient resume respirations auscultation
outset cervical auscultation carotid arteries lightly palpated individually simultaneously acquire feel examination follow
palpation must gentle avoid inadvertent carotid sinus pressure massage
carotid artery auscultation initiated patient either supine sitting
latter position approaching patient behind allows optimal simultaneous carotid palpation auscultation
patient chin points straight ahead stethoscope bell applied achieve skin seal course carotid artery
simultaneous auscultation examiner free hand lightly rests contra lateral carotid artery timing purposes
patient asked inspire deeply hold breath without valsalva seconds
auscultation continues immediately breath holding
holding breath eliminates breath sounds make hearing bruit difficult also accentuates internal carotid bruit see basic science
patient holding breath examiner next compresses contralateral common carotid artery slightly determine whether alters length intensity bruit
remember transient focal cerebral ischemia reported digital pressure neck carotid arteries diagnostic carotid palpation probably contraindicated patient preexistent brain ischemia
finally examiner combines patient breath holding simultaneous compression ipsilateral superficial temporal facial arteries figure

differentiation carotid bruits transmitted cardiac murmurs sometimes poses problem
examiner may slowly inch stethoscope carotid cardiac murmurs increase intensity stethoscope approaches precordium
appropriate consistent physical findings precordium also clarify issue
moreover cardiac murmurs rarely transmitted eye whereas carotid bruits
arterial tortuosity kinking may palpated cervical region source turbulence bruits
also compression syndromes cervical rib scalenus anticus syndrome may also manifest bruits neck

interpretation vascular sounds anatomic location requires basic understanding vascular hemodynamics
arterial bruit usually implies stenosis proximal site auscultation
severe obstruction however may manifest bruit conversely bruits may heard unoccluded normal arteries certain high flow circumstances
bruit may auscultated directly stenosis distally direction blood jet producing vibrations important trace proximally audibility arterial sound determine exact anatomic site flow disturbance
intraarterial pressureflow relationships approximated follows
regional vascular beds resistance main axial artery quite low compared peripheral arteriolar resistance
distal arteriolar tone therefore prime determinant pressure flow
example extremity exercise arteriolar vasodilatation occurs markedly lowering resistance immediately increasing limb blood flow pressure remains relatively constant
prolonged exercise extremity blood flow may increase times resting levels
arterial stenosis increases however resistance site stenosis gradually assumes importance
stenosis becomes severe exercise induced peripheral arteriolar vasodilatation produce increase flow pressure gradient develops across stenotic lesion
critical stenosis substantially changes pressure flow across occlusion occur cross sectional area artery reduced
reduction cross sectional area corresponds reduction lumen diameter
thereafter magnitude pressure gradient depends extent fixed lesion factors remain constant
instantaneous stenotic flow
stenosis increases therefore potential energy pressure proximal stenosis changes increasing kinetic energy velocity within stenosis
increasing flow velocity laminar flow stenosis eventually changes turbulent flow producing vibrations bruit
thus velocity stenotic segment subsequent character bruit depend degree stenosis resulting pressure gradient
degree stenosis considered auscultatory quality timing resultant bruit follow directly
soft early systolic bruit noted lumen diameter
obstruction increases bruit becomes high pitched intense holosystolic
diameter reduction pressure gradient may remain even diastole bruit auscultated systole early diastole
complete occlusion even severe stenosis may cause diminution disappearance bruit blood flow turbulence sufficient cause audible vibrations
additional extrastenotic factors operating regional vascular beds alter flow pressure bruit characteristics fixed stenotic lesion
factors may divided four categories inflow factors side branch factors collateral vessel development outflow factors figure
presence absence variables affect bruit features often altered diagnostic purposes
diagnostic viewpoint maneuvers accentuating localizing bruits helpful physical examination
awareness factors influencing pressure flow across stenosis thus allows estimation degree andor location stenosis
inflow factors mimicking high grade stenosis given arterial segment include high cardiac output states
high output conditions may produce bruits even normal non stenotic arteries
second category side branch factors compression arterial side branches augment bruit main artery diminish side branch bruit whereas augmentation flow side branch would opposite effect
concept especially applicable evaluation carotid artery bruits
extent collateral circulation around critical stenosis influences characteristics bruit
internal carotid artery stenosis example collateral formation usually limited character timing bruit correlate rather closely degree stenosis
contrast lower extremity extensive collateral circulation may develop around stenosis thus altering gradient across stenosis obscuring degree narrowing
outflow factors often important vascular auscultation
arteriolar vasodilatation caused regional exercise valuable accentuating bruits extremities
principles apply directly auscultation cranial cervical supraclavicular vessels
aortic arch arteries common site atherosclerotic lesions arise bifurcation common carotid arteries
detection internal carotid lesions obviously important carotid bruits originate external carotid arteries representing little risk subsequent stroke
side branch factors dynamically altered cervical auscultation accentuate andor localize carotid bruit
carotid auscultation rest examiner compresses superficial temporal facial arteries arising ipsilateral external carotid artery figure
internal carotid bruit may become louder longer whereas external carotid bruit generally becomes noticeably shorter softer compression
internal carotid outflow factors may altered cervical auscultation
carbon dioxide powerful vasodilator normal cerebral vessels
holding breath raises arterial carbon dioxide tension causing active dilatation cerebral arterioles augmenting blood flow intracerebral arterioles
breath holding ordinarily causes increase internal carotid bruit intensity whereas decrease occurs external carotid murmurs
internal carotid outflow also increases careful compression contralateral common carotid artery auscultation
compression decreases flow circle willis intensification prolongation internal carotid bruit diminution external carotid murmur see table
summary
artenovenous fistulas malformations shunt large volumes blood rapid flow high pressure arteries low pressure veins producing continuous murmur systolic accentuation
turbulence venous hum heard internal jugular veins caused combined effects gravity blood flow partial compression internal jugular vein transverse process atlas
hum occurs frequently right side partly right internal jugular innominate veins provide short straight access superior vena cava thus increasing flow velocity right jugular venous return
valsalva maneuver manual compression internal jugular vein recumbent position decrease venous flow obliterate sound
contrast conditions upright posture rapid atrial filling diastole inspiration increase jugular venous flow accentuate venous hum
supraclavicular auscultation arm exercise utilized increase bruits caused stenosis subclavian artery
local exercise extremity supplied stenotic artery increase peripheral outflow producing greater stenotic turbulence augmenting bruit
contrast ipsilateral radial artery compression decreases subclavian outflow shorten obliterate subclavian murmur
trained ear probably still best instrument recognition murmurs
