claudication pain cramp sense fatigue muscle group lower extremity related sustained exercise relieved promptly minutes rest standing evenly feet
claudication occurs elsewhere body symptom arising legs major clinical significance
history intermittent claudication among definitive clinical medicine
anatomic diagnosis arterial obstruction made basis history alone cases
interviewer inquire nature extremity pain explore factors duration location progression reproducibility exercise rest time necessary afford relief
patients regard sensation leg pain instead describe tiredness weakness cramping burning aching dead weight preferable begin inquiry without using pain topic
general question related function lower extremities usually results characteristic description symptoms patients intermittent claudication
one may ask simply difficulty walking
far walk without stop rest
patient gives indication reply ability walk limited discomfort legs unable walk far city blocks without stopping rest examiner encourage describe happens tries walk
patient may relate typical sequence walk pain rest relief leading questions often useful getting full story pain occur exercise
part leg
long last
done relieve
disappears rest typical arterial claudicatory pain walk distance
effect strenuous muscular exertion walking incline climbing stairs jogging carrying weight
discomfort usually experienced dull aching pain calf may sharp radiate limb involve thigh hip buttock even foot muscles
pain usually located one leg legs may involved although one generally worse serves main impediment ambulation
individuals say first sensation fatigue weakness true pain develops persist exercising without pausing rest initial symptoms appear
others observe continue walk despite pain eventually experience numbness limping severe muscular cramping totally unable proceed
indeed forcing limb exercise beyond claudication limit produce tissue damage resultant soreness tenderness lameness several days
patients short distance claudication severe arterial insufficiency may describe paresthesia numbness toes forefoot association intermittent claudication symptoms
general trend claudication worsen gradually period years
nevertheless given stage claudicatory distance fairly constant provided conditions terrain incline speed walking
typically symptoms progress episodes stable periods even intervals improvement interspersed exacerbations
claudication may become acutely severe progress point rest pain patient develops second segment arterial obstruction tandem lesions sustains thrombosis previously stenotic arterial segment suddenly loses major collateral pathway
taking history claudication useful physician patient consider distances terms average level city block
imparato et al
classified mild claudication ability walk blocks feet stopping moderate claudication blocks feet severe claudication less block feet
important questioning establish pain occur simply upon standing persist minutes stopping rest
symptoms would suggestive pain caused neurologic musculoskeletal disorders
night cramps occur bed pain prolonged standing sitting may suggest chronic venous disease also differentiated history
patient uncertain points gives history suggestive intermittent claudication typical examiner may ask individual reproduce symptoms climbing stairs subject perform treadmill exercise observation
claudicatory pain appears nature location duration response rest recorded affected extremity pulses doppler pressures determined
taking remainder medical history interviewer must correlate history claudication male patient description impaired sexual performance dysfunction areas may suggest aortic obstruction leriche syndrome
intermittent claudication diagnosis symptom
refers condition lameness pain lower extremity precipitated muscular exercise relieved minutes rest patient remains standing
present rather specific reliable indicator arterial insufficiency leg
situation gradual arterial occlusion blood flow may adequate maintain comfortable limb rest limited activity upon vigorous exercise muscle groups distal level major arterial obstruction receive inadequate circulation meet metabolic demands
resulting pain thought due accumulation irritating metabolic products ischemic muscle causing stimulation sensory nerves
claudicants stand still rest achieve relief pain allowing blood supply catch previously increased metabolic activity
subjects may walk distance sequence events
pain occur persons normal circulation metabolic products removed adequately abundant blood flow present normal exercising limb
pain claudication usually dull aching type occasion may excruciating totally disabling especially individual persists walking despite ischemic symptoms
although brief period rest generally affords prompt relief claudicatory pain patients severe arterial impairment yield pain signal may note persistent tenderness soreness affected muscle time thereafter
presumably result ischemic myositis caused forcing muscle perform beyond blood flow limit
similar pain characteristic intermittent claudication produced experimental subjects exercise limb presence arterial inflow obstruction severe anemia reduced oxygen content arterial blood
lewis et al
reported claudicatory pain could reproduced exercising otherwise normal limb arterial blood supply stopped
soon thereafter kissin made observation normal human subjects experienced crampy pain exercising muscle group breathing gas mixture containing reduced content oxygen
theorized pain due hypoxemia per se local buildup metabolic products resulting insufficient supply oxygen tissues
pickering wayne described typical intermittent claudication several severely anemic patients completely relieved cure anemia
well known pain muscular exertion occur forearm hand patient upper extremity vascular compromise
discomfort uncommon setting however adequate collateral system arm less vigorous muscular activity extremity compared leg
persons perform heavy physical labor athletes involved sports require repetitive arm motion likely complain arm claudication sedentary individuals degree vascular obstruction
infrequently patients describe claudicatory pain masseter muscle due arterial insufficiency caused obstruction ipsilateral common external carotid artery
pain associated mastication rarely mentioned patient typical atherosclerotic occlusive disease characteristic takayasu arteritis
word claudication latin claudicare meaning limp adopted medical terminology describe painful limp associated exercise
according lewis et al
term intermittent claudication first appeared veterinary literature title paper bouley describing condition lameness horse came exercise traced obstruction blood flow one limb
latter part nineteenth century term picked used physicians describe similar lameness humans affected senile arteritis arterial aneurysms
erb publication helped popularize term attributed walking disability pain produced muscular exercise limb deprived blood flow
subsequently become generally recognized hallmark chronic arterial insufficiency lower extremity commonly occurring presence atherosclerotic occlusive disease
claudication frequent complaint mentioned patients disorder usually first indication significant arterial obstruction leg
although atherosclerosis diffuse process severe arterial obstructions segmental location
atheromatous lesions progress major vessels collateral circulation develops may sufficient preserve viability prevent symptoms rest
indeed sedentary lifestyle may permit peripheral vascular occlusion proceed advanced state minimal symptoms
claudication finally occurs collateral circulation longer adequate supply increased blood flow demands exercising muscle distal obstruction
severity patient claudicatory symptoms depends pattern occlusion degree stenosis rate progression adequacy collateral bed
severe rapidly worsening claudication may signal extensive segmental occlusion multiple levels blockage precluding adequate collateralization
perdue et al
emphasized highly variable patterns lower extremity atherosclerotic disease
claudication may worsen underlying disorder progresses may remain stable years many individuals
collateral system gradually enlarges time greater muscle efficiency achieved patient exercise claudication may actually improve
imparato et al
reported claudicants followed average
years remained stable improved period observation
contrast collateral becomes occluded another major arterial block develops symptoms may suddenly worsen progress rest pain ischemic ulceration skin gangrene limb
reports imparato et al
peabody et al
would suggest risk eventual amputation relatively low patients intermittent claudication presenting complaint
respectively required major amputations observations averaging
years
location claudication pain used predict site major arterial obstruction affected muscle group typically one joint distal level vascular occlusion
physician therefore localize segment anatomic obstruction history alone pain confined calf superficial femoral artery likely site thigh calf iliofemoral segment buttock distally aortoiliac segment
unusual isolated foot claudication symptom atherosclerotic occlusive disease may occur buerger disease tibial arteritides
claudicatory discomfort confined trochanteric region buttock may indication isolated internal iliac andor profunda femoris insufficiency
usually physical examination peripheral vascular system corroborate principles arteriography may necessary define extent disease precision
atherosclerosis basis great majority cases claudication borne mind variety arterial disorders produce identical complaints including vascular trauma arterial embolism buerger disease extrinsic vascular compression aortic dissection takayasu arteritis arteriovenous fistula coarctation aorta cystic degeneration popliteal artery arteriospastic disorders ergotism
despite specific relationship classic intermittent claudication arterial insufficiency patients atypical symptoms differential must made large number causes lower extremity pain venous insufficiency spinal stenosis arthritis nocturnal leg cramps metatarsalgia peripheral neuropathy sciatica myositis osteoporosis gout plantar neuroma mention commonly confused conditions
clinical significance intermittent claudication indicator cardiovascular disease well illustrated longitudinal framingham heart disease epidemiology study
summary experience kannel mcgee affirmed onset claudication increased progressively age peak last decade
claudication prevalence occurs years later life angina pectoris males affected twice often females
commonly observed associated risk factors cigarette smoking diabetes mellitus hypertension hypercholesterolemia relatively weak marker peripheral occlusive disease
mortality rates first years onset intermittent claudication increased twofold men fourfold women cohort
latter observation particular significance planning treatment claudicants since must recognized half subjects coexisting overt cardiovascular disease life threatening potential
addition assessment vascular insufficiency symptoms must individualized according patient lifestyle general health
certainly year old man walk blocks moderate pace significant disability
walking limitation might annoyance individual retired significant comorbid illness would constitute real handicap person otherwise good health must walk keep job
obviously full knowledge factors required decision made regarding diagnostic studies possible surgical treatment
