important ask blood transfusion requirements type surgery especially minor surgery
extravasation blood soft tissues trauma ascertained asking patient family whether big blue areas swelling occurred neck buttocks joints
virtually impossible active youngster significant bleeding problem experience large hematomas synovial bleeding bleeding musculature
bleeding disorder beginning age suggests acquired hemostatic defect symptoms beginning childhood suggest congenital disorder
careful drug history mandatory
many medications affect platelet count affect coagulation proteins unless liver damage occurred patient surreptitiously taking coumadin heparin
clinician narrow sights simplify questions ask specifically aspirin products counter products alka seltzer nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaias platelet count normal
wide variety drugs may lower platelet count medication either suppress bone marrow production platelets increase rate peripheral platelet destruction
drug induced suppression may occur bone marrow stem cell level affecting cellular elements blood pancytopenia notable drugs cancer chemotherapeutic agents
decreased platelet survival present isolated low platelet count found
medications quinidine ones containing sulfon aminide chemical structure often causative agents drugs reported
frequently patient comorbid diseases may produce low platelet count e g infection liver disease autoimmune disease timely observation may required exclude medication cause
thrombocytopenia usually resolves within weeks following discontinuation offending agent much slowly bone marrow hypocellularity exists sometimes
one arts practiced experienced physician drawing sufficient conclusions insufficient premises
type bleeding provides evidence predictive value diagnosis
useful points follows
petechiae attributable platelet vascular abnormalities systemic symptoms present petechiae tender elevated vasculitis suspected
large subcutaneous ecchymoses bruises without petechiae suggest coagulation factor deficiencies liver disease von willebrand disease
hemarthroses usually indicate one hemophilias factor viii ix xi deficiency
purpura intracutaneous bleeding may associated petechiae ecchymoses allergic connotations immune complexes damage capillary endothelium
processes may occur weeks infection present explosive onset purpura gastrointestinal bleeding
telangiectasias occur lips mucous membranes herald potential hemoptysis hematemesis hematuria melena
hospitalized patients start ooze blood around catheters blood letting sites alert physician check disseminated intravascular coagulation vitamin k deficiency thrombocytopenia
mentioned events serve guides formulating rational plan diagnostic studies
traditional medicine centered concept either coagulation protein blood vessel wall platelet aggregation abnormalities etiologies venous arterial bleeding
true cases concepts may challenged simplistic account complex bleeding problems may occur
clear hemostatic mechanism involves interrelated biologic physiologic systems blood remains fluid gels may altered many ways
common denominator among various elements vascular endothelium blood platelets soluble coagulation proteins plasmin intrinsic anticoagulation system contribute clotting
one may altered quantifiably qualitatively
active bleeding may use coagulation proteins sharp separation original inciting abnormality later acquired deficiencies may difficult sort
one often left attempting develop temporal relationship disease state interpretation abnormal coagulation tests obtained later
result vessel wall injury two processes initiated play important roles thrombus formation
platelets attach subendothelial collagen adenosine diphosphate adp released dense bodies organelles residing platelet cytoplasm
process occurring arachidonic acid converted series enzymatic reactions thromboxane via prostaglandin pathway
rate limiting enzyme reaction cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibited aspirin nsaias
thromboxane potentiates aggregating capability adp potent vasoconstrictor
platelet aggregation may occur independent thromboxane provides reason lack protective effect aspirin many patients suffering thrombo occlusive disease
another mechanism considered important platelet interaction subendothelium von willebrand factor might term platelet super glue
von willebrand factor vwf portion factor viii molecule allows initial platelet plug formed injury site withstand shearing force flowing blood
evidence suggests vwf activity depends interaction vwf platelet membrane protein receptor glycoprotein ib
thus patients may hemorrhagic disorders either reduced vwf activity abnormalities platelet receptor
another mechanism importance later clotting fibrinogen attaches platelet membrane receptor glycoprotein iibiiia complex
events occurring realignment membrane phospholipids negatively charged polar head groups exposed plasmatic milieu
thus outside platelet membrane previously composed neutral phospholipids clot promoting ability becomes negatively charged effects clotting
active platelet phospholipid surface may termed platelet factor iii
one see deficiencies adp fibrinogen von willebrand factor thromboxane phospholipid reversing mechanism might inhibit platelet participation coagulation produce bleeding
platelet factor iii activated coagulation factors concentrated platelet surface fibrinogen immediately available via previously described mechanism
two unique complexes composed coagulation protein form negatively charged platelet surface one complex contains factors viii ix x second termed prothrombinase complex contains coagulation factors v activated x prothrombin ii

therefore complex previously described platelet surface containing factors viii ix x activated either factor xi factor vii
dual amplification system leads tremendous increase rate thrombin formation
fibrinogen conversion fibrin thrombin enhanced fibrinogen binding glycoprotein iibiiia platelet surface consequently higher rate fibrin formation observed fibrinogen floating free plasma
fibrin net cross linking fibrin monomer factor xiii occurs reinforces platelet aggregate site injury form stable thrombus plug
etiologies hemorrhagic disease categorized follows
