pain originates kidney usually localized ipsilateral costovertebral angle flank chapter
renal pain caused rapid stretching renal capsule
tension renal capsule may secondary parenchymal edema associated infection trauma caused acute ureteral obstruction relatively sudden distention renal pelvis
conditions cause gradual stretching capsule slowly progressive ureteral obstruction renal tumors usually cause little pain
renal pain often associated nausea vomiting abdominal distention due autonomic innervation kidney shares gastrointestinal tract well secondary inflammation posterior peritoneum
furthermore pain flank often radiates lower abdominal quadrants groin areas
since kidney shares common embryologic origins testes testalgia may accompany flank pain exist alone minimal associated complaints referable kidney region
discomfort arising lower urinary tract usually associated voiding symptoms
suprapubic pain may caused cystitis prostatitis rarely occurs complaint either disorder
bladder prostate inflammation well urinary retention may cause radiation pain lumbosacral region perineum
men chronic prostatitis example often complain pain glans penis perineal pressure sensation described sitting golf ball
testicular pain chapter usually due inflammation trauma ischemia
epididymitis spermatic cord torsion example common etiologies acute scrotal pain
remember disease processes retroperitoneum including kidneys cause referred pain testes
primary diseases scrotum likewise may cause nausea radiation pain ipsilateral groin lower abdomen flank
testis tumors rarely cause scrotal pain usually identified patient physician painless mass
scrotal discomfort associated varicocele usually heavy pulling sensation similar inguinal hernia
complaints referable changes voiding habits usually categorized irritative voiding symptoms obstructive voiding symptoms incontinence
symptom categories provide valuable framework pursuit group differential diagnoses even though may considerable overlap among symptom categories
bladder viewed bag smooth muscle designed store urine empty contents completely
failure store andor failure empty yield symptoms voiding dysfunction
symptoms bladder irritation may caused inflammation infection bladder prostate abnormal innervation bladder sphincteric mechanism
symptoms include frequency urgency dysuria suprapubic pain chapter
frequent precipitous urge empty bladder leads voiding relatively small volumes urine
urgency severe urge incontinence occurs strong detrusor contraction inhibited long enough make voiding convenient
dysuria usually refers pain urethra voiding may include suprapubic perineal pain voiding well
disorder irritates bladder mucosa intrinsically extrinsically cause symptoms
obstructive voiding symptoms caused obstruction flow urine bladder
common etiology men benign prostatic hyperplasia
syndrome obstructive symptoms therefore often called prostatism
men may also symptoms presence prostatitis resultant edema bladder outlet obstruction urethral stricture
women may obstructive voiding symptoms well etiology often neurogenic psychologic basis anatomic obstruction
symptoms include hesitancy decreased stream force caliber straining void sensation post void residual accompanied double voiding finish emptying bladder
frequency nocturia may also present due inefficient emptying chapter
involuntary loss urine termed incontinence chapter
different forms incontinence imply various etiologies loss control
loss may spontaneous therefore associated antecedent urge void physical activity
stress urinary incontinence occurs sudden increase intra abdominal pressure coughing laughing sneezing lifting
symptom alone implies anatomic neuromuscular incompetence sphincteric mechanism
urge incontinence occurs desire void develops rapidly
urine lost voiding voluntarily postponed
urgency symptom implies bladder irritation abnormal innervation
appearance blood urine chapter often frightening patient
sign malignancy implication understandably disturbing
allaying anxiety reassuring patient exsanguination rarely occurs basis hematuria first steps physician evaluation
physician also understand relatively small volumes blood required make urine appear red
specific questions answered order characterize hematuria
dark brown tea colored urine usually means source bleeding kidney ureter
bleeding either bladder prostate urethra usually yields bright red urine
color difference depends exposure time blood acidic ph urine
blood initial part voided stream usually source prostate urethra
terminal hematuria usually implies bleeding bladder emptying completed
total hematuria blood throughout voided stream usually due upper urinary tract bleeding kidneys ureters
presence clots implies active bleeding urinary stasis site bleeding
presence absence pain voiding different implications
painful hematuria associated abdominal pain flank pain suprapubic pain dysuria
etiology hematuria discomfort types likely benign hematuria usually due urinary infection obstructing calculus
painless hematuria contrast likely related malignancy urinary tract
characterization hematuria complaint serves guide building list differential diagnoses
associations absolutes complete diagnostic evaluation carried patients
microscopic hematuria receive complete investigation gross hematuria amount bleeding directly related severity cause
patient age general health associated complaints clinical findings considered formulating diagnostic plan
thorough history utmost importance evaluation male erectile dysfunction chapter
part evaluation alone may yield final diagnosis
history medical diseases diabetes mellitus renal disease surgical problems atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease may immediately identify potential causes impotence
list current previous medications reviewed carefully
regardless presence previous illnesses nature patient complaints clearly defined beginning
questions regarding time course onset settings dysfunction occurs answered first
rapid onset personally tragic event example may imply psychogenic impotence
gradual progression usually seen organic causes
potency one sexual partner impotence another implies psychogenic impotence
concomitant loss libido well erectile function raises suspicion sex hormone problem
adult men several erections night sleep
history presence nocturnal early morning erections patient complaining impotence clue psychogenic etiology
differentiation made inability achieve erection premature loss erection orgasm premature ejaculation
patient questioned regarding present past pain erections ejaculation angulation erect penis
peyronie disease example initially causes angulation erect penis eventual progression impotence
evaluation external genitalia males chapter includes examination penis scrotum scrotal contents
performed warm room allow maximum dartos cremasteric muscle relaxation
area examined initially patient supine standing upright
many physical findings may easily identified one position
examining genitalia estimation androgenic stimulation masculinization gained noting condition skin area well amount distribution pubic hair
examination penis includes skin corporal erectile bodies urethral meatus
noted whether patient circumcised uncircumcised
ease redundant prepuce retracted assessed
entire penile skin including beneath prepuce examined ulcers warts rashes lesions
size position skin lesion described along degree tenderness palpation fixation subcutaneous tissue
penile skin lesions found correlation palpable deep superficial inguinal adenopathy made time
corpus cavernosum corpus spongiosum palpated masses areas induration tenderness skin fixation
position external urethral meatus noted along comment adequacy size
examination urethral discharge urethral mucosal lesions near meatus also carried everting lips meatus
entire scrotal skin examined evidence inflammation ulceration solid mass
skin scrotal wall composed dartos muscle investing fascia parietal layer tunica vaginalis
dartos muscle contracts response cool temperature warming mechanism testes
testis adnexa examined palpation
size consistency testes noted careful documentation areas mass effect induration
normal testis smooth firm consistency
normal state epididymis lies vertically along posterior lateral aspect testis easily delineated testis palpation
size masses areas induration areas tenderness described along notation location head upper pole body tail lower pole epididymis
induration tenderness found important note whether overlying skin erythema edema fixation present
scrotal mass identified documentation made whether mass transilluminates
examination dark room small strong light source required
although testicular tumors associated hydrocele masses scrotum transilluminate benign
spermatic cord contents examined
vas deferens easily palpable nontender normal males
spermatic cord palpated level external inguinal ring routine examination rule inguinal hernia made
varicocele mass dilated veins spermatic cord tributaries pampiniform plexus
varicoceles may become evident repeated valsalva maneuvers cause veins distend
scrotum envisioned annex abdomen since contents originated abdomen
testes housed adult scrotum provide cooler environment spermatogenesis sperm maturation transport
prostate gland heart shaped organ whose posterior surface palpated anterior wall rectum
apex prostate near anal verge narrowest distal extent
base proximal extent junction bladder neck prostate
best position patient digital examination standing hips flexed degrees allowing lean forward onto examination table chair
legs spread wide apart toes pointed inward
position allows maximal relaxation anal sphincter thereby facilitates thorough comfortable examination patient
position gravity pulls prostate easier palpation
patient able get bed digital examination done alternatively modified lithotomy position
position similar used bimanual pelvic examination female
size consistency entire prostate noted along focal changes consistency
nodule indurated area suggests carcinoma
diameter abnormal area estimated drawing made findings
prostate gland symmetric respect median sulcus midline groove posterior surface
asymmetry despite normal consistency suggestive carcinoma warrants investigation
except extremely large prostate glands lateral sulcus side palpable without change consistency depth sulcus
seminal vesicles ampulla vas deferens palpable normal state
mass area induration superior prostate digital rectal examination therefore warrants investigation
