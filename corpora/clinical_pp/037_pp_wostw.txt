cough sudden usually involuntary expulsion air lungs characteristic easily recognizable sound
although known common symptom respiratory disorders serves functions defending respiratory tract noxious substances maintaining airway patency removing excessive secretions air passages
expectoration sputum production act coughing spitting material produced respiratory tract
careful history helpful task evaluation patients cough suggest diagnosis cause instances
cough part patient presenting symptoms presence absence determined pointed questions directed patient also spouse family members patient may unaware cough may underestimate frequency duration
example uncommon patients chronic bronchitis oblivious frequent coughing people around quite annoyed
patients may perceive cough throat clearing
many times truth patient cough reveals observer interview physical examination
acknowledged patient cough adequate information characteristics circumstances obtained appropriate questioning
onset cough sudden insidious
initiating event
start isolated symptom occur follow symptoms
long cough present
persistent episodic
seasonal perennial
determine severity cough ask frequent coughing spell
long coughing spell last
effect daily activity rest
cough productive dry
lack expectoration necessarily indicate cough dry many patients particularly children women tend swallow sputum raised level pharynx
sound cough would help determining productive dry nature
patients sputum production asked frequency description physical characteristics sputum including amount coughing spell daily total color consistency ease expectoration taste smell
cough symptom associated respiratory nonrespiratory symptoms
inquiry specifically made conditions known cause cough particularly chronic persistent
addition accurate smoking history see chapter ask respiratory irritants patient exposed home work
exposure accidental intentional
precipitating aggravating factors
time day night cough sputum production worse
happen supine position upon arising morning drinking eating exercise breathing cold dry air
cough awaken patient sleep
past history recent old foreign body aspiration
pattern cough amount characteristics sputum changed recently
patient locate site origin cough sputum throat deeper chest
patient similar problem coughing past
cough easily recognizable characteristics croup whooping cough
dynamic effect cough creation airflow velocity within certain portion airway intense enough shear dislodge secretions accumulated mucosal surface
although coughing may entirely voluntary usually physiologic reflex
mediated reflex arc made sensory receptors afferent nerve fibers center efferent nerve fibers effector muscles
cough receptors considered rapidly adapting nerve endings also known irritant receptors
nerve endings plentiful mucosa larynx carina trachea large bronchi readily stimulated mechanical chemical irritants
portions airways cough effective clearing secretions
cough receptors also demonstrated suspected sites including pharynx peripheral airways intra extrathoracic sites pleura ear canals tympanic membrane even stomach
vagus important afferent nerve although glossopharyngeal trigeminal nerves may operate depending receptors involved
medullary cough center postulated proof precise anatomic location
center influence higher voluntary nerve centers may initiate modify cough
efferent nerves vagi recurrent laryngeals phrenic nerves spinal motor nerves expiratory muscles
mechanical events involved typical cough rapid successions fairly deep initial inspiration tight closure glottis reinforced supraglottic structures quick forceful contraction expiratory muscles sudden opening glottis contraction expiratory muscles continues
high intrapulmonary pressure generated last two phases results rapid airflow lungs glottis open
addition pressure difference outside inside intrathoracic airways phase causes dynamic compression narrowing
combination high airflow airway narrowing results expulsion airstream linear velocity sometimes nearing speed sound
blast air thus produced capable expelling secretions great force
site extent dynamic compression determined lung volumes
large lung volumes trachea large bronchi compressed smaller lung volumes distal airways also narrowed
successive cough without intervening inspiration seen patients chronic bronchitis lung volumes become smaller cough becomes effective also removing secretions distal airways
ensuing deep inspiration cough restarts larger lung volumes cycle repeats
characteristic explosive sound coughing results vibrations vocal cords mucosal folds glottis accumulated secretions
variation sounds coughing due several factors including nature quantity secretions anatomic differences pathologic change larynx air passages force cough
vibrations coughing also help dislodging secretions airway walls
small amounts tracheobronchial secretions normally produced effectively handled mucociliary clearance mechanism
secretions made water dialyzable substances electrolytes glucose mucus glycoprotein indigenous transudated proteins lipids surfactant
mucous glands goblet cells primary sources tracheobronchial mucus
forming thin blanket airway mucus covers ciliated epithelium
rhythmic vibrations cilia propel toward pharynx swallowed usually unnoticed
proper balance formation clearance maintains thin protective layer mucus trapping removing impurities inspired air preventing excessive accumulation secretions
adequate function mucociliary escalator cough additional benefit removing amount secretions formed normal conditions
pathologic states however mucociliary function ineffective insufficient quantity alteration physical properties secretions cough becomes essential airway clearance
although coughing effective excessive secretions accumulated large centrally located airways also plays important role clearing peripheral airways situations impaired mucociliary clearance chronic bronchitis cystic fibrosis primary ciliary dyskinesia immotile cilia syndrome
milking effect coughing peripheral airways suggested mechanism action removing secretions sites
requires coughing low lung volumes secretions squeezed small airways toward centrally located bronchi
addition mucus expectorated sputum may contain endogenous exogenous materials including transudated exudated fluids various local migrated cells microorganisms necrotic tissues cells aspirated vomitus foreign particles
gross appearance physical characteristics sputum result content materials
mucous sputum clear translucent viscous containing small numbers microscopic elements
purulent sputum white yellow green opaque
indicates presence large numbers white blood cells especially neutrophilic granulocytes
asthmatics sputum may look purulent eosinophilic cells
red coloration uniform streaky usually due mixture blood
carbon particles discolor sputum gray cigarette smokers black coal miners smoke inhalation
cardinal manifestation respiratory diseases coughing one common symptoms encountered clinical medicine
physiologic reflex cough also occurs without demonstrable evidence disease triggered stimulation irritant receptors
moreover may voluntary act may result nervous habit
although clinical significance coughing many instances trivial may indication serious intrathoracic disease
pathologic conditions causing cough usually ones irritate airways increase irritability result deformation increase tracheobronchial secretions
factors may operate singly various combinations
sputum production coughing occurs respiratory tract secretions beyond ability mucociliary mechanism deal
common cause acute cough clinical significance viral tracheobronchitis
cough transient self limited condition beginning nonproductive quite annoying later becomes productive mucous mucopurulent sputum begins subside
inflammation respiratory tract mucosa infectious noninfectious causes results hyper reactivity cough receptors
results alteration surface epithelium making sensitive cough producing effect commonly occurring mild irritants cold air respiratory pollutants deep fast respiration excessive use larynx
times mechanical irritation coughing brings coughing
inflammation addition increases secretions
acute viral respiratory tract infection post nasal drip may another cause triggering cough
infectious well noninfectious diseases upper lower respiratory tract known propensity causing cough part clinical manifestations table
chronic cough defined cough lasting minimum duration weeks usually indicative structural changes respiratory tract persistence cough stimulating factors

chronic cough may manifestation many pathologic conditions involving intra extrathoracic organs table
left sided heart failure results cough acute pulmonary edema also may cause chronic nocturnal cough
recurrent aspiration another condition cough characteristically occurs supine position
foreign body aspiration always considered differential diagnosis chronic cough
initial coughing choking episode time aspiration cough may restart continue long incident
less common intraluminal compressing lesions tracheobronchial tree chronic inflammatory fibrosing lung diseases extrapulmonary lesions may cough predominant symptom
tumors mediastinum enlarged heart chambers pleural disease may manifest cough
psychogenic intentional cough personal gain seriously considered causes properly excluded
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril enalapril used treatment hypertension congestive heart failure increasingly recognized cause dry annoying often incessant cough disappears discontinuation agents
characteristics expectorated sputum often suggest diagnosis cause
chronic expectoration large amounts purulent foul smelling sputum strongly suggestive bronchiectasis
sudden production sputum febrile patient indicates lung abscess
rust colored purulent sputum pneumococcal pneumonia currant jelly sticky sputum klebsiella pneumonia blood tinged foamy sputum pulmonary edema examples diagnosis underlying disease strongly suggested
