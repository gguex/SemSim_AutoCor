recall order cell propagate transmembrane action potential depolarize resting potential must brought threshold
two mechanisms may accomplished
first simplest electrically stimulate cell outside source
stimulus weak resting potential reduced threshold depolarization occur
stimulus sufficiently strong reduce resting potential threshold transmembrane action potential propagated
nearly cells heart depolarized fashion cell stimulated externally neighboring cell
second mechanism resting potential reduced threshold termed automaticity
automatic cell one displays gradual spontaneous loss negativity diastole phenomenon termed diastolic depolarization numbered phase transmembrane action potential figure
heart two kinds cells electrically automatic electrically nonautomatic
muscle cells generally nonautomatic
resting potential remains constant cell stimulated reach threshold
automatic cell hand demonstrates phase diastolic depolarization see figure

thus figure vector directed away electrode toward electrode b negative deflection recorded positive deflection b
segment muscle depolarizes must repolarize
repolarization directionthat endocardium epicardium represented reinstitution cell negativity repolarization wave reflected surface tracing would reflected identical complex opposite direction
fact repolarization ventricle travels opposite direction depolarization probably result delay repolarization endocardium due intraluminal left ventricular cavity pressure

exactly bradycardias essential distinguish tachycardias supraventricular origin ventricular origin since etiology prognosis therapy differ two
essential clinical features differentiating various tachycardias listed table
though overly simplistic supraventricular tachycardias generally divided three types paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt atrial flutter atrial fibrillation
psvt commonly occurs otherwise normal hearts
atrial flutter atrial fibrillation imply cardiac disease variety types including hypertensive cardiomyopathic ischemic valvular disease
rate psvt generally quite rapid range cpm figure

carotid sinus massage atrial flutter persists ratio av block may increase consequent halving ventricular rate transiently
atria depolarize cpm atrial fibrillation course impulses traverse av node reach av node varying intervals conducting varying distances node resulting variable ventricular response quite irregular figure c
first heart sound may vary somewhat intensity depending upon irregularity pulse
carotid sinus massage may transient slowing ventricular response
reference electrocardiograms figure

supraventricular rate rapid greater cpm impulses may reach ventricle prior full repolarization recovery excitability action potentials conducting system consequently impulses conduct aberrantly
addition refractory period given impulse directly related preceding rr interval
longer interval longer refractory period likely subsequent impulse conduct aberrantly occurs relatively prematurely
words long interval prolongs refractory period followed short interval impulse following short interval may reach conducting system still refractory thus conducting aberrantly

basic science section discussed repolarizalion abnormalities accompanying electrolyte fluxes
entire host events alter repolarization hence st segment including ischemia hypoxemia electrolyte abnormalities potassium calcium magnesium drugs digitalis antiarrhythmics tricyclic antidepressants virtually disease affecting myocardium myocarditis cardiomyopathy trauma tumor
