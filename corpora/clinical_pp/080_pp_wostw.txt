lists symptoms gastrointestinal disease
pain common complaint related abdominal problems
important points cover patient location duration pain change location intensity known precipitating factors associated symptoms fever chills nausea vomiting change bowel habits
one must also inquire associated abdominal findings bloody stools melena abdominal distention
examiner clear idea present illness inquire previous episodes illness similar illnesses
brief history previous illnesses acute chronic may helpful review previous operations medications allergies imperative
table
presents sequence steps examining gastrointestinal system
special instruments required examination abdomen
good lighting stethoscope needed
common abnormalities may disclosed examination listed table
convenience abdomen divided quadrants figure
areas figure
umbilicus central point abdomen dividing right left upper lower
masses found inspection palpation tenderness found palpation described according quadrant found
example swollen gallbladder acute cholecystitis may cause tender mass right upper quadrant
thus important relate quadrants abdomen underlying organs figure
patient placed supine examining table bed
helpful place small pillow beneath knees relax abdominal musculature
head rest comfortably small pillow
patient arms rest comfortably sides
drapes placed breasts groins inguinal regions preserve modesty
examiner stands patient right
general contour abdomen examined abnormalities
notice made whether abdomen distended scaphoid whether bulging flanks whether umbilicus inverted everted
skin abdominal wall examined carefully hemangiomas dilated veins caput medusa indicative severe liver disease
skin also examined carefully scars correlating previous operations
quadrant abdomen next carefully inspected visible masses
abdominal wall inspected carefully respiration asymmetry motion
asymmetry may well due muscular rigidity underlying inflammation
surgical scars carefully inspected bulges may indicate herniation
patient asked cough check herniation
similarly one inspect inguinal femoral regions herniation normal respiration cough
abdominal examination auscultation performed palpation palpation may alter bowel sounds
starting right upper quadrant examiner listens liver rubs bruits free abdominal wall bowel sounds
one moves next left upper quadrant listening bowel sounds spleen detect rubs bruits
one next auscultate periumbilical regions aortic renal bruits bowel sounds left right lower quadrants bowel sounds iliac bruits
course auscultation bowel sounds detected one auscultate periumbilical region full minutes determining bowel sounds absent
important points note bowel sounds pitch intensity duration sounds
bruits noted carefully localized loudest point relates origin bruit
palpation abdomen involves using flat hand fingers fingertips figure
detect palpable organs abnormal masses tenderness
orderly approach necessary prevent oversights
one begin right upper quadrant palpation liver
flat right hand placed abdominal wall fingertips pointing toward right shoulder
fingertips cm costal margin figure
patient asked inspire deeply bringing liver edge fingertips
one note consistency liver whether tenderness
noted whether edge liver sharp blunted nodular
examiner hand may moved along liver edge outlining size liver
alternative method palpating liver hook fingers around costal margin patient inspire deeply bring liver edge figure
technique particularly effective patients normal liver size
liver examined one palpates right upper quadrant masses tenderness
one uses flat hand fingers palpation
mass noted often helpful outline mass using two handed palpation
left hand used push right hand thus overcome abdominal musculature examine mass figure
mass noted one moves left upper quadrant
one palpates carefully masses tenderness left upper quadrant
attempt made palpation spleen fashion liver
normal spleen palpable thinnest individuals
spleen palpable supine position patient turned right lateral position
examiner stands patient right palpates right hand using left hand exert pressure patient left flank figure
pushes spleen anteriorly often makes palpable
one next moves periumbilical region palpating mass tenderness
one particularly cognizant aortic bifurcation umbilicus aortic aneurysm commonly present pulsatile mass umbilicus
umbilicus carefully palpated detection herniation lymphadenopathy
left lower quadrant flank next palpated
lower pole left kidney may palpable thin individuals firm rounded smooth mass left flank
sigmoid colon may palpable tubular structure low left lower quadrant
note made tenderness abnormal masses left lower quadrant
attention next directed right lower quadrant flank
left lower pole right kidney may palpable right flank
cecum may palpable thin individuals fluctuant poorly defined mass low right lower quadrant
note must made abnormal mass tenderness
special attention next directed incisional scars
patient asked cough perform valsalva maneuver scars palpated check incisional herniation
similarly inguinal femoral regions palpated cough valsalva detection hernia
percussion abdomen performed check liver size spleen size abnormal gas collections
size liver estimated determining span liver dullness percussion
performed percussing breast midclavicular line
resonant note obtained underlying air figure
percussion proceeds caudally dome liver dullness noted
percussion continued caudally resonance returns indicating examiner reached hepatic flexure colon hepatic edge figure
normal liver span cm
dullness absent liver may sign intra abdominal gas might occur perforated viscus
using similar technique percussion used outline size spleen
percussing midaxillary line normal splenic dullness detected ninth eleventh intercostal space
dullness encompasses larger area splenomegaly usually present
percussion next performed right upper quadrant check gas within hepatic flexure left upper quadrant check gas stomach splenic flexure left lower quadrant check gas sigmoid right lower quadrant check gas cecum
percussion periumbilical region delineate presence gas within small bowel loops
mass noted inspection palpation abdomen also carefully percussed time determine gas within mass
would indicative mass either distended loop bowel free intraperitoneal air
ascites searched carefully especially patient bulging flanks protuberant abdomen
informative examination presence absence ascites search shifting dullness
performed beginning flank percussion proceeding anteriorly note changes dull tympanitic indicating bowel loops reached
area marked pen patient rotated toward flank allow fluid shift anteriorly
examination repeated
note changes dullness tympany marked
change previous mark indicates free intra abdominal fluid figure
another test helpful identifying ascites presence fluid wave
patient assistant indents anterior abdominal wall midline examiner places flat hand one flank taps gently flank finger
significant ascites present fluid wave transmitted tapping finger receptive hand figure
patient next asked turn left lateral decubitus position right hip knee fully flexed left hip knee slightly flexed
gluteal region edge examining table
anal area carefully examined skin lesions scars fistula tracts external hemorrhoids
gloved right index finger well lubricated inserted anally
resistance anal ring usually due spasm caused nervousness may overcome asking patient strain finger inserted
anal wall carefully palpated taking note hypertrophic apaillae inflamed crypts strictures sphincter tone
fingertip palpates rectum check rectal mass condition prostate
examination inguinal region best performed patient stand erect facing examiner seated stool
examiner inspect inguinal region evidence abnormal protrusions masses along course spermatic cord scrotum figure
suspicious mass detected inspection patient asked cough see additional impulse occurs
asked attempt reduce mass possible
mass evident examiner palpate inguinal regions
best done inserting index finger along spermatic cord inverting scrotal skin pubic tubercle sweeping laterally identify external ring figure
subject instructed cough indirect inguinal hernia present examiner detect impulse sac proceeds along inguinal canal exit external ring
general bulge detected medial inguinal region differentiation direct indirect inguinal hernia occasionally made physical examination pressing directly internal ring thereby arresting descent indirect hernia figure
subject coughs protrusion occurs internal ring occluded one assume hernia direct hernia lower abdominal wall
one must keep mind possibility femoral hernias region
exit femoral canal present bulge inguinal ligament
occasionally femoral hernia loops cephalad inguinal ligament presenting direct indirect inguinal hernia
palpation femoral canal confirm femoral origination hernia
