principal signs cerebellar dysfunction following
ataxia unsteadiness incoordination limbs posture gait
disorder control force timing movements leading abnormalities speed range rhythm starting stopping
hypotonia normal resting muscle tension reduced leading decreased muscle tone abnormal positions parts body
tremor intention tremor hand purposive movement common coarse rapid side side oscillations increase movement goal approached
resting tremors limbs head trunk occur
times paroxysms tremors severe enough shake entire bed delude unwary physician suspecting seizure activity
gait station manner standing abnormal legs apart swaying body
patient staggers reels lurches walking
ocular motor abnormalities saccadic dysmetria impaired smooth tracking fixation abnormalities various forms nystagmus see
patient sit side bed table
note position limbs hypotonia produce bizarre positions
head deviated one side
look resting tremors limbs trunk
times severity cause head bob titubate
observe eyes primary position nystagmus problems fixation
observe nystagmus patient follows test object examiner fingers six diagnostic positions gaze see chapter cranial nerves iii iv vi
ocular dysmetria seen best patient command moves eyes eccentric position gaze primary position gaze
examiner holds one hand directly front patient degrees primary position patient gazes straight ahead
patient asked fixate eccentric hand command shift gaze hand primary position
observe eyes overshooting target fixate primary position
speech frequently involved
characteristic changes heard full blown case never forgotten
begin patient take deep breath maintain ahhh long possible
procedure basically tests expiratory muscles vocal cords
listen variations pitch volume tremor
ask patient say la la la long possible
maneuver superimposes rapid alternating movements tongue upon function expiratory muscles vocal cords
ask patient say long possible thus testing rapid alternating movements lips
finally ask patient read simple paragraph listen meter volume pitch enunciation
passively flex extend arm elbow assess tone
patient extend arm front elbows slightly flexed eyes closed
observe tremor
assess postural fixation tone observing drift tapping sharply proximally explaining
cerebellar dysfunction marked wavering arm tapping difficulty maintaining posture trunk
test rebound right arm placing right hand patient right shoulder
maneuver prevents arm striking patient face cerebellar dysfunction indeed present
grasp patient right wrist left hand
ask patient flex right arm sharply suddenly let go
patient dysfunction unable arrest progress arm rebound markedly right arm
test rapid alternating movements first one hand thigh slapping test
use sitting position
patient strike first palm dorsum hand upon thigh knee
abnormalities likely brought make sure hand reversed strike performance rapid possible length movement breast high
observe abnormalities force timing difficulty alternating palm dorsum hand
test finger nose finger alternating movements patient first touch pad index finger pad index finger
patient touches nose pad index finger thus requiring reversal hand
patient rapidly possible
observe intention tremor coarse side side tremor increases finger patient nose approached
irregularities control timing force movement cerebellar dysfunction
abnormalities intensified position examiner finger moved time
interesting little test performed patients use fingers tap tune table
cerebellar dysfunction disturbances timing force striking quite apparent
known arrhythmokinesis
first patient stands rest
observe whether feet placed close together normally wide apart
normally individuals stand rest little shifting feet movement body
cerebellar dysfunction patient shifts trunk wavers unsteadily
many instances patients unable stand without support
ask patient walk usual fashion across room back
bilateral cerebellar disease reeling rolling lurching staggering gait resembles drunkenness
unilateral cerebellar disease deviation side lesion probably result hypotonia
test tandem walking
ask patient walk straight line heel toe
probably sensitive test function vermis cerebellum
first function lost alcoholic cerebellar cortical degeneration
reliable rapid screening test alcoholic cerebellar dysfunction possibility
patient lie faceup bed observe performance following tests
right heel taps left knee gently hammer taps nail
arc swing cm
observe abnormalities force rhythm
test left leg
right heel starts top left knee slides shin foot
heel stay exactly top shin
abnormal coarse side side tremor heel goes shin
knee optimal starting position
patients abnormality marked knee disappears heel goes shin
also insist heel placed top shin midline since makes dysfunction prominent
field cerebellar anatomy physiology one complex rapidly advancing areas neurosciences
section give briefest background information focusing primarily clinical correlations
anatomically cerebellum divided transversely three lobes anterior posterior flocculonodular longitudinally midline vermis two lateral hemispheres larsell nomenclature figure
simplified scheme cerebellar organization given table
modified demyer
exceptions generalizations
cerebellum divided three longitudinal zones basis afferent connections
vestibulocerebellum afferents vestibular nuclei spinocerebellum afferents spinal cord pontocerebellum corticocerebellum afferents cerebral cortex via pontine nuclei
divisions project onto cerebellar nuclei efferent connections outlined scheme
three subdivisions exactly correspond anatomical divisions considerable overlap
demyer put function cerebellum lucidly pointing cerebellum probably evolved vestibular nuclei
using information provided vestibular system areas cerebellum equilibrates contractions axial musculature eyes head properly positioned
higher animals cerebellum takes additional role seeing smooth performance voluntary movements limbs working closely cerebrum
thus cerebellum sitting astride vestibular nuclei receives one hand information proprioceptive system information commands cerebral cortex sending muscles
cerebellum sees movements performed smooth coordinated fashion receiving constant feedback actually happening
information happening muscles comes muscle spindles tendon organs touch pressure receptors labyrinth
afferent impulses converge purkinje cells spinocerebellar vestibulocerebellar portions cerebellar cortex see figure either directly synapse granule cells
efferent output purkinje cells goes cerebellar nuclei dentate fastigial interpositus thence spinal cord therefore lower motor neurons vestibular nuclei cerebral cortex
interrelationships cerebral cortex complex
basically area cerebral cortex sends efferents cerebellum turn gets efferents area cerebellum
pathways cerebral cortex cerebellum divided two groups brodal
routes via inferior olive pontine nuclei red nucleus show precise topical organization
routes via reticular nuclei principally
nuclei diffusely organized thus integrate impulses many different sources reach cerebellum
cerebellar efferents cortex go dentate nucleus mostly nucleus ventralis lateralis thalamus thence cortex
efferents cerebral cortex cerebellum go contralateral cerebellar hemisphere
thus right cerebellar hemisphere ultimately receives afferents right side body left cerebral cortex sends efferents locations
cerebellum exerts influence motor activity via cerebral cortex
also directly influences gamma fiber systems spinal cord level thus influencing postural tone reflexes
nature cerebellar influence still incompletely understood
many problems localization cerebellar symptoms

variety clinical signs cerebellar disease table
signs studied detail recently gilman gilman bloedel lechtenberg
stance gait abnormalities common clinical signs
reflect disease midline zone cerebellum
broad based stance truncal instability walking causing falls either side
steps irregular feet may lifted high
gait ataxia without limb impairment occurring commonly alcohol damage nutritional deficiency indicates damage anterior superior vermis
flocculonodular lesions also produce stance gait abnormalities
tandem walking often earliest abnormality maneuver severely affected
titubation consists rhythmic body head tremor
rotatory rocking bobbing movement
clinically turned localizing value respect part cerebellum involved
head rotated tilt one side
titubation useful localizing value
oculomotor disturbances cerebellar disease worked detail pure cerebellar degenerations leigh zee zee
frequent abnormalities include dysmetric saccades fixation abnormalities impaired smooth pursuit postsaccadic drift gaze evoked nystagmus rebound nystagmus downbeat nystagmus positional nystagmus
saccadic dysmetria likely indicates dysfunction dorsal vermis fastigial nuclei
function structures control saccade amplitude
vestibulocerebellum flocculus acts provide stabilization retinal image dysfunction producing impaired smooth tracking impaired fixation suppression caloric nystagmus postsaccadic drift
