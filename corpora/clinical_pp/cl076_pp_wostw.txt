dysautonomia refers abnormality function autonomic nervous system
two divisions autonomic nervous system sympathetic parasympathetic
although latter occasionally may involved abnormal function sympathetic division produces striking symptoms dysautonomic syndromes
term orthostatic hypotension often used synonym dysautonomia
dramatic symptoms one often brings patient physician adequate description full dysautonomic syndrome
dysautonomia single disease process
autonomic nervous system may undergo injury part several different degenerative neurologic diseases
primary dysautonomias
also nonneurologic systemic illnesses variety causes injury autonomic nervous system may occur become predominant component
secondary dysautonomias
finally side effects drugs often manifested abnormalities function autonomic nervous system producing iatrogenic form dysautonomia
many causes dysautonomia listed table
dysautonomia produce unique symptoms
patient individual complaints part another disease process
set symptoms taken together suggests dysautonomic state present
obtaining history therefore three tasks must accomplished
physician must
develop sufficient body information establish dysautonomic syndrome actually exists
distinguish secondary dysautonomias including drug side effects many improve disappear causative problem treated primary dysautonomias symptomatic relief
distinguish among several forms primary dysautonomia since different natural histories prognoses
symptoms primary dysautonomia listed table
postural syncope symptoms often mild subtle may become evident careful detailed review systems
postural dizziness syncope striking symptom dysautonomia
commonly reported usually sufficiently disturbing chief complaint presenting problem
note symptoms evident patient postural dizziness syncope one manifestations cerebrovascular ischemia noted table
symptoms due orthostatic postural hypotension latter sign elicited physical examination strictly speaking part historical database
many causes addition primary dysautonomia postural syncope due orthostatic hypotension listed table
terms sympathicotonic asympathicotonic coined describe situations autonomic nervous system normal former dysautonomic state exists latter
important point differentiation two groups problems autonomic response system functioning normally sympathicotonic state assumption upright posture accompanied increase heart rate
may perceived reported palpitation
asympathicotonic state heart rate response usually impaired along impairments autonomic function
patient experiences postural symptoms associated orthostatic hypotension describes sensation dizziness transient weakness arising supine position
especially obvious movement sudden
feeling often described though wave weakness passed individual
symptom accompanied shortness breath chest pain
palpitation occur dysautonomic patient
postural syncope resolves quickly head lowered symptom sometimes prevented patient stand slowly enough allow circulatory system adjust
syndrome fully developed however adjustment occur severe syncopal symptoms controlled use support garments therapy expand blood volume
noted symptoms manifestation sudden decrease blood supply brain characteristics transient cerebral ischemia
example patients experience slurring speech dimming vision rather commonly described dizziness
individuals particularly certain drug related secondary dysautonomias symptoms present postexercise syncope weakness rather occurring postural change
times even normal individual experience postural dizziness e g hot day hot bath social drinking
historian must determine whether postural symptoms common occurrence circumstances occur whether events increasing severity frequency symptoms occur association order effectively sort among many varied causes
urinary tract dysfunction described almost two thirds patients primary dysautonomia
symptoms also common individuals secondary dysautonomia particularly diabetics
bladder symptoms nonspecific example nocturnal frequency may part symptom complex due congestive heart failure urinary tract infection bladder outlet obstruction frequent occurrence dysautonomia
could also due osmotic duresis occurs diabetics commonly severe dysautonomia
reasons historian must carefully evaluate individual symptom within complete context
point differential value history pertaining bladder function dysautonomias particularly primary syndromes may accompanied failure bladder sensation well motor function abnormalities
thus dysautonomic patient may aware distended bladder
sensory abnormality help differentiate among causes urinary frequency since osmotic diuresis frequency congestive failure accompanied apparent sense urgency
similarly absence cystic inflammation dysautonomic results frequency without dysuria allowing differentiation urinary tract infection
absence sensation along motor function abnormalities syndrome also make dysautonomic individuals particularly women subject stress overflow incontinence
sexual dysfunction common occurrence dysautonomia may also caused wide variety illnesses table
many years problem written almost always psychogenic origin
recently however organic pharmacologic cause established impotent men organic causes impotence identified
iatrogenic sexual dysfunction caused side effects drugs autonomic nervous system problem special concern
drugs involved particularly anti hypertensive agents needed lifelong treatment important cardiovascular risk factor
occurrence side effects like sexual dysfunction often results noncompliance prescription may seriously impair treatment program
therefore whenever patient known taking drug potential producing side effect possibility explored careful sensitive questioning evidence sexual performance difficulties
discovered drug regimen changed
specific historical points tend suggest dysautonomia organic cause sexual dysfunction
evaluating impotence special clue presence absence morning erection
morning erection frequently experienced event male
tends decline frequency age still occurs even older man
manifestation sympathetic nervous system activity rem sleep cycle true measure competence autonomic nervous system
historian determine whether patient morning erection frequency whether changes character e becoming less turgid occurring
history unclear possible test phenomenon using objective methods nocturnal penile tumescence
another clue differentiation organic psychogenic sexual dysfunction relationship arousal potency specific sexual partners
psychogenic sexual dysfunction often limited specific partner
may manifestation guilt extramarital sexual activity anxiety possible transmission venereal disease may due performance anxiety
organic problems manifested partners
differentiating among many causes organic impotence easy
inflammatory diseases presence pain may provide clue
causes must differentiated evaluation symptom within context entire history
bowel dysfunction seems less often symptomatically disturbing problem dysautonomic patient
may minor changes stool consistency frequency considered abnormal deserving mention patients
since dysautonomias often characteristics sympathetic division dysfunction patient experience increased frequency less solid stool
situation becomes severe may explosive diarrhea
patient may also uncontrollable flatus
since sphincter control lost extremely embarrassing situation sudden stool incontinence may occur
nocturnal diarrhea often present
provides good historic differentiating point organic functional bowel syndromes occur psychogenic functional diarrhea
nocturnal diarrhea particularly common diabetic dysautonomia unique syndrome
abnormalities sweating reported small number patients dysautonomia
often loss sweating involves lower extremities greater extent trunk arms
diabetics distribution areas sweat irregular
failure report symptom mean loss sweating uncommon event dysautonomia
points fact functions autonomic nervous system outside conscious perception
failure functions therefore produce symptoms usual level awareness
aspects activity dysfunction produces either dramatic symptoms postural blood pressure control dysfunction apparent bowel bladder sexual activity symptoms disturbing enough reported
confirmation diagnosis rests physical findings many historic equivalents performance certain objective tests autonomic function

many activities balanced interplay sympathetic parasympathetic divisions necessary
system also functions rapidly responsive reflexes control wide variety physiologic functions
dysautonomia exists system longer functions balanced sufficiently rapid manner
combination imbalance loss responsiveness results emergence symptoms characterize dysautonomic syndromes
noted many activities autonomic system never produce symptoms never appear level patient awareness even functioning abnormally
autonomic nervous system reflexes provide rapidly responsive mechanism moment moment control blood pressure
reflexes critical maintenance adequate blood supply brain individual stands
although vascular system brain capable autoregulation dilate blood pressure falls capability limited blood pressure falls sufficiently brain perfusion
thus orthostatic hypotension drop blood pressure standing accompanied syncope dizziness striking symptoms dysautonomia
baroreceptorcardioaccelerator pressor reflex autonomic mechanism responsible aspect blood pressure control
reflex arc consists several components sensory receptors site integration efferent system effector organ
arterial baroreceptors specialized stretch receptors located walls highly elastic great vessels
commonly described sites receptors carotid sinus aortic arch although sensory receptors probably widely distributed walls major arteries head neck
sensory organs respond stretch exerted elastic vessel wall pulsatile column blood translate distention created energy pulse wave analog signal
travels brain fibers sensory fibers vagus nerve
vasomotor center located pontomedullary portion hindbrain region containing nuclei closely associated reticular activating system
impulse integrating area receives input arterial baroreceptors stimuli arising wide variety sources
sources include higher neurologic sites thalamus hypothalamus cortex well additional peripheral sensory receptors located venous side circulation heart organs tissues
signals sources constantly received provide instantaneous description individual physiologic status integrated vasomotor center ultimately control tonic level impulse activity autonomic system
since system constantly active continuous modulation neural traffic allows instantaneous response changing environment
input arterial baroreceptors inhibitory effect tonic level autonomic cardiovascular activity
blood pressure rises baroreceptors undergo increased stretch increased number neural impulses transmitted
effect increased input vasomotor center twofold increased parasympathetic output heartthis slows heart rate decreased activity sympathetic nervous systemthis also tends slow heart rate important allows relaxation arteriolar resistance blood vessels decreased intensity contraction cardiac musculature
effects result drop blood pressure restoration set point baroreceptors
conversely blood pressure falls baroreceptors send fewer signals
parasympathetic activity decreases allowing heart rate rise
important sympathetic neural impulse activity increases resultant stimulation rate contractility heart constriction arteriolar venous blood vessels
effects serve reverse drop blood pressure
autonomic nervous system classically described operating two neuron efferent system
information integrating centers transmitted within central nervous system via first neuron exits cns reach ganglion synaptic event occurs
actually several neurons intercalated neurons involved transmission process within central nervous system
cell bodies intercalated neurons located intermediolateral columns spinal column cells noted degenerate multiple system atrophy autonomic failure
axons last intercalated cells sympathetic division travel ganglia exiting spinal cord
division exit points spinal cord located thoracolumbar region ganglia located chain close spinal column
ganglionic synaptic transmission one neuron one neuron basis
involves extensive reintegration neural impulses multiple synaptic events individual presynaptic axons stimulate many postsynaptic cell bodies individual postsynaptic cells stimulated many presynaptic transmitter axons
parasympathetic division exit points central nervous system divided two units
majority divisional activity particularly controls heart splanchnic organs travels cranial nerves especially vagus nerve cranial nerve x
second area exit impulses cns located sacral divisions spinal cord
area handles parasympathetic impulses controlling large bowel bladder sexual function
parasympathetic division axonal fibers exiting cns travel way effector organ making synaptic contact second neuron
synaptic interactions take place neural plexi rather consolidated ganglia
acetylcholine synaptic neurotransmitter sympathetic ganglia parasympathetic plexi
autonomic cardiovascular reflexes effector organ entire cardiovascular system
several different portions cardiovascular system respond sympathetic stimulation characteristic manner
sum individual responses produces complete response
venous circulation sympathetic stimulation veins causes constriction
decreases reservoir capacity blood volume immediate result increased volume blood returns heart
increase preload translated increased cardiac output co
arteriolar circulation sympathetic stimulation arterioles causes smooth muscle constriction leads increase peripheral vascular resistance pvr
sensitive arteriolar beds splanchnic organs skin
constriction vascular beds results shift perfusion toward heart brain organs vessels tend respond less arteriolar constrictor stimuli
result effects blood pressure rise blood volume redistributed preserving perfusion vital organs
arteriolar constriction mediated alpha postsynaptic membrane receptor
response predominates vessels skin viscera
striated muscle however arterioles relatively higher concentration beta postsynaptic receptors
mediate vasodilator response stimulated norepinephrine second neuron neurotransmitter sympathetic division
exercise also produces direct vasodilator effect autoregulatory mechanism
balance sympathetic vasoconstriction combined neural autoregulatory vasodilation lost may occur dysautonomia side effect drugs syncope exertion exercise may result
symptom explored history especially individuals receiving guanethedine alpha receptor inhibiting drugs
heart sympathetic stimulation heart causes increase heart rate force ventricular contractility
effects beta receptor mediated responses increase cardiac output
effects increased levels sympathetic stimulation blood pressure predictable based following equation
reflex actions increase either cardiac output co peripheral vascular resistance pvr raise blood pressure
co pvr increased synergistic effect produces even greater effect blood pressure
effects postural change assumption standing posture thus described follows individual stands momentary pooling blood legs splanchnic venous bed result effects gravity column venous blood
sudden drop volume blood returning heart sudden reduction preload causes momentary drop cardiac output blood pressure
occurs single heartbeat time immediately perceived baroreceptors
integrated autonomic response results venoconstriction restoring preload increases rate contractility heart increasing cardiac output constricts arterioles raising blood pressure redistributing arterial blood flow preserve perfusion heart brain
reflex functioning normally systolic blood pressure tends remain slightly lowered compensatory events particularly sensitive effects reduced preload diastolic tends rise reflective increase pvr
absolutely agreed upon normal limits changes
mm hg drop systolic pressure frequently seen mm hg may acceptable symptoms occur
similarly diastolic pressure may rise mm hg may change may even fall mm hg
response still considered normal patient remains asymptomatic
reflex mediated compensatory responses occur patient dysautonomia
patient stands blood pressure falls beyond tolerable limits redistribution perfusion occur
blood supply brain reduced postural syncope results
understanding distribution function sympathetic nervous innervation bladder also helps understand symptoms dysautonomia
sympathetic motor fibers go bladder body relax muscle beta receptor mediation bladder outlet sphincter stimulate constriction alpha receptor mediation
failure entire system would therefore lead spontaneous constriction bladder wall musculature relaxation sphincter
small bladder poor sphincter tone exhibit rapid filling decreased reservoir capacity
frequency incontinence consequences set events
sympathetic innervation also important sexual performance
series events sexual experience dependence normally functioning sympathetic nervous system
arousal visual stimuli fantasy cortical events integrated thalamic hypothalamic impulses appear important sexual interest libido arousal
integrated outflow higher neurologic centers seems involve sympathetic system since many drugs inhibit aspects cns sympathetic function diminish libido experimental study cns sympathetic stimulator yohimbine appears aphrodisiac rats
tumescence actual engorgement genital structures blood mediated sympathetic outflow central nervous system centers spinal reflexes
men potencypenile erection
women tumescence manifested clitoral erection labial engorgement
recruitment secretions testes seminal vesicles prostate mobilized smooth muscle motor propulsive activity ductile structures richly innervated respond sympathetic stimuli
lubrication process involving secretions glandular structures labia vagina probably represents analogous event women
ejaculation reflex event mediated sacral division spinal cord parasympathetic loop rarely ever inhibited dysautonomia drugs
normal anterograde ejaculation however depends adequate closure bladder sphincter
noted sympathetic motor function impaired dysautonomic syndromes particularly diabetes certain drugs
consequence failure sympathetic stimulation cause closure bladder sphincter parasympathetic reflex event ejaculation retrograde ejaculation
even though ejaculatory sensation present failure emit seminal fluid bothersome symptom
sufficiently disquieting patient compromise prescription compliance severely
event women corresponding ejaculation known
muscular contractions vagina uterus occur time climax may mediated parasympathetic reflex system demonstrated
climax autonomic events associated culmination sexual stimulation characteristics generalized discharge sympathetic nervous system
blood pressure rises heart rate rises piloerection occurs etc
drugs inhibit sympathetic outflow described individual patients men women delaying diminishing sensation climax
reports apocryphal studied systematic controlled manner
given wide variety effects sympathetic nervous system sexual performance considering dysautonomia rarely complete many different ways sexual function could disrupted dysautonomic syndromes
literature usually differentiate among effects
often describes failure potency loss libido
illustrated table details effects antihypertensive drugs sexual performance possible differentiate among various aspects sexual failure function probable site autonomic inhibition
approach analysis effects antihypertensives makes apparent impairment central site sympathetic integration leads inhibition potency libido limited effect ejaculation
inhibition neurotransmission peripheral sites ganglion nerve terminal causes impairment potency ejaculation effects libido
note fact beta blockers actions confined peripheral nervous system reported sexual effects propranolol drug class enters cns pattern effect sexual performance similar centrally acting drugs
information effects complete drugs even antihypertensive agents probably studied greatest detail issues systematically examined drug evaluation protocols
nonetheless certain characteristic side effects predictable based site action drug
example shown histamine receptor antagonist cimetidine central nervous system site effect
drug inhibits libido potency pattern side effects exactly would predicted given drug receptor blocking mechanism central nervous system site action

really effective treatment modalities aspects primary dysautonomia
diabetes mellitus probably important systemic illnesses dysautonomia manifestation
diabetic may demonstrate symptoms autonomic nervous system dysfunction early disease process even major changes glucose tolerance developed dysautonomic process may particularly difficult diagnose diabetic often follow classic pattern presentation
example even though pressor component baroreceptor reflex may inhibited cardioaccelerator component often remain intact
asympathicotonic character othostatic hypotension diabetic evident heart rate response postural change persists
diabetic may also demonstrate effects dysautonomia visceral function developing postural blood pressure control problems
thus common diabetic develop nocturnal diarrhea diarrhea alternating constipation manifestation dysautonomic bowel function
impotence retrograde ejaculation also frequently reported
occurrence orthostatic hypotension postural syncope major problem drugs table
side effect make impossible continue use agent therapeutic regimen even producing desired treatment effect risks patient inability patient tolerate problem
list drugs cause postural syncope long varied
produce effect actions autonomic nervous system
others impair autonomic function result diminution circulating blood volume
drugs share common characteristic whether causing autonomic inhibition producing postural symptoms volume depletion reduce cardiac output preload
drugs reduce peripheral vascular resistance e g hydralazine minoxidil cause orthostatic hypotension
important consideration planning change therapy attempt alleviate postural syncope side effect
important consequence side effects probably postural syncope impairment sexual performance per se failure patient remain compliant treatment regimen drug identified cause discomfort
mistrust drugs often carried agents even minor discomforts blamed drug
since drugs needed lifetime treatment patients compliance failure associated unwillingness trust agent become extremely important clinical management problem
secondary dysautonomias relatively uncommon
