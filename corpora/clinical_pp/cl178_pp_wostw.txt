using q tip obtain secretions posterior fournix
prepare wet prep use one two following methods
place sample ml saline agitate mix
take drop mixture place slide
place drop saline slide add small amount discharge
either case cover cover slip
first method preferred discharge profuse dilute secretions individual cells seen better
slide may warmed briefly increase motility trichomonas looked promptly
careful search several fields made medium high power trichomonas clue cells yeast
trichomonas motile flagellated organisms size white blood cell wbc

whiff test test fishy odor occurs bacterial vaginosis previously called gardnerella vaginitis nonspecific vaginitis
drop koh mixed vaginal discharge
positive test abnormal consists characteristic fishy odor
gram stain vaginal discharge done using standard methods
yeast detectable predominant bacterial flora may assessed e g normal gram positive bacilli abnormal gram negative coccobacilli rods
clue cells identified accurately
gram stain endocervical mucous may helpful evaluation cervicitis
gram negative diplococci seen inside cells diagnostic neisseria gonorrhea
relatively insensitive test however substitute culture
excess leukocytes hpf endocervical mucous suggests chlamydial cervicitis appropriate studies obtained
addition information cervical cytology papanicolaou pap smear often add information regarding possible vaginal cervical pathogens
example trichomonas yeast may seen
certain cytologic changes may suggest chlamydial cervicitis
endocervical ectocervical pap smears obtained described chapter
cultures never substitute careful history physical examination microscopic examination wet prep
depending results vaginal culture without microscopic examination secretions result frequent errors treatment
nevertheless cervical cultures may especially helpful cases
yeast grow routine culture well specific media
trichomonas may cultured available laboratories
cervical cultures n
gonorrhea done placing sterile swab endocervical canal
ideally plated specific medium immediately delay decreases yield sharply
chlamydia cultures expensive require week results
recently immunofluorescence techniques become available
less expensive results available sooner
pathologic vaginal discharges caused variety infectious noninfectious causes
discharge may caused infections vagina infections inflammation cervix also lead increase vaginal discharge
many patients one cause present
careful history physical may help separate two conditions point etiology
pelvic examination careful attention paid presence absence cervical inflammation usually manifest edema friability presence absence cervical mucopus mucoprurulent secretions endocervical canal
cervical inflammation mucopus suggest cervicitis cervical infections n
gonorrhea c
trachomatis present without sought appropriate patients
three major causes vaginitis trichomonas candida bacterial vaginosis
distinguished appropriate laboratory tests
trichomonas vaginalis protozoan parasite
grows best moderately anaerobic conditions ph
seen asymptomatic women symptomatic causes white yellow discharge may frothy
classic findings vaginal petechiae relatively uncommon
odor may present
ph usually high greater discharge often contains numerous wbcs
florid cases wet prep reveals numerous motile organisms milder cases careful search many fields must made see one two motile organisms
wet prep sensitive
culture positive patients found wet prep positive cases
although cultures accurate available laboratories
therefore trichomonas ruled patients negative wet prep
pap smears may also reveal trichomonas
discharge large number white blood cells patient cervicitis suggests trichomonas
candida vaginitis may elicit vaginal discharge merely causing vulvar andor vaginal erythema
discharge present usually thick white called cottage cheese
ph normal
abnormal odor whiff test negative
wet prep reveals normal epithelial cells
may small increase number wbcs
bacteria normal lactobacilli
wet prep may reveal yeast budding forms pseudohyphae
potassium hydroxide somewhat sensitive sensitivity varies low series culture positive patients
therefore treatment must often based clinical suspicion alone
candida may grown variety media
cultures accurate microscopic examination alone significance positive culture asymptomatic patient unknown cultures done confirm suspected cases
form vaginitis possibly common
diagnosis made three following four criteria present adherent homogeneous discharge positive whiff test clue cells ph greater
positive whiff test caused aromitization aromatic amines presence koh
gram stain reveal gram negative coccobacilli adherent epithelial cells
wbcs present large numbers coexisting trichomonas cervicitis suspected bacterial vaginosis elicit inflammatory response
one culture gardnerella vaginalis e organism felt least partly responsible disease positive culture diagnostic gardnerella may present small numbers normal women diagnosis rests combination findings
cervicitis may cause purulent discharge cervix
discharge odor consist sheets white blood cells vaginal ph variable
gram stain may reveal gram negative intracellular diplococci n
gonorrhea cause
appropriate tests gonorrhea tests chlamydia must done treatment delayed ascending infection may occur
table
summarizes laboratory data
vaginitis cervicitis extremely common conditions responsible many office visits much discomfort patients
cervicitis may lead serious ascending infections subsequent tubal infertility
accurate prompt diagnosis mandatory
excuse trying diagnose cause vaginal discharge without use laboratory tests
important wet prep allows clinician distinguish three common causes vaginitis
cervicitis may suspected findings physical examination numerous wbcs microscopic examination especially explained trichomonas infection
certain cases screening cultures gonorrhea tests chlamydia done
cases might include women sexually transmitted diseases trichomonas women multiple sexual partners perhaps groups
cultures mandatory women mucoprurulent cervicitis
treatment cause vaginal discharge based clinician feels likely pathogen completion history physical examination examination discharge
correct therapy successful outcome depend accuracy diagnosis
