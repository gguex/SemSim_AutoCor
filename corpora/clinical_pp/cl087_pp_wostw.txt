arthritis may also accompany precede autoimmune hepatitis golding et al
true arthritis may also accompany hemochromatosis although disease rarely causes jaundice bassett et al
bone pain simulating joint pain may accompany long standing cholestatic condition due vitamin depletion calcium deficiency
jaundiced patient requires thorough documentation recent drug toxin exposures
asking list patient drugs physician specifically ask pain relievers tranquilizers birth control pills estrogens patient may forget mention
chemicals especially organic compounds used occupationally home may hepatotoxins
alcohol intake documented preferably estimating number grams ounces alcohol imbibed per day rather number drinks consumed
alcohol abusers often reluctant tell truth habit physician may need talk patient spouse family members friends obtain complete picture
potential contact hepatitis viruses infectious agents also determined
involves asking contacts icteric potentially hepatitic patients recent transfusions needle narcotic use ingestion raw shellfish

splenomegaly frequently found jaundiced patient although specific etiology variable
splenomegaly without hepatomegaly may result primary hemolytic disease especially hereditary spherocytosis portal vein occlusion cause
enlarged spleens commonly result portal hypertension caused liver disease hepatic venous obstruction
instances hypersplenism hemolysis may contribute patient jaundice
splenomegaly due portal hypertension often associated ascites later stages prominent abdominal venous pattern
enlarged spleen may also occur viral hepatitis nonspecific reticuloendothelial response infection

concentrations circulating prothrombin precursor fully functional prothrombin may measured independently
moderately severe hepatocellular disease results reduction proteins extrahepatic obstruction due impairment vitamin k absorption cause fall functional prothrombin alone
prognostically rise precursor concentration indicates return hepatic synthetic capacity even though patient prothrombin time remains abnormal
practice prothrombin time may prolonged seconds control hepatocellular obstructive jaundice
parenteral administration vitamin k mg correct prothrombin time obstructed patient normal within hours hepatocellular icteric patient improve partially
prothrombin time least seconds control jaundiced patient inability correct vitamin k poor prognostic sign
albumin synthesized liver

unconjugated bilirubin limited aqueous solubility therefore transported reticuloendothelial system cells liver reversibly bound albumin
bilirubin may displaced albumin conditions predisposing acidosis hypoxia certain drugs notably salicylates sulfonamides
high plasma levels free fatty acids may also displace bilirubin protein binding sites
circulating unconjugated bilirubin chemically identified indirect fraction van den bergh reaction
within liver bilirubin dissociates albumin hepatocyte membrane transported hepatocyte
although hepatic uptake potential bilirubin rarely utilized capacity therefore rate limiting step elimination reduced hepatic sinusoidal flow limit removal bilirubin circulation contribute clinical jaundice
patients gilbert syndrome see may also component impaired bilirubin uptake
