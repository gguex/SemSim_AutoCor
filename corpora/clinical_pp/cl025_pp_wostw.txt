variety physiologic maneuvers pharmacologic interventions alter cardiovascular hemodynamics used aid characterization differentiation cardiac murmurs
physiologic maneuvers breathing standing sudden squatting isometric hand grip exercise valsalva maneuver passive leg raising attention beat following postextrasystolic pause
breathing produces greater effect right side heart left side
inspiration increases venous return right side heart increasing flow vena cava decreases venous return left side heart due pooling blood pulmonary venous capacitance vessels
effects inspiration systolic murmurs accentuated employing mueller maneuver forced inspiration closed glottis
expiration decreases venous return right side heart reducing vena cava flow increases venous return left side heart due collapse pulmonary venous capacitance vessels
sudden standing sitting recumbent position decreases venous return first right side heart left side heart
results decrease stroke volume chambers
recumbency increases venous return first right left side heart
squatting produces simultaneous increase venous return first right left side heart increase peripheral vascular resistance
results increase systemic blood pressure stroke volume occasionally accompanied reflex bradycardia
isometric hand grip exercise seconds produces increase peripheral vascular resistance systemic blood pressure heart rate cardiac output left ventricular volume left ventricular filling pressure
valsalva maneuver consists four distinct phases
initial phase phase transient increase left ventricular output due increase intrathoracic pressure
strain phase phase decrease venous return first right left side heart
heart rate increases stroke volume mean arterial pressure pulse pressure decrease
release phase phase venous return begins increase
overshoot phase phase venous filling right left ventricles heart rate return normal slightly increased
left sided events generally lag behind right sided events beats
passive leg raising increases venous return first right left side heart
pause following extrasystole usually ventricular premature beat permits increased ventricular filling thus enhancing myocardial contractility
effects physiological maneuvers individual systolic murmurs discussed section entitled clinical significance
pharmacologic interventions used commonly clinical practice amyl nitrite administration intravenous infusion alpha adrenergic agonists phenylephrine methoxamine
inhalation amyl nitrite seconds produces marked decrease peripheral vascular resistance followed increase stroke volume venous return
phenylephrine administered intravenously dosage
mg elevates systolic pressure approximately mm hg minutes
methoxamine administered intravenously dosage mg elevates systolic pressure mm hg minutes
