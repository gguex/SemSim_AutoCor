hearing loss decreased perception loudness andor diminished speech intelligibility
quantitative unit loudness decibel
normal hearing threshold decibels
hearing loss may affect sound perception pure tone loss understanding speech discrimination loss
patients may seek medical help louder perception usually need help speech discrimination
hearing loss may occur abnormality anywhere pinna auditory cortex
proper history examination physician must determine abnormality recommend proper treatment
table
lists causes hearing impairment
questioning determine whether hearing loss seems unilateral bilateral try patient distinguish loss loudness acuity loss speech intelligibility
former category difficult hear latter difficult understand
additional importance whether hearing loss stable progressive fluctuating patient thinks symptom began
detailed review family history deafness childhood ear disease head trauma infection otologic drugs noise exposure surgery must carried
awareness sound function critical one hearing requirements may carefully listener concentrates
loss exceeding decibels db speech frequencies hz unacceptable conversational communication
unilateral hearing loss however even total interfere normal face face communication even though competing noise sound localization problem
hearing loss categorized either conductive sensorineural
next section defines term
discrimination generally unimpaired conductive hearing loss
patient loss note sound dimmed
yet sufficiently amplified clear intelligible
impairment causes patient seem hear better noisy environment
patient loss attenuates background noise would otherwise interfere mask speech wishes hear
opposite true neurally impaired patient
instance environmental noise interferes even normal speech perception
ideal listening conditions quiet environment functional disability sensorineural hearing loss relates frequencies involved quantity frequency
hearing function conveniently considered occurring two phases
phase conductive phase involves collection passage mechanical vibratory sound energy gaseous medium environment fluid medium inner ear
since energy largely reflected interface air water efficient impedance matching system mechanical advantage serves prevent energy loss
system comprises ear canal eardrum attached ossicles
sound curves large amplitude low intensity strike drum must converted transformer mechanism middle ear waves small amplitude low intensity reach footplate stapes
energy transformed fluid bone energy perilymph
traveling waves perilymph move organ corti basilar membrane scala media see illustrated reference myers et al
sound phase sensorineural phase
begins cochlea hair cells corti organ transduce vibratory energy electric potentials
coding loudness pitch occurs
information transmitted via auditory nerve brainstem several intervening nuclear synapses auditory cortex decoding understanding
disease damage sensorineural system reduces loudness distorts sound quality
thus summary hearing loss labeled conductive disease affects phase structures sensorineural affects phase structures
sensorineural loss divided cochlear retrocochlear categories
special audiometric otologic tests enable one differentiate cochlear retrocochlear lesions
differentiation sophisticated requires especially skilled personnel accomplish
however accurate diagnosis requires done locus etiology loss otherwise clear
one thing etiology complications retrocochlear disease tend threatening patient welfare
adult sensorineural loss statistically much common conductive loss
reverse true children adults age
neurally impaired cochlear several times common retrocochlear loss
audible sound spectrum ranges hertz hz
majority human speech sounds bracketed frequencies hz
loss acuity hz often deficit seen early sensorineural lesions generally affect discrimination clarity sound
impairment noted noisy environment
loudness measured decibels
one decibel equals × dynes per square centimeter × dyncm
loudness scale logarithmic
example db tone times energy db tone
thresholds need determined audiometry tuning fork tests used patients indicate conductive sensorineural loss
tests described chapter
loudness threshold least intense sound perceived individual stated differently weakest sound audible patient
standard normal threshold derived testing thousands people
normal arbitrarily considered db kornblut
talk hear
voice monitored ear thus totally deaf patients make distorted speech sounds monitor voice properly
deaf children usually develop normal speech prelingual
adults deafened learning speak postlingual modulate voice better years conditioning
hearing levels greater db child may significantly impair learning development normal living patterns
adequate communication skills needed occupations
patients presenting hearing loss must loss accurately delineated proper history clinical examination audiometry specialized radiologic metabolic immunologic tests
accurate diagnosis permit proper treatment infection impacted cerumen associated allergy arrest progressive disease cholesteatoma acoustic neuroma
virtually hearing loss helped
categorized either conductive sensorineural surgery medical treatment hearing amplification may restore useful hearing
even total sensory inner ear deafness helped cochlear implant
hearing aids produced specifically adapted individual patient hearing loss
dramatic permanent hearing improvement made available tens thousands patients otosclerosis past years stapedectomv surgery
physicians evaluating patients hearing loss must learn proper techniques ear examination including adequate removal wax canal debris permit accurate diagnosis
standard tuning fork tests conducted properly accurately categorize conductive sensorineural loss
hearing loss often present clinical symptoms vertigo headache tinnitus blurred vision facial paralysis
proper investigation ear hearing acuity often help classify symptoms specific disease category
hearing loss progresses rapidly patients age years
population continues grow older physicians larger numbers geriatric patients hearing symptoms
increased awareness use skillful examination techniques become increasingly important primary practitioners caring elderly
