discussion refers anterior two thirds tongue oral tongue visible routine examination
oral tongue moist pink neither localized diffuse discoloration ulceration
filiform fungiform circumvallate papillae visible
normally thin coat
first examine tongue within oral cavity
confirm presence three types lingual papillae
check carefully unusual size coat
coat best evaluated posterior two thirds oral tongue
search areas ulceration discoloration
patient protrude tongue
briefly repeat examination also evaluate range anterior tongue thrust
refer additional comments chapter oral cavity associated structures chapter cranial nerve xii hypoglossal nerve
important disease tongue cancer
technique examining tongue cancer described chapter
oral portion tongue derives first branchial arch
skeletal muscles tongue covered mucous membrane containing three types papillae humans
filiform papillae multiple small structures dorsum tongue
fungiform papillae slightly redder nearer surface numerous tip margins tongue
circumvallate papillae number larger lie junction oral pharyngeal tongue
tongue functions assist taste mastication deglutition speech
type papilla houses taste buds convey different tastes sweet sour bitter salty
specialized techniques beyond physical examination necessary evaluation taste
many references made coat tongue
one interpretation formation coat dying stratified squamous epithelial cells become hydrated white
thickness coat largely dependent upon balance rate production epithelial cells rate dead ones worn away activity eating talking
disease interferes proliferation cells hydrated dead epithelial cells tongue replaced fast wear coat
cellular proliferation normal usual removal processes decrease thick coat
past tongue major object interest many adult patients reflexly stick tongues soon examiner displays flashlight tongue blade
focus evolved largely determine coat thick patient coatless beefy red tongue
since major wear comes eating talking thick coat indicates patient neither eating talking much therefore must sick
since patient already knows observation adds little
standard descriptions tongue pernicious anemia beefy red sore smooth papillary atrophy
description covers two separate developments rare nowadays
inflammation tongue redness soreness may occur time vitamin b folic acid deficiency
usually transitory seldom seen
atrophy papillae resulting smooth tongue late development
diagnosis nearly always made much earlier
much likely cause smooth tongue false teeth
important deficiency folic acid vitamin b severe enough produce anemia coat tongue may appear quite normal otherwise
tongue severely affected vitamin deficiencies
much less common since advent fortified foods
vitamin deficiency occur likely multiple
therefore distinction black tongue niacin deficiency pellagra magenta tongue riboflavin deficiency likely diagnostic importance
deficiencies niacin riboflavin pyridoxine folic acid vitamin b resulting poor diet administration antagonists may cause sore beefy red tongue without coat
chronic vitamin deficiency state tongue may become atrophic smooth
chronic iron deficiency may also lead atrophic smooth tongue
buccal mucosa may participate inflammatory reaction due vitamin deficiency
increasingly common cause acutely sore ulcerated mouth tongue administration anticancer drugs methotrexate antagonizes folic acid fluorouracil directly interferes production dna therefore proliferation cells
vitamin deficiency particularly riboflavin also cause cheilosis fissuring corners mouth
common cause cheilosis however drooling occasioned excessive folding corners mouth elderly patients dentures atrophy gums
patients receiving antibiotics chronic basis particularly immunocompetence depressed disease immunosuppressive drugs particularly likely develop moniliasis stomatitis
characterized snowy white fungal patches
prolonged penicillin use lead infection aspergillus niger characteristic painless brown black hairy tongue long thickened fused papillary tufts
another lead systemic disease examination tongue macroglossia
examined visually also palpation
true macroglossia elevate tongue bulge beneath mandible displacing sublingual glands
finding may obvious major clue amyloidosis
macroglossia may also occur acromegaly myxedema rather unimportant finding among many manifestations diseases
minor abnormalities tongue deserve mention
anomaly significance furrows tongue deeper usual without disturbance arrangement papillae
called furrowed scrotal tongue
another abnormality called geographic tongue areas atrophy filiform papillae normal fungiform papillae
areas separated white lines hypertrophied filiform papillae
patches may wander remain static
condition usually appears early life obscure etiology
