respiratory system major functions provide adequate oxygen supply meet energy production requirements body maintain suitable acid base status removing carbon dioxide co body
accomplished moving varying volumes air lungs
ventilation process air movement lungs carefully controlled modality wide range response enables markers gas exchange adequacy pao paco ph kept within relatively small physiologic range
maintain accurate control respiratory system central respiratory pacemaker located within medulla brainstem
neural output travels center spinal cord muscles respiration
changes effected two groups muscles inspiratory expiratory contract relax produce rhythmic respiratory rate pattern
individuals unchanging metabolic demand rate pattern surprisingly constant interrupted every several minutes larger inspiratory effort sigh
ventilation rest individuals requires inspiratory muscles
expiration usually passive secondary respiratory system returning resting state
therefore quiet breathing inspiratory time period active respiratory pacemaker output
adjusting rate length intensity neural output pacemaker lead changes breaths per minute volume inspiration tidal volume
final outputs respiratory pacemaker rate tidal volume two components ventilation
expiratory muscles begin play role disease increased ventilatory demands
occurs length time takes empty lungs adequately also lead changes rate tidal volume
minute ventilation product rate tidal volume
important differentiate effect changes rate tidal volume gas exchange
given tidal volume divided two components
one part dead space
portion volume moved lungs ventilation come contact functioning pulmonary capillaries
example air end inspiration reaches trachea bronchi capillaries
since air blood interface reach circulation co removed
component called alveolar volume
part tidal breath enters air spaces lung perfused functioning capillaries
normal individuals air spaces terminal respiratory unit include respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts alveolar sacs alveoli
alveolar volume component tidal breath contributes gas exchange rest really wasted ventilation
minute ventilation increased making tidal volume larger greater effect gas exchange minute ventilation reached increasing rate
medullary respiratory control center pacemaker receives three kinds feedback
impulses integrated within control center
output respiratory center altered timing intensity leading changes rate tidal volume
three kinds feedback chemical mechanical input higher cortical centers
normal individual able keep pao paco ph within narrow limits
order accomplish level control respiratory center receives input peripheral central chemoreceptors
major peripheral receptors located within carotid bodies found bifurcation common carotid artery
also similar structures aorta less known aortic bodies
afferent limb receptors responds pao ph changes
efferent limb produces changes minute ventilation respiratory control center
response changing pao levels detected high mm hg pao level resulting change rate volume small
pao drops mm hg much greater important respiratory response large increases minute ventilation mm hg change pao
carotid body also responds small changes ph approximately two thirds response ph result central chemoreceptors
response carotid bodies paco secondary changes ph resulting paco change
medullary chemoreceptor located ventral surface medulla
receptor responds changes ph important receptor regarding respiratory changes acid base alterations
responds changes cerebrospinal fluid rather blood sensitive small changes hydrogen ion concentration cerebrospinal fluid
since co rapidly crosses blood brain barrier rapidly alters ph spinal fluid
increase mm hg pco cerebrospinal fluid leads increased ventilation liters per minute
medullary chemoreceptor also adjusts respiratory response altered ph secondary metabolic acidosis alkalosis
slower equilibration hydrogen bicarbonate across blood brain barrier however changes quick rapid respiratory changes produced change pco
another neural input respiratory pacemaker comes receptors lung related mechanical properties lung
individual elected breathe rate breaths per minute large tidal volume would efficient gas exchange ratio dead space tidal volume would low
larger inspiratory lung volume however greater becomes elastic recoil lung
greater lung volumes chest wall elasticity also added must overcome
therefore larger inspiratory lung volume greater inspiratory pressure needed overcome elastic recoil expand lung
greater inspiratory pressure greater work breathing respiratory muscles
respiratory system appears choose rate requires least amount mechanical work maintaining adequate gas exchange
wide range tidal volumes mechanical limitation comes effect appear lower limits rates tolerated required increase inspiratory work
receptors lung appear contribute inspiratory limitation
one group stretch receptors
efferents increase neural output larger given lung volume becomes
animals reflexes important normal humans appear less important easily overcome neural inputs
output receptors however limit degree inspiration means hering breur reflex
probably disease states reflex plays important role limiting inspiration
lung parenchymal receptors may play role limiting size tidal volume juxtapulmonary capillary receptors j receptors
receptors fire pulmonary capillaries distended
final modulator central respiratory drive input higher centers
example state awake associated important neural inputs respiratory center play large role determining individual respiratory rate pattern
individual falls asleep cortical input decreases respiratory center output
nondreaming non rapid eye movement sleep input chemical receptors becomes increasingly important
absent apnea may result
sleep associated rapid eye movements dreaming breathing patterns may related contents dreams reflect input higher cortical centers
higher center input also accounts hyperventilation associated anxiety behavioral factors
three types input integrated medullary respiratory center lead changes minute ventilation
changes seen changes rate volume

demonstrates factors may interrelate normal individuals
ventilation minute minute ventilation liters done rate breaths tidal volume cc would alveolar ventilation
normal dead space consisting trachea bronchi cc
even rate slowed breaths per minute result would alveolar ventilation
l
would inadequate meet co production would lead elevation paco lowering ph
central peripheral chemoreceptors would stimulated
might also concomitant fall pao would lead increased neural output carotid bodies
result increase input central center would alteration rate pattern breathing
third breathing alternative would choosing respiratory rate per minute
would give extremely efficient breath little wasted dead space
problem large volume would require increased work breathing stimulate stretch receptors
therefore unless constant conscious effort maintained respiratory central center would inhibit inspiratory effect reaching tidal volumes liters
furthermore efficient gas exchange could lead lowered paco
resulting increased ph would produce less drive breathe lower minute ventilation
best alternative normal individual would choose intermediate rate breaths per minute
example breaths per minute would meet metabolic needs effectively
normal individuals multiple factors affect respiratory rate pattern rest
normal people also must adjust changing metabolic demands seen exercise
using input various receptors respiratory center finely adjusts rate pattern keep pao ph within relatively small range spite increased metabolic demands times needs rest
altered respiratory rate pattern often accompany variety disease states
diseases frequently lead alterations one three kinds feedback central respiratory control center control center
example pathological conditions altering pao paco ph obviously alter input carotid body medullary chemoreceptors
usual response altered chemoreceptor input first change tidal volume followed change respiratory rate
therefore lung diseases cause acute hypoxemia level lower mm hg usually produce increased ventilation
response increasing paco lowered ph produce rapid changes minute ventilation also stimulating chemoreceptors
elevation paco always associated expected increase minute ventilation however
elevation paco lead co narcosis depression respiratory center
metabolic acidosis contrast likely increase ventilation predominantly increasing tidal volume
kussmaul respiration classic pattern seen diabetic ketoacidosis consists slow deep breaths reflect increased tidal volume actual slowing rate
occurrence respiratory compensation metabolic change may slowed cerebrospinal fluid changes lag behind blood changes
acute ph drop blood stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors leading hyperventilation acutely lowering paco
lead lowered pco cerebrospinal fluid
since hydrogen ion associated metabolic acidosis cross blood brain barrier immediately medullary chemoreceptors may initially reduce respiration reduced pco make cerebrospinal fluid alkalotic
matter hours spinal fluid ph decreased appropriate response occur
ventilation also slowed metabolic alkalosis
change may detectable routine physical examination
nevertheless also lead enough slowing paco becomes markedly elevated
mechanical properties also altered diseases
interstitial disease probably enhances stretch receptor response leading rapid shallow ventilation
efficient lung interstitial disease less compliant requiring distending pressure per unit volume normal
breathing lower tidal volumes work breathing diminished
congestive heart failure produce similar effect
partly related reduced compliance also may result stimulation j receptors lie right next capillaries
respiratory center feedback higher cortical centers also modulated diseases
anxiety increase respiratory rate pattern
acute hyperventilation syndrome example drive higher centers maintain high minute ventilation face elevated ph
increased intracranial pressure leads rapid deep breathing pattern
pattern frequently seen head trauma
pain contributes rapid respiratory rate
fractured rib produces pain inspiration therefore leads low volume rapid rate pattern
tachypnea commonly part chest pain partly modulated higher cortical input
central controlling center affected directly
central nervous system depressing drug reduce respiratory rate pattern
also blunt response neural inputs
patient obstructive lung disease receives narcotic frequently elevate paco even
true many drug overdoses
central nervous system depressed drugs depression respiratory center leads co retention
changing rate pattern respiration often suggest localization cns changes
understanding areas brain involved specific patterns come animal studies
lesions cuts made various parts brain lead specific breathing patterns
transection pons affect normal breathing vagi intact
vagi cut however larger tidal volumes slower rate observed
midpons transection lead maintenance spontaneous breathing slow regular pattern
vagi cut apneustic breathing occurs
sustained inspiratory spasm
pontomedullary junction transection lead irregular ataxic breathing pattern

one aspect respiratory pattern must considered
coordination chest wall abdomen
normal individuals contract diaphragm external intercostal muscles inspiration
physical examination action inspiratory muscle actions determined
diaphragm contracting normally moves abdominal contents downward outward
figure
represented upward deflection abdominal curve
physical examination felt anterior movement abdomen
major groups inspiratory muscles external intercostals move chest wall outward
also determined feeling anterior movement chest wall inspiration reflected figure upward deflection
normal persons therefore coordinated movement chest wall abdomen moving outward inspiration inward expiration
alterations pattern allow diagnosis changing respiratory muscle contribution tidal breath
paralysis intercostals results cervical spinal cord injury
group patients physical exam paradoxical movement chest wall inward abdomen outward inspiration figure
reflects passive movement chest wall
pattern results tidal breath produced diaphragmatic contraction
diaphragmatic paralysis diagnosed suggested inward movement diaphragm inspiration
movement accentuated supine position
position diaphragmatic contraction produces approximately two thirds inspiratory volume compared one third upright position
diaphragmatic dysfunction also diagnosed finding paradoxical inward abdominal movement inspiration
pattern respiration seen individuals severe emphysema air trapping
air trapping leads low flat diaphragm
diaphragm longer contract effectively
inability contract demonstrated inward inspiratory movement abdomen
movement results ineffective diaphragm pulled thorax inspiration
breathing pattern reported predictive value impending respiratory failure
another value determining changes chest wall abdominal breathing patterns seen individuals weaned mechanical ventilation
develop respiratory alternans pattern
series tidal breaths alternates short period abdominal inward movement inspiration followed period chest wall inward movement inspiration
demonstrated associated fatigue indicates weaning stopped
understanding respiratory rate pattern important addition dealing many respiratory cardiac neurological diseases
nevertheless understanding role rate tidal volume also essential managing individuals requiring mechanical ventilation
one clinical situation physician directly manipulate respiratory rate pattern produce appropriate arterial blood gases
sum alveolar volume one minute alveolar ventilation inversely related paco
hyperventilation reduces paco leading decreased respiratory drive patient trigger ventilator
hypoventilation produces co retention increased respiratory drive patient
leads either rapid ventilation rates triggered patient patient demonstrating marked discomfort
consideration dead space important
diseases increase dead space reducing capillary bed
therefore larger tidal volumes may necessary get adequate gas exchange
finally volumes large lead asychrony patient tries start next breath ventilator ready
may relate stretch receptor responses fatiguing inefficient mode gas exchange
