fourth heart sound low pitched sound coincident late diastolic filling ventricle due atrial contraction
thus occurs shortly first heart sound
although also called atrial sound production requires effective atrial contraction fourth heart sound result vibrations generated within ventricle
commonly presence indicates increased resistance filling left right ventricle reduction ventricular wall compliance accompanied disproportionate rise ventricular end diastolic pressure
patients fourth heart sound palpable correlate often present concomitant brief presystolic outward movement chest wall
fourth heart sound detected occasionally inspection commonly palpation auscultation depicted graphically phonocardiographic recording
evaluation fourth heart sound arising left ventricle readily carried patient left lateral recumbent position
inspection palpation employed first identify apex impulse fourth heart sound usually prominent
techniques used identify site careful auscultation
instead often permit detection fourth heart sound palpable visible correlates reflect late diastolic presystolic left ventricular motion
described later chapter presence palpable fourth heart sound greatly enhances clinical significance
presystolic outward movement cardiac apex felt lightly applied fingers hand
visible appearance enhanced shining light tangentially cardiac apex taping end small stick apical area
fourth heart sound low frequency best heard bell stethoscope placed lightly chest wall
though often soft prominent cardiac apex left ventricular fourth heart sound sufficient intensity heard precordial areas
fourth heart sound typically dull thudding quality suppressed applying firm pressure stethoscope bell
latter characteristic aid distinguishing fourth heart sound split first heart sound higher frequency readily heard firmly applied bell diaphragm stethoscope
distinction made fact split first heart sound generally detected widely precordium remains well heard patient assumes sitting standing position
maneuvers heighten resistance left ventricular ejection e g isometric hand grip exercise typically enhance intensity left sided fourth heart sounds
fourth heart sound arising right ventricle best heard bell stethoscope placed lower left sternal border subxiphoid area
sounds arising right side heart intensity sound may transiently increased inspiration consequence enhanced right atrial filling
often right ventricular fourth heart sound accompanied prominent wave jugular venous pulse
concert first second heart sounds pathologic fourth heart sound yields characteristic auscultatory cadence resembles canter horse hence designation pathologic fourth heart sound atrial gallop actually misnomer since sound originates ventricle
rapid heart rates diastole foreshortened may difficult impossible distinguish fourth heart sound gallop third heart sound gallop occurring rapid filling phase
moreover third fourth heart sounds present sinus tachycardia near simultaneous occurrence result loud single summation gallop
patients tachycardia carotid sinus massage assuming contraindication use may permit distinction third fourth heart gallop sounds transiently slowing heart rate
sinus rhythm two phases diastolic filling ventricles
first rapid filling phase occurs passively upon opening atrioventricular valves
second occurs late ventricular diastole result atrial contraction
latter active phase ventricular filling fourth heart sound associated
although mandatory relationship fourth heart sound vigorous atrial contraction recognized hundred years mechanism sound production established
clear sound arises low frequency hz vibrations generated within ventricle produced proposed sudden deceleration active blood flow ventricular wall
follows conditions leading increased stiffness ventricular wall hence greater ventricular resistance inflow favor development fourth heart sound
indeed reduced ventricular compliance occurs example left ventricular hypertrophy ischemia important clinical implication pathologic fourth heart sound
setting delivery atrial component filling nondistensible ventricle results abnormally increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure
however elevation diastolic pressure confined late diastole large presystolic wave ventricular pressure curve
function reduced ventricular compliance necessarily imply reduced systolic function ventricle cardiac failure
delivery atrial component filling noncompliant ventricle leads also enhanced presystolic left ventricular motion may reflected palpable presystolic movement precordium increased amplitude wave recorded graphically apex cardiogram
patients normally compliant ventricles presystolic ventricular motion accompanying atrial contraction generally felt bedside
since genesis fourth heart sound requires effective atrial contraction occur patients atrial fibrillation
also required production fourth heart sound relatively free flow blood atrioventricular valve
thus left right sided fourth heart sound occur patients advanced mitral tricuspid stenosis respectively
significance physical findings must assessed context occur
particularly true fourth heart sound considerable controversy prevalence older individuals clinically apparent cardiovascular disease
many renowned clinicians classically considered fourth heart sound unequivocally abnormal finding patients age
others particularly past decade provided data supporting common presence fourth heart sound healthy individuals age years
proposed greater prevalence fourth heart sounds otherwise normal older individuals may reflect physiologic decrease ventricular compliance aging
issue clouded finding blinded clinical trials considerable disagreement among experienced examiners presence absence audible fourth heart sound individual subjects
controversy clinical significance fourth heart sound may result part diligence sound sought e intensity distinction audible versus phonocardiographically recordable fourth heart sounds latter clearly found many normal older people
thus bedside assessment individual patient clinician must consider patient age presence absence abnormal signs intensity fourth heart sound
clinical significance audible fourth heart sound greatly strengthened presence concomitant palpable presystolic precordial movement palpable fourth heart sound
prominent audible palpable fourth heart sound almost always abnormal finding
described basic science section pathologic fourth heart sound usually indicates reduced ventricular compliance
commonly results conditions lead ventricular hypertrophy
left sided fourth heart sound frequently present patients systemic hypertension aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathv
left ventricular fourth heart sound common also patients coronary heart disease
decrease ventricular compliance result prior myocardial infarction acute ischemia
fourth heart sound may become evident intensity may augmented episodes angina pectoris
fourth heart sound almost universal finding early stages acute myocardial infarction patient sinus rhythm
fourth heart sound occur without signs heart failure
per se indicate cardiac decompensation
right ventricular fourth heart sounds occur clinical situations compliance chamber reduced
hence significant pulmonic valve stenosis pulmonary arterial hypertension typically accompanied right ventricular fourth heart sound
fourth heart sound always indicate reduced ventricular compliance
fourth heart sound also result filling nondilated normally compliant ventricle markedly enhanced patients anemia thyrotoxicosis acute mitral regurgitation
prolongation atrioventricular conduction also promote presence audible fourth heart sound results atrial contraction temporally separated distinct first heart sound
