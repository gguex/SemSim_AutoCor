clinicians need basic understanding awareness nutrition order optimally promote health maintenance prevent disease facilitate recovery illness augment treatment medical surgical disease states
awareness application nutrition medical practice major impact health care society
detailed nutritional history necessary patient evaluations
nevertheless important clinician cognizant clues routine history physical examination laboratory data prompt inquiry specific nutritional habits assessment selective examination laboratory studies
intent section review methods clinical assessment leading various diagnoses crohn disease hypertension alcoholism nontropical sprue pernicious anemia
diagnoses become evident appropriate evaluation
point nutrition related diagnoses entertained however consideration nutritional disorders selective nutritional history important
addition society adopted varied nutritional habits certain questions part routine evaluation
delineated table
malnutrition particularly protein calorie type prevalent among hospitalized patients
anthropometric measurements laboratory determinations provide objective information nutritional status malnutrition identified skilled physician using clinical judgment
malnutrition considered patients recently lost spouse recent weight loss institutionalized chronic lung disease alcoholism cancer residual manifestations stroke
protein deficiency evident potential problem conditions
cases assessment daily protein intake important
although dietician helpful determining precise dietary intakes various nutrients reasonable estimate protein intake made using simple guidelines
knowledge major sources protein protein content allows rapid reasonable estimate dietary protein
table
lists approximate values protein foods
approximations protein intake readily assessed
recommended dietary allowance protein
gkg body weight per day maintenance
requirement increases conditions stress catabolism
patients consuming less g protein per day estimate may getting adequate protein
eating habits dietary patterns influenced many factors
ambulatory patients nutritional problems weight loss may experiencing difficulties unrelated disease
may difficulty obtaining preparing foods may problem related chewing swallowing food may underlying depression lack social interaction
factors reduce voluntary intake remediable considered patients suspected nutritional problems
key diagnosis treatment nutritional disorders awareness
physician think nutrition reviewing medications making clinical evaluations formulating treatment plans patients certain chronic diseases recovering major illnesses
process physician likely discover nutritional factors may profound impact health care
table
lists diagnoses clinical situations nutritional evaluation may indicated
considerable variation dietary habits composition individuals cultural populations
despite broad range food sources basic required elements found majority dietary patterns
basic compounds required diet optimal growth proper metabolism maintenance tissues avoidance recovery certain disease states
compounds include fat protein vitamins minerals trace elements water fiber adequate calories
fat important source calories kcalg carrier fat soluble vitamins also required essential fatty acid efa linoleic acid
although efa deficiency rare circumstances develop
body stores fat containing linoleic acid fasting moderate lengths time result efa deficiency
nevertheless patients maintained fat free parenteral nutrition may develop efa deficiency either positive caloric balance preventing mobilization fat stores total parenteral nutrition prolonged period
prevent efa deficiency requires approximately calories come linoleic acid
provision ml intravenous lipid emulsion weekly intervals adequate patients receiving total parenteral nutrition
hypercholesterolemia particularly conjunction decreased high density lipoprotein fraction strongly correlated coronary artery disease
presence heart disease family history heart disease family history blood lipid disorder prompt questioning laboratory lipid profile evaluation
dietary measures reduce serum cholesterol include reduction total fat intake increase ratio polyunsaturated saturated fats diet possibly increase dietary fiber chromium
specific amino acids required protein synthesis maintain tissues provide necessary enzymes allow continuous protein turnover
essential amino acids must provided diet concurrently order utilized
include phenylalanine valine tryptophan threonine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine
deficiency one essential amino acids impairs effective protein synthesis
certain foods contain complete well balanced proteins high biological value
generally animal origin include milk eggs fish chicken pork beef
foods legumes rice wheat corn contain essential amino acids must combined complementary manner consumed foods containing complete proteins
unbalanced vegetarian diet may lead protein deficiency total vegetarian diet fully adequate concepts understood followed
protein deficiency result severe self imposed diets certain fad diets alcoholism cachexia associated cancer conditions eating difficult dysphagia severe emphysema peridontal disease eating disorders anorexia nervosa
protein deficiency suspected brief dietary history described technique section may reveal inadequate intake
consultation dietician may beneficial well assessment nutritional status anthropometric measurements serum transferrin albumin total lymphocyte count
availability common usage vitamin supplements important question patients whether take vitamins
although use daily multiple vitamin mineral supplements generally innocuous use megadose supplements increasingly common potentially hazardous
fat soluble vitamins accumulate likely water soluble vitamins cause problems prolonged excessive consumption
toxicity active vitamin retinoids may develop intakes iu daily several months
result headaches hair loss skin exfoliation bone pain irritability anorexia hepatomegaly pseudotumor cerebri
carotene provitamin form vitamin found dark green yellow vegetables relatively harmless
excess consumption results hypercarotenosis yellowing skin
vitamin toxicity may develop intakes excess iu daily several months
consequences include fatigue mental status changes constipation features associated hypercalcemia
addition hypercalciuria result dehydration kidney stone formation renal failure
although water soluble vitamins excess less likely cause problems clinically significant manifestations
excessive vitamin c ascorbic acid promote formation kidney stones large doses acutely cause gastrointestinal disturbances
human studies indicate mg daily results saturation greater doses resulting decreased absorption increased excretion potential transient deficiency state intake reduced recommended levels
vitamin b pyridoxine reported cause unusual neuropathy chronic high doses
niacin large doses may cause gastrointestinal disturbances including liver dysfunction
supplementation minerals trace elements result significant imbalance nutrients
excessive quantities one substance antagonize another essential nutrient
chronic excessive zinc intake produce copper deficiency high manganese intake impairs absorption iron
examples known potentially detrimental effects high intakes specific minerals
likely isolated increased intake minerals trace elements could adverse effects
key moderation use pharmacologic doses minerals absence demonstrated deficiency discouraged
nutrition plays major role health prevention disease recovery illness
