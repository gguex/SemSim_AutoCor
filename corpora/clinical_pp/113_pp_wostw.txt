conjugate gaze right example depends upon simultaneous equal innervation right lateral rectus left medial rectus muscles
gaze right accomplished similar innervational activity right superior rectus left inferior oblique muscles
pairs eye muscles yoke move eyes conjugately
one two yoke muscles lags behind move eye images fall corresponding retinal points retinal correspondence absent images become disparate diplopia results
thus double vision represents situation retinal images fused disparate points retina simultaneously stimulated
several questions help examiner accurately localize weak eye muscle patient complains double vision
first question functionally differentiates whether paretic muscle acts predominantly horizontal vertical plane two images side side top
side side separation betrays presence lateral medial rectus dysfunction vertical diplopia implicates vertically acting eye muscle
second determine whether double vision worse gaze right left
horizontal separation images becomes worse left gaze implies paresis either left lateral rectus right medial rectus muscle since double vision always worse field action weakened muscle
third ask whether double vision worse near distance
horizontal diplopia worse left gaze distance fixation suggests limitation left lateral rectus movement
horizontal diplopia worse near e g reading right medial rectus would culpable since near vision task like reading requires convergence active medial rectus contraction
vertical separation images near right suggests left superior oblique paresis
meticulous history taking asking pertinent questions related disposition double images various positions gaze examiner gain wealth information actual evaluation eye movements
furthermore observe position patient head face chin since many forms diplopia may totally eliminated compensatory head posture
right lateral rectus paralyzed turning head right produces lateral rotation eyes left ocular fixation maintained
since right eye taken field action paretic right lateral rectus muscle single vision achieved
face turning right left helps reduce horizontal separation images
face rotation used correct vertical separation images
patient rotates face direction maximum pull muscle eyes deviate opposite direction therefore field action paretic muscle
thus right superior rectus palsy superior rectus acts primarily elevate eye abduction face turns right
throws eyes relatively left position away field action right superior rectus
head tilting lessens torsional component diplopia
superior oblique muscle weakness instance produces diplopia two images separated vertically
false image also angulated
superior oblique strong intorter muscle weakness cause affected eye relatively extorted thus projected image eye intorted relative image opposite eye
patient weak right superior oblique muscle looks straight horizontal line false image right eye true image also bent right side tilted
correct vertical separation images patient rotates face downward correct torsional component patient tilts head left shoulder
evokes right eye extorsion movement dependent right superior oblique
patients enter office heads tilted away weakened superior oblique sign strong localizing value evaluation vertical diplopia
monocular diplopia never related neurologic disturbance ocular motility

eye moved six extraocular muscles four rectus muscles superior inferior lateral medial two oblique muscles superior inferior
primary muscles move eye horizontally medial lateral recti
lateral rectus muscle runs apex orbit lateral side orbit abducts globe
medial rectus inserts opposite side eye principal action adduction figure
superior rectus muscle runs apex orbit anteriorly temporally inserts eye mm behind upper limbus figure
eye primary position muscle plane superior rectus forms angle degrees visual axis
eye abducted degrees superior rectus fibers parallel visual axis superior rectus elevates globe
anterior pole eye abducted visual axis eye stands less perpendicular insertion superior rectus superior rectus adducts intorts globe
intorsion inwardly rotation eye around longitudinal axis
inferior rectus muscle runs orbital apex globe anteriorly temporally parallel superior rectus muscle inserts mm behind lower limbus
relationship muscle plane visual axis identical superior rectus
abduction inferior rectus depresses globe secondary actions include excyclotorsion adduction
superior oblique muscle also originates orbital apex figure runs medially anteriorly tendon inserts pulley trochlea
tendon courses posteriorly temporally forms angle degrees visual axis insert posterior part upper surface eye
visual axis parallel direction pulling tendon maximal adduction approximately degrees superior oblique depresses globe elevating posterior pole eye
eye primary position principal action superior oblique one incyclotorsion whereas abduction secondary action
inferior oblique originates anteromedial part orbital floor
runs parallel tendon superior oblique globe insert posterior inferior lateral surface eye
eye adducted inferior oblique pulls posterior pole thus elevating cornea
primary position secondary actions include excycloorsion abduction
therefore four muscles move eye vertical direction
eye adducted inferior oblique moves eye upward superior oblique moves downward eye abduction superior rectus functions elevator inferior rectus depressor
positions gazestraight straight oblique movements globeresult simultaneous action two eye muscles
besides horizontal vertical eye movement globes rotate around longitudinal axis two superiors superior rectus superior oblique inward rotators intorters two inferiors inferior rectus inferior oblique outward rotators extorters
actions become important normal vestibular eye movement also explain subjective complaints offered patients weakness torsional eye muscle
instance normal eye maintains accurate fixation head tilted one shoulder intorsion ipsilateral eye extorsion contralateral eyeall part doll eye reflex
patient right fourth nerve palsy weakness right superior oblique muscle complain seeing two images one tilted away
torsional tilting component diplopia becomes obvious patient tilts head right shoulder maneuver intorts right eye accentuates weakness right superior oblique muscle
term paralysis means complete absence eye muscle activity paresis refers incomplete movement palsy encompasses either paralysis paresis
remember diplopia always greatest field action weakened eye muscle
mild left lateral rectus paresis may double vision patient looks straight ahead right
left gaze evokes contraction left lateral rectus muscle evoke diplopia greater degrees left gaze evoke greater diplopia false image projected farther away fovea figure
case left lateral rectus weakness patient see two images left gaze outside false image disappear occlusion left eye
red glass held one eye enables patient differentiate easily two images manner one image red white
false image always projected outside true image
patient right superior rectus palsy greatest vertical separation images patient looks right since right superior rectus greatest action eye position gaze
right eye fails elevate fully position fixational target projects back right eye macula image seen fixation outside true image fixating left eye
orthophoria means straightness eyes fixation distance near objects
orthophoria present deviation either eye covered
heterophoria condition eyes appear straight eyes fixating soon eye covered deviates behind cover
condition ocular fusional power sufficient keep eyes straight binocular fixation decompensates fusion broken e one eye covered
esophoria indicates tendency covered eye deviate inward exophoria means eye deviates outward hyperphoria indicates tendency covered eye higher fellow hypophoria means covered eye assumes lower position
patients phorias straight eyes eyes open
ocular deviation becomes evident fusion interrupted covering one eye
tropia manifest deviation present eyes open
heterotropia small patient may complain diplopia yet eyes appear straight primary position routine testing eye movements give normal results
cases coveruncover test proves useful
patient asked fixate eyes open
occluder moved slowly one eye examiner observes fixating uncovered eye
shows movement eye obviously maintaining fixation binocular conditions
uncovered eye moves take fixation heterotropia present
movement fixating eye downward called hypertropia upward hypotropia inward exotropia outward esotropia
eye must covered turn examiner inspects fellow eye
performance test yields heterotropia measured positions gaze determine eye muscle weak
prisms utilized purpose
deviation greatest field action weakened muscle
according hering equal simultaneous innervation flows synergistic yoke muscles
left gaze instance symmetric innervation right medial left lateral rectus muscles
greatest practical significance hering law application diagnosis paralytic strabismus
since amount innervation flowing eyes always determined fixating eye angle deviation vary depending upon whether patient fixates sound eye paretic eye
thus measurements deviation positions gaze eye fixating turn paramount importance detecting paretic muscle muscle groups
take case right lateral rectus palsy
right gaze normal innervational activity adducts left eye paretic right eye fully abduct right lateral rectus weakness
amount lateral deviation paretic eye makes attempted right gaze sound eye fixating called primary deviation
right lateral rectus weakness primary deviation relatively small
paretic right eye forced fixate occluding left eye right lateral rectus receives extra boost innervational activity
since enhanced amount innervational stimulation fed yoke muscles left medial rectus deviates far medial necessary
amount deviation sound eye makes paretic eye forced fixate called secondary deviation
paralytic strabismus secondary deviation always greater primary deviation
measuring primary secondary deviation various positions gaze even small amounts diplopia diagnosed
