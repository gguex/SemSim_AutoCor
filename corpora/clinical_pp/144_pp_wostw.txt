pituitary secretion acth adrenocorticotropic hormone regulates adrenal steroidogenesis stimulating synthesis release cortisol major glucocorticoid adrenal androgens aldosterone potent mineralocorticoid
cortisol exerts negative feedback effect acth release
morning normal conditions plasma acth varies pgml pmoll cortisol levels mgdl nmoll
nighttime acth pgml cortisol levels mgdl
ria acth technically difficult perform however physiologic values associated stress vary widely overlap values pathologic range
reasons indirect screening tests dexamethasone test hyperadrenalism metyrapone cosyntropin tests adrenal insufficiency applied many disorders affecting pituitaryadrenal axis shown tables
acth amino acid polypeptide derived pro opiomelanocortin pomc
large protein synthesized pituitary also contains amino acid sequence beta endorphins endogenous opioids beta melanocyte stimulating hormone
first amino acids acth also melanocyte stimulating activity
thus clinical states acth excess associated hyperpigmentation proportional chronicity severity acth elevation
acth secretion characterized acute secretory bursts conforming circadian rhythm

normal circadian periodicity involved acth release readily altered stressful stimuli trauma exercise fever vaso active substances hypoglycemia emotional distress
stress may produce direct cns stimulation hypothalamus resulting release corticotropin releasing hormone crh hypothalamic pituitary portal system mediates acth synthesis release

cortisol life sustaining principle thomas addison associated function adrenal gland
cortisol synthesized cholesterol taken adrenal gland low density lipoprotein receptor pathway

clinical state excessive glucocorticoids known cushing syndrome associated obesity loss muscle mass myopathy loss bone matrix osteopenia loss subcutaneous perivascular collagen thin skin stria easy bruisability
high physiologic concentrations cortisol aldosterone like effects water salt metabolism resulting hypertension hypokalemia
common cause cushing syndrome cushing disease result inappropriate excessive secretion pituitary acth
convenient screening test rule cushing syndrome consists administration dexamethasone
potent long acting cortisol analogue detected assay serum cortisol
thus serum cortisol following dexamethasone may measured sign acth suppression
failure suppress cortisol physiologic dosage dexamethasone consistent cushing syndrome
metyrapone interferes cortisol synthesis also used assess function hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis
agent competitively suppresses beta hydroxylase enzyme catalyzes conversion deoxycortisol cortisol

ria plasma acth greatest diagnostic power three clinical settings diagnosis addison disease diagnosis paraneoplastic syndrome commonly called ectopic production acth differentiation cushing syndrome caused cushing disease tumorous production cortisol adrenal gland
nevertheless acth readily degraded plasma process transferring plasma reference laboratory introduce technical problems delays
moreover plasma acth limited usefulness differentiating rare patient acth secreting carcinoid tumor common patient stress obesity patients cushing disease
diagnosis suspected clinically patient fatigue nonspecific abdominal complaints hyperpigmentation orthostatic hypotension
markedly elevated plasma acth associated profoundly low serum cortisol confirms diagnosis addison disease
symptoms signs subtle plasma acth values may high enough confirm diagnosis
thus diagnosis clinically obvious cortrosyn test adrenal function appropriate screening study addison disease
patient diagnosis presents generalized weakness associated weight loss nocturia hypertension myopathy peripheral edema evidence neoplasia
profound hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis indicative highest cortisol values seen clinically
plasma acth values nanogram range confirm diagnosis may serve marker neoplasm
syndrome often caused undifferentiated carcinomas lung large anaplastic cell small oat cell synthesizing large acth precursor molecules variable biological activity
acth secreting tumors also found pancreas islet cell tumors thymus
carcinoid tumors malignant benign may secrete acth tumors long indolent course cause classical stigmata cushing syndrome obesity stria osteopenia
thus carcinoid tumors mimic cushing disease clinically acth levels conditions may nonspecific high normal range pgml
differential diagnosis carcinoid causing cushing syndrome requires extensive dexamethasone testing imaging studies
diagnosis cushing syndrome considered demonstrating lack cortisol suppression physiologic dexamethasone overnight dexamethasone test see plasma acth level differentiate pituitary ectopic tumor source acth autonomous cortisol producing adrenal tumor

situation acth cortisol profiles helpful since high values associated circadian rhythm stress overlap values cushing disease
overnight dexamethasone suppression test may readily make differentiation
however patients without cushing syndrome fail suppress
hour urine free cortisol determination confounded obesity making useful second screening study
another common question pituitary adrenal function status axis exposure pharmacologic dosage glucocorticoids following surgical removal adrenal tumor
usually axis requires months withdrawal long term steroids recover acth cortisol responsiveness stress
patients continue constitutional complaints suggestive adrenal insufficiency years
acth levels value assessing adrenal recovery since pituitary recovers adrenal
finding cortisol level mgdl would essentially exclude prolonged adrenal suppression syndrome
value lower cosyntropin metyrapone tests would necessary determine responsiveness axis stress
test measures suppressibility acth produced hypothalamic pituitary axis following physiologic dosage dexamethasone
normal suppression indicated reduced cortisol rules cushing syndrome
failure cortisol suppress dexamethasone requires measuring hour urinary free cortisol andor hour dexamethasone suppression test rule false positive result

test measures increment serum cortisol following injection cortrosyn cosyntropin

normal response definitely rules addison diseasebut abnormal response requires testing diagnosis adrenal insufficiency made certainty
cortrosyn mg given iv im normally increases baseline cortisol least mgdl value greater mgdl

mgdl increment cortisol stimulated value mgdl attained adrenal gland presumed adequate stimulation endogenous acth
therefore values rule addison disease nearly always exclude possibility secondary adrenal insufficiency
cortrosyn test may used emergency conditions diagnosis acute adrenal insufficiency adrenal crisis suspected clinical grounds
setting usually associated marked stress life threatening infection bleeding diathesis treatment could instituted cortisol values known
cortrosyn given iv concomitantly dexamethasone glucose saline baseline blood serum cortisol drawn
dexamethasone inhibit cortrosyn effect
blood serum cortisol taken minutes time steroid infusion may changed high dosage hydrocortisone provide additional mineralocorticoid effect
criteria used interpret results
normal adrenal function however serum cortisol directly proportional severity stress
baseline value less mgdl fails stimulate confirms diagnosis adrenal crisis
cortrosyn test may also used aid differential diagnosis cushing syndrome
cortrosyn given patient cushing disease baseline cortisol high exaggerated stimulatory response occur indicative adrenal hyperplasia e g mgdl baseline mgdl
adrenal adenoma baseline elevated often response occur autonomous tumor function
remarkable elevations serum cortisol baseline values mgdl suggestive adrenal carcinoma ectopic production acth
neither case cortrosyn produce stimulation
adrenal carcinoma even adenoma likely autonomous
paraneoplastic syndrome adrenal gland already maximal stimulation extraordinarily high concentrations ectopic acth
test measures hypothalamic pituitary feedback response acute inhibition cortisol synthesis
increase deoxycortisol following metyrapone also indicates normal adrenal gland function
thus metyrapone test assesses levels adrenal gland regulation
normal response definitively rules addison disease secondary adrenal insufficiency
subnormal response requires level axis tested starting adrenal response cortrosyn
normal individual mgkg metyrapone given bedtime associated acute increase acth elevates h deoxycortisol greater mgdl
value tenfold higher normal baseline less mgdl nmoll need measured
metyrapone test used cautiously patients suspected addison disease
metyrapone induced reduction cortisol synthesis addisonian may produce acute adrenal insufficiency
metyrapone also contraindicated patient acute distress circumstances cortrosyn test dexamethasone indicated
metyrapone test like cortrosyn test may done patients cushing syndrome
