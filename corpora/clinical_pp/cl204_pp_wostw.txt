vegetative functions bodily processes directly concerned maintenance life
category encompasses nutritional metabolic endocrine functions including eating sleeping menstruation bowel function bladder activity sexual performance
functions altered wide variety psychologic states
problems vegetative function frequent every patient emotional disorder asked disturbances food intake elimination menstruation sleep
clinician primarily investigates psychologically induced change may either increased decreased patient usual pattern
time questions related vegetative function explored physician already sought evidence anxiety depression interpersonal difficulties parts psychiatric database
physician determines whether association vegetative function disturbances emotional conflicts
helpful ask questions following bodily disturbance e g anorexia begin time emotional stress
become worse emotional stress increases
vary different situations
exception sexual area see chapter patients find difficult discuss problems related vegetative functions
almost everyone experienced disturbances bodily functions time little stigma attached admitting difficulties
usually temporal quantifiable relationship emotional symptoms disturbance vegetative function
increase decrease emotional symptoms often accompanied concomitant changes disturbance vegetative function
characteristically increased emotional stress associated increased vegetative dysfunction
also important exploring area ask general way disturbances physical function past physicians could find cause
patient asked ever physical problem physician could find cause
patient could also asked ever told physical symptoms result nervousness depression stress
important ask patients specifically presence eating disorders anorexia nervosa bulimia discussed later chapter
patients either disorder often secretive
almost never volunteer information regarding symptoms
nevertheless asked directly binge eating self induced vomiting use cathartics diuretics order lose weight many patients admit activities
addition physician always alert possibility anorexia nervosa female patient appears emaciated
early work investigators flanders dunbar franz alexander w
b
cannon hans selye others provided validation concept emotional conflicts result changes physical function
efforts link specific personality types specific psychological conflicts specific psychophysiological disorders attempted many times
example type personality described particularly prone coronary occlusion
type personality typically competitive restless preoccupied time
individuals characteristically also physiologic findings include high plasma triglycerides hyperinsulinemic response glucose challenge increased blood cholesterol levels increased levels norepinephrine urine
despite fact many patients coronary artery disease appear fit type personality many patients coronary artery disease fit personality type
seems reasonable basis current investigations view patients type personality prone coronary disease also seems clear means entire explanation condition
john nemiah peter sifneos postulated interesting concept alexithymia
alexithymia refers condition unable express feeling tones verbally
hypothesis psychosomatic symptoms developed alternative expression affect result inability express deal feelings verbally
modern neurologic research made much easier understand emotional conflicts result changes vegetative function
many neuronal circuits controlling emotions centered limbic system brain
limbic system many pathways connecting autonomic centers hypothalamus
emotional stress leads increased limbic system activity ample neuronal connections transmission increased activity hypothalamic areas control autonomic function
changes output autonomic centers pass autonomic nervous system end organs bowel bladder
presumably asthma hypertension peptic ulcer psychophysiologic disorders result least part long continued overactivity autonomic nervous system various end organs
extent usual vegetative function disrupted emotional conflict allows clinician make rough judgment severity emotional disturbance
psychiatric condition accompanying disturbance vegetative function general severe condition without bodily disturbance
presence distinct change vegetative function significance direction change since patients emotional symptoms may show opposite changes bodily function
example depressed patients decreased appetite patients overeat described
disturbances following areas vegetative function particular significance
appetite sleep menstruation bowel habits bladder function sexual performance
food strong emotional significance
infants repeatedly comforted offered food
many people associate process eating feelings security comfort happiness
eating become means alleviating mild anxiety depression
tendency eat response stress thought factor cases obesity
although patients react depression overeating usually depression mild
majority patients significant depression distinct loss appetite
somewhat similar way occasional patient anxiety may react increasing food consumption
large majority patients moderate severe anxiety degree decrease appetite although characteristically marked seen depression
anorexia nervosa particularly important disturbance eating
patients condition intense fear becoming obese fear subside weight loss progresses
unless adequately treated persistent refusal patients eat may lead death complications starvation
bulimia another eating disorder clinical importance
bulimia refers condition patients experience recurrent episodes large amounts food consumed short period time
episodes typically referred binges
patients bulimia frequently terminate episodes self induced vomiting
patients either anorexia nervosa bulimia may use cathartics diuretics effort lose weight
patients anorexia nervosa female large majority patients bulimia
although fatalities occur less often bulimia anorexia nervosa serious medical complications result bulimia including esophagitis dental damage toxicity use cathartics diuretics
disturbances sleep involve difficulties getting sleep staying asleep quality sleep
difficulty falling asleep occurs many patients either anxiety depression
pattern insomnia occurs primarily depression one patient able fall asleep awakens hours unable return sleep
many patients emotional conflicts troubled disturbing dreams
patients often complain feeling tired awaken morning
patients respond emotional stress withdrawal
clinician remember one form withdrawal sleep
minority patients much frequently depressed patients anxious ones sleep excessively
presence marked emotional stress female patients infrequently show change menstrual pattern
menstrual abnormalities occur several psychiatric conditions
patients marked depression often show decrease menstruation may progress cessation menstruation
amenorrhea also occurs anorexia nervosa
patients amenorrhea usually secondary starvation
amenorrhea also occurs pseudocyesis condition false pregnancy found certain women psychologic conflicts around intense desire become pregnant
changes bowel habits frequent emotional disturbances
diarrhea often occurs anxiety states
constipation frequently accompanies depression
disturbances genitourinary function infrequent depression
however presence anxiety often manifest increased frequency urination
sexual performance strongly influenced emotional stress
impotence frigidity frequent complaints states anxiety depression
resolution emotional conflicts frequently return sexual performance normal see also chapters impotence frigidity
