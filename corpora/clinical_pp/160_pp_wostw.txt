arthralgia means pain joint
polyarthralgia means pain several joints two purposes discussion
arthritis diagnosis symptom diagnosis requires physical signs articular inflammation physical roentgenographic signs osteoarthritis
major disorders associated arthritis hence arthralgia summarized table
preceding chapter
rheumatic pain syndrome localized one joints additional historical data required
first determine whether signs inflammation joint observed patient
redness warmth fever especially swelling specifically addressed
nature onset established early interview
arthralgia began recently rapid onset syndrome considered acute specific differential diagnosis table
suggested
regardless nature onset arthralgia persisted month longer considered chronic persistent differential diagnoses suggested depending whether one joint table
one joint table
symptomatic
obviously affected joint joints listed patient order involvement case polyarthralgia
helpful know joint arthralgia began subsequent pattern spread
move next
useful question
meanwhile interviewer lose sight behavior affected joint brief notes almost essential purpose three four involved
affected joint set joints interviewer might record date initial involvement severity progression date resolution occurred
classic migratory polyarthritis discrete episodes acute self limited arthritis apparent notations
case persistent polyarthralgia worth asking joint joints symptomatic illness though resulting information may helpful therapeutically diagnostically
disorders associated inflammatory polyarthritis extraarticular systemic manifestations addressed interview perhaps review systems approach
major extraarticular manifestations common arthropathies summarized table
preceding chapter
inexperienced interviewer might benefit referring list interview order assure completeness crucial area
importance questions overemphasized responses play major role suggesting specific connective tissue diseases spondyloarthropathies
osteoarthritis small hand joints connective tissue diseases familial especially women
fifteen patients spondyloarthropathy give family history similar disease
gout also familial rare patterns genetically determined
consequently family history necessary part musculoskeletal history arthralgia present
arthritis family
appropriate initial question positive response followed questions concerning joint distribution signs inflammation degree resulting disability
inquiry may possible identify disease fairly accurately affected relative
identification significantly contribute diagnosis patient interviewed
therapeutic rather diagnostic reasons important quantify seriousness chronic arthralgia syndrome terms disability
cant joint problem
useful initial question
whenever possible major disability linked involvement one specific joints
patients helpful approach issue viewpoint joint rather disability knee hip joint problem keep
progression disease also documented comparing disability two moments time cant could one year ago
completion portion history interviewer addressed gainful occupation pleasurable activities home self care well specific functional limitations
osteoarthritis basically noninflammatory arthropathy traumatic origin however overuse osteoarthritic joint initiate secondary inflammatory process
patterns joint usage history joint trauma explored patients suspected osteoarthritis
common arthropathies result initial primary inflammatory process synovial membrane joint
symptoms reflect inflammatory process least initially
many diseases potential causing articular destruction symptoms occur late course often reflect joint damage
general mechanical symptoms include less stiffness less joint pain rest predominantly due inflammation
inflammatory arthropathies heterogeneous group diseases etiologies known pathogenetic mechanisms diverse
arthralgia significant rheumatic symptom potentially serious diseases may reflect
arthralgia unaccompanied signs inflammation extraarticular symptoms may transient little clinical importance may represent initial stages connective tissue disease serious disorder
accompanied signs inflammation extraarticular symptoms arthralgia almost always clinically significant usually reflects diagnosable disease
