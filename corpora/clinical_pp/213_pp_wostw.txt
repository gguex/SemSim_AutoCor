family history consists collection information patient family members devoted understanding
heritable illness current family health status psychosocial disorders interactional relationship data
eliciting family history involves questioning several areas patient life medical psychologic social
family members significant others may need considered additional sources information
data collection efficiently completely accomplished using combination self administered health history questionnaire see figure
personal interview
according jolly associates time complete record thorough interview average minutes range minutes
timing family history within context medical history variable
elements family history seem appropriate related present illness presenting complaint suggesting colitis anginal chest pain
patients understand relevance questions illness consideration occurred family members
logical connection current problem made inserting family history review systems efficient may effect shortening list questions need asked later
opening line questioning accomplished bridging statement sometimes health person family members may affect one health
please tell health illnesses family
responses open ended question given information gathered direct questioning anyone family birth defect
using laundry list question anyone family emotional illness anxiety mania depression schizophrenia
content family history may gathered clusters questions see table
first cluster enable physician understand family composition patient proband least three generations must included
names sex relationship patient dates marriages births deaths recorded first degree relatives
first degree relatives would include spouse significant children siblings parents
cases e g considering x linked recessive trait information also gathered distant relatives half siblings grandparents uncles aunts
racial ethnic origins may give clues detection genetic diseases
second cluster questions focus history familial heritable illnesses family
hereditary condition likely family member condition similar patient
areas concern following deaths infants children congenital malformations biochemical metabolic disorders mental retardation spontaneous abortions infertility unexplained sudden deaths family members undergoing genetic counseling evaluation neurologic disorders family psychiatric history
regard specific disorders inquiry supplement list figure
anemia bleeding disorders gout migraine obesity
final area investigation kinds interactions relationships among family members
psychosocial problems also sought time
leaving line questioning end allows strengthening trust rapport within doctor patient relationship necessary successful interrogation potentially sensitive areas
major stressors family may responsible physical conditions
stomach pain headaches adolescent often stem extreme anxiety alcoholic parent impending divorce parents
identify following provides nurturing role family
breadwinner
makes decisions
conflicting overclose enmeshed domineering relationships
persons living immediate household
recording data family history may best accomplished combination diagrammatic narrative forms
genetic interactional data combined display referred genogram
represents important modification pedigree diagram medical diagnoses presented
retrieval information members family accomplished glance may compensate inability store charts family together
although key always included use standardized symbols notation presents clearest message
three generations recorded single generation horizontal line
generation may designated roman numeral
first born members farthest left
symbols except representing abortions size
male symbol square traditionally placed left round female spouse symbol
arrow pointing symbol identifies patient
parent child connection represented vertical line symbol
vertical line symbol connected horizontal line constitutes marriage line
dotted line may used surround members family living together household interactional relationship lines used denote extraordinary connections

finally emphasized statement medical record refer old charts family history never acceptable
family history relationships dynamic ever changing
old charts may useful source information updating must done detect genetic diseases status changes late onset acquired aging occurs e g huntington chorea
positive family history may clearly show autosomal dominant autosomal recessive sex linked pattern inheritance
contrast genetically determined disorder may exist negative family history
various modes inheritance may classified single gene disorders multifactorial disorders chromosomal aberrations see table
single gene disorders refer autosomal dominant autosomal recessive sex linked dominant sex linked recessive
nearly sex linked conditions x linked
traits known suspected inherited mendelian single gene disorders see gelehrter
autosomal dominant traits appear generation transmitted approximately male female offspring
homozygotes generally survive
autosomal recessive traits usually found siblings parents offspring
transmission affects roughly male female siblings
consanguinity factor autosomal recessive inheritance
female male ratio sex linked dominant disorders
affected males transmit disorder daughters sons
heterozygous females transmit disorder children homozygotes transmit children
sex linked recessive traits males manifest disorder commonly females
affected male transmits disorder daughters mating carrier female
affected male mating normal female never transmit disease son daughters carriers
factors nonpenetrance variable expressivity spontaneous mutation extramarital parentage may alter expression genetic trait
multifactorial disorders conditions produced combination genetic environmental factors consequently diagnosis difficult
environmental teratogens alcohol drugs identified two co etiologic agents disorders
much adult genetic disease multifactorial origin encompasses health problems hypertension coronary artery disease family cancer syndromes diabetes epilepsy
careful family population studies necessary spark suspicion genetic diagnosis
chromosomal aberrations two basic types numerical extra missing chromosomes occur structural segmental deletion duplication inversion translocation isochromosomes occur
structural alterations less common numerical ones
numerical alterations primarily arise process nondysjunction meiosis
nondysjunction mitosis fertilization occurred results two distinct cell types referred mosaicism
direct assessment chromosomes karyotype required diagnosis
usefulness family history begins search genetic diseases
genetic diseases rare though altogether represent major cause morbidity mortality
estimated pediatric hospital admissions genetically related condition
adults figure approaches
genetic counseling provided explain progression prognosis management current illnesses understand risks recurrence alternatives available prevent recurrence minimize burden family community genetic diseases way compatible patient personal values religious beliefs
certain serious risks life completely avoided case cholinesterase deficiency anesthetic accidents use suxamethonium
careful family history may provide help management patient disorder also clues screening identifying risk patients either prevention early intervention appropriate
obtaining family psychiatric history definite clinical benefit
child schizophrenic mother eightfold increase risk disorder well increased risk suicide
general population anxiety neurosis prevalence increases offspring persons disorder
persons mania depression roughly two thirds offspring years clinically depressed
cases family history succeeds identifying unsuspected cases illness need treatment may suggest physician shattered family system exists
finally detection family roles functioning give assistance achieving therapeutic goals compliance
may individual health illness result happens family family may predictably altered illness one members
using family systems theory effective interventions may directed altering family impact illness
family strengths weaknesses ability withstand major stresses future assessed
good family history may reveal unexplained symptoms manifestations stress related psychosomatic illness
