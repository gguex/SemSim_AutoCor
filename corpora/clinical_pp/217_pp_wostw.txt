tests discussed chapter may used screen disease asymptomatic individuals
screening involves testing unselected population presence particular condition
physicians test patients seek services truly unselected population term case finding would properly apply
screening test recommended widely must measured certain criteria
disease sought must cause significant morbidity mortality
treatment must available
disease must asymptomatic period treatment would improve outcome compared would achieved disease diagnosed caused symptoms
benefits making diagnosis must clearly outweigh risks
cost testing excessive
emphasized enough guidelines presented testing asymptomatic individuals
would necessarily constitute adequate evaluation patients symptoms might also inadequate patients particularly high risk one conditions
rather create yet another set guidelines u
preventive services task force summarized studies discussion
guidelines much less aggressive groups american cancer society
proctosigmoidoscopy stool occult blood test insufficient evidence recommend studies general population
studies cases colonoscopy may indicated risk factors
mammography test women every years beginning age concluding age unless pathology detected
begin earlier women high risk
pap smear begin testing onset sexual activity repeat every years
discontinue age previous smears consistently normal
cholesterol test adults
proctosigmoidoscopy generally performed cm flexible scope
patients indication procedure discussed well brief description procedure risks
primary risk otherwise healthy patient perforation occurs probably less one per examinations
small risk infection bacteremia would concern primarily immunocompromised patient one significant cardiac valvular abnormality prosthesis
preparation consists one two fleet enemas coming procedure usually overnight fast
immediately examination instrument checked visual clarity proper function light source suction air insufflation tip deflection
last centimeters shaft scope tip lightly coated lubricant
patient placed left lateral decubitus position
digital rectal examination performed
examining finger still anal canal tip scope carefully inserted finger proximal end scope supported controlled left hand
right hand positioned toward distal end shaft scope advance appropriate
scope quickly inserted maximal penetration using air insufflation needed
course continued insertion progress long lumen bowel clearly visible
scope withdrawn lumen comes view
examination performed scope withdrawal
complete degree sweep wall bowel carried repeatedly withdrawal phase
colorectal cancer surgically curable disease detected localized stage dukes bl
long term survival decreases significantly tumor spread bowel serosa dukes b lymph nodes dukes c distant sites dukes
rectal carcinomas slightly worse prognosis colon
cancers found proctosigmoidoscopy screening programs dukes stage b although distinction bl b made
nevertheless compares favorably cancers detected outside screening programs dukes c cases
familial colonic polyposis gardner syndrome inherited disorders multiple colonic polyps develop eventually transform adenocarcinoma
prophylactic colectomy recommended conditions
risk factors colonic carcinoma include family history colon carcinoma presence cancer family syndrome personal history previous colon adenomas carcinoma also breast gynecologic malignancies
another benefit derived proctosigmoidoscopy screening programs diagnosis benign neoplasms
one large study removed polyps found serial examinations
anticipated number cancers lower bowel developed study period lending support concept removing benign neoplasms may prevent development cancer
addition patients one polyp known higher risk additional polyps cancer elsewhere bowel likely develop additional polyps later
high risk patients identified serial colonoscopic evaluation benefit
emphasized however randomized studies prove reduction mortality proctosigmoidoscopy
yield finding invasive cancer rigid proctosigmoidoscopic screening low occurring
examinations
benign neoplasms found examinations
decades ago one half colorectal carcinomas thought located within reach examining finger two thirds within theoretical reach rigid sigmoidoscope
recent data shown fewer colorectal cancers found digital examination fewer located within cm anus
multiple studies rigid sigmoidoscopes experienced examiners demonstrated true average depth penetration less cm
reasons longer flexible sigmoidoscopes become preferred method screening examination
cm cm flexible sigmoidoscopes currently available
compared rigid scope cm flexible scope achieved nearly three times average depth penetration corresponding tripling yield benign neoplasm carcinoma
studies however done experienced endoscopists
cm flexible scope shown achieve depths penetration well cm totally inexperienced examiners cm nonendoscopists experience flexible scope
cm scope predictably visualize high risk area bowel yield great deal lower cm scope
first bowel movement consecutive days tested
testing period extended patient bowel movement day
stool specimen caught way prevented making contact water toilet
two sites bowel movement tested
specimen smeared guaiac impregnated filter paper
covered stored specimens collected
patient must return specimens promptly final collection
developing solution hydrogen peroxide denatured alcohol applied reverse side paper
hemoglobin peroxidase like activity oxidize guaiac blue compound
red meat frequently cause hemoccult tests turn positive must strictly avoided days collection
foods high peroxidase activity turnips horseradish also best avoided anti inflammatory drugs induce gastrointestinal bleeding
iron cause positive test induced bleeding probably important mechanism
testing obviously avoided menses active hemorrhoidal problem
antioxidant ascorbic acid yield falsely negative results likewise avoided
delays testing also cause false negative results
rehydration consists adding drop water guaiac paper adding developing solution
increases sensitivity decreases specificity
testing loose stools stools immersed toilet water effect
commercially available kits instruct patients test stools toilet bowl
hemoquant reliable also costly method improving sensitivity stool occult blood testing
hemoquant fecal hemoglobin reduced porphyrin measured fluorimetrically
amount hemoglobin stool calculated porphyrin value
test affected red meat peroxidase containing foods
dry stools concentration slightly increase hemoglobin values estimated stool
emphasized discussion proctosigmoidoscopy major barrier control colorectal cancer outside screening programs cancer spread beyond local area less cases diagnosis
proctosigmoidoscopy studies cancers detected stool occult blood testing programs still localized cases
benign neoplasms detected much often carcinomas removal polyps serial colonoscopic follow higher risk patients help prevent development cancer
proctosigmoidoscopy emphasized randomized studies prove reduction mortality stool occult blood testing
older individuals tested least one slide positive occult blood
one half people neoplastic condition mostly nonmalignant polyps
people positive slides
people tested invasive carcinoma
predictive value stool occult blood testing neoplasia malignant nonmalignant increases age
year old age group predictive value less rises well years old
stool hemoccult testing negative one third patients invasive cancers
polyps bleed less frequently cancers smaller polyp less likely bleed
nevertheless many people small polyps large polyps cancers small benign polyps common neoplastic cause stool occult blood
hemoquant hemoccult test rehydration require strict diet especially total abstinence red meat makes unsuitable large scale screening
certain individual cases compliance assured however may preferred standard hemoccult test
present commonly used method performing mammography screen film technique
study requires dedicated mammography unit molybdenum anode x ray tube finely calibrated focal spot x ray emission rather tungsten anode tube used standard radiographs
technique enhances contrast breast tissues time requires low doses radiation
breast compression required may result modest discomfort
premenopausal women mammography best scheduled week menstruation particularly patients experienced severe premenstrual breast tenderness
long term survival breast cancer correlates axillary lymph node status time diagnosis
ten year survival patients negative nodes compared whose nodes positive
risk factors breast cancer particular relevance personal history breast cancer breast cancer first degree relative history benign proliferative breast disease pregnancy age
screening breast examination mammography women age shown decrease deaths breast cancer randomized controlled health insurance plan hip study begun
use death endpoint study removed concerns length bias e diagnosing slow growing cancers would never resulted deaths lead time bias e diagnosing fatal cancer earlier without changing outcome way
usefulness mammography women age remains controversial
year follow hip study suggests late benefit year old group
significance unclear
data large multicenter screening program presumably better radiologic equipment experience interpretation showed mammography sensitive study
many tumors found year old group many minimal cancers noninfiltrating tumors infiltrating tumors less cm negative axillary nodes age groups
led speculation even gained aggressive screening advanced state technology
concerns raised however natural history minimal cancers known breast cancers
arguments countered statistics showing although prevalence high slow growing tumors symptomatic patients volunteering screening incidence consistent number predicted
cancer breast known increase frequency age expected multicenter screening program found many cancers older patients
randomized study enter patients age
recent studies suggested benefit mammographic screening beyond age
good evidence benefit testing elderly previously normal studies
proof radiation dosages used mammography increases risk breast cancer
japanese women exposed atomic bomb radium dial workers tuberculosis patients sanatoriums frequent fluoroscopies women treated radiation nonmalignant breast conditions studied
insufficient data doses rads
certainly doses rads predispose breast cancer
women ages markedly less sensitive radiation effect malignancies produced begin years radiation exposure
even linear relationship breast cancer radiation exposure extends receiving low dosages frequency women age would
cancers per million women per year per rad year delay
since example breast cancer attacks women age rate per million women per year patient years lost radiation induced cancer would immeasurable compared patient years saved screening
high cost mammography remains main obstacle widespread utilization
though test performed relatively inexpensively high volume screening program programs currently available
remembered however least partial return dollars spent mammography lower medical expenses generated women benefit screening
pap smear performed pelvic examination cervix visualized vaginal speculum
lubricant used examiner gloves speculum
ideally patient douched hours menstruating certainly contraindications
cervix covered mucus discharge cleared lightly dabbing large cotton swab
two specimens obtained
cotton swab inserted endocervical canal lightly rotated withdrawn
swab gently rolled glass slide
second specimen obtained inserting one tip ayre spatula cervical os rotating full degrees
specimen smeared onto second slide different portion slide
must promptly sprayed fixative
cancer cervix squamous cell type arises transition zone squamous columnar epithelium
transition zone may well cervical canal readily visible surface cervix area tested
adequate pap smear contain endocervical cells confirming examiner reached beyond transition zone
interpret smear properly laboratory must provided patient age date last menstrual period
must also told patient pregnant hormonal therapy wearing intrauterine device previous malignancy surgery radiation
unique feature cervical cancer remarkably long years period carcinoma situ exist becoming frankly invasive
carcinoma situ cervix frequent women early mid many years usual age invasive cancer cervix
identification situ phase pap smear testing resulted dramatic decrease frequency invasive carcinoma
cases rapid progression invasive cervical cancer occur
carcinoma situ cervix completely curable condition
hand carcinoma cervix year survival locally invasive regionally invasive
early age first sexual intercourse multiple sexual partners factors increase risk cervical cancer
promiscuity male partners may also important factor
women never sexual intercourse beyond years age normal previous pap smears hysterectomy nonmalignant disease low risk cervical malignancy
cytologic interpretation pap smears inexact variability interpretation
also definite pathologic abnormalities present one slide invariably present another slide patient
obtaining specimens endocervical canal exocervix repeat testing yearly least initially help obviate concerns false negative results
false positives occur variability interpretation carcinoma situ cases appear resolve spontaneously
happens quickly within months occur
controversy arisen recently medical organizations notably american cancer society changed routine recommendations pap smear testing traditional year every years yearly normal smears
criticism recommendations focused primarily large number women general population high risk sexual history
techniques involved cholesterol testing discussed detail chapter
long known hypercholesterolemia associated premature coronary artery disease sequelae recently convincing evidence patients derive benefit cholesterol levels decreased diet drug therapy
new data seem provide much needed proof
three randomized studies demonstrated reduction cardiac events lowering serum cholesterol
studies used drugs achieve reductions clofibrate cholestyramine gemfibrozil
clofibrate study entered men aged cholesterol levels upper third screened
triglycerides usually measured
study actually higher overall mortality treated group
cholestyramine study entered men aged cholesterol levels greater mgdl
triglycerides less accepted
overall mortality significantly reduced due increased number deaths judged violent accidental control group
gemfibrozil study entered men aged non hdl cholesterol greater mgdl
thirty seven percent elevated triglyceride well increased cholesterol
decrease total mortality demonstrated deaths due violence accidents intracranial hemorrhage control group
national cholesterol education program released recommended serum cholesterol measured adults years age
recommended serum cholesterols mgdl cholesterol repeated least every years
cholesterols without definite coronary heart disease two risk factors male sex one given dietary information cholesterol rechecked annually
others advised ldl cholesterol calculated decisions made based ldl cholesterol level
