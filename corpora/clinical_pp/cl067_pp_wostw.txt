sensory system provides information places individual relation environment
sensation may classified categories various methods dependent anatomic functional criteria
anatomic classification divides sensory function somatic visceral components general special subgroups
clinically however somatic sensation easily measured
one functional classification separates sensory modalities simple affective sensations termed protopathic sensations provide discriminative analysis regard environment termed epicritic
practical scheme classification developed early century sherrington remains useful clinician
scheme utilizes anatomic criteria including types locations end organs functional criteria types stimuli measured modality separate exteroceptive proprioceptive sensation
third sensory modality requires cortical analysis provide complex interpretation primary sensory information
three types sensation evaluated every patient examined
exteroceptive sensation also termed superficial sensation receptors skin mucous membranes
tactile touch sensation thigmesthesia
anesthesia absence touch appreciation hypoesthesia decrease touch appreciation hyperesthesia exaggeration touch sensation often unpleasant terms unfortunately used indiscriminately apply losses types sensation

paresthesia abnormal sensations perceived without specific stimulation

several cutaneous sensory receptors identified including free nerve endings multiple types elaborate encapsulated endings pacinian corpuscles merkel disks meissner corpuscles
physiologic experiments shown specific points skin respond pressure pain hot cold density points varies different sensory modalities example pain points pressure temperature points
greater part century controversy existed whether specific cutaneous receptors sensory modality
view finding different areas skin contain different types densities receptors areas capable perceiving sensory modalities albeit different sensitivities
example skin ear contains two types nerve endings sensitive touch pain heat cold
important point bearing question sensation perceived interpreted verbally expressed brain involves integration many different impulses
sensory fiber tracts cross entry spinal cord thalamus modalities sensation recognized cerebral cortex contralateral applied stimulus
