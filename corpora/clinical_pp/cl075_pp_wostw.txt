common far orthostatic hypotension dizziness syncope changing supine sitting standing position
occurs marked reduction standing blood pressure often unaccompanied usual compensatory increase heart rate autonomic neuropathy
diabetic patients tend develop parasympathetic autonomic neuropathy earlier sympathetic autonomic neuropathy
symptoms related parasympathetic denervation bowel bladder often prominent
contrasts progressive autonomic failure shy drager syndrome riley day syndrome drug induced dysautonomias major involvement sympathetic rather parasympathetic
sympathetic parasympathetic autonomic fibers contribute arousal erection ejaculatory responses sexual function
hence impotence relatively early symptom dysautonomias

table
lists signs autonomic dysfunction may detected physical examination
hallmark dysautonomias orthostatic hypotension
orthostatic hypotension suggested patient history dizziness syncope upon standing must documented physical examination
careful measuring standing blood pressure patients maximal decrease blood pressure often occurs within first seconds patient slump floor little measurable blood pressure restabilized supine position
someone assist blood pressure heart rate measurements patients suspected severe orthostatic hypotension
pupil interesting example structure reciprocal innervation sympathetic dilator parasympathetic constrictor autonomic fibers
adie pupil classic example parasympathetic denervation whereas horner syndrome classic example sympathetic denervation
