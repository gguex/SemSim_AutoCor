birth control plays major role reproductive overall health men women
fertility status couple individual categorized one four ways
wish become pregnant present time ambivalent procreation present time desire avoid pregnancy present time desire children desire terminate childbearing desire children
desired number children per family united states two
despite availability number contraceptive options close pregnancies united states unplanned approximately babies born unwanted time birth
particular concern subpopulation sexually mature yet psychologically matureadolescents
fewer one fourth
million sexually active teenage girls use effective contraceptives consistently
thus currently witnessing epidemic teenage pregnancies million teenage girls age years becoming pregnant year
one ten u
teenagers age becomes pregnant year highest rate industrialized nation world
netherlands percentage teenage girls sexually active becomes pregnant
failure united states provide adequate sex education adequate contraceptive options ready accessibility contraceptives teenagers leads unacceptably high rate unintended pregnancies
clinician explore patient reproductive life plan method birth control currently used medical surgical complications might affecting patient current use contraceptive
patient ability use particular method reliably crucial consideration selection methods
patient clinician may find effectiveness rates various methods important determining factor see table
assuming patient woman following questions help define current fertility goals need birth control use birth control attitudes toward birth control effects birth control menstruation sexual activity general health
questions may provided patient writing may asked physician counselor
ever would like baby

ever told use specific method birth control
ever suffered problems experienced complications birth control method
describe periods regular irregular painful heavy light
often intercourse
currently using method birth control
pleased current means birth control
partner pleased current means birth control
partner willing cooperate using birth control method
mind using method may interrupt lovemaking
ever become pregnant plan
unplanned pregnancy
unplanned pregnancy near future would consider
current thoughts sterilization
current thoughts abortion
much spend birth control method
receive medical health care regular basis
birth control methods designed prevent conception prevent nullify implantation
conception prevented hormonally disrupting menstrual cycle pills physically blocking passageway barrier methods sterilization somewhat less successfully abstinence fertile periods withdrawal
implantation impaired via use foreign body intrauterine device via surgical removal abortion
average american woman starts menstruate
years age ceases menses ages
lifetime may ovulate times conceive times deliveries
basic understanding menstrual cycle fundamental understanding many contraceptive methods work see figure
woman fertility tied monthly release ovum although cycles ovulatory
ovulatory cycles tend regular anovulatory cycles painful anovulatory cycles associated midcycle pain mittelschmerz women
average menstrual cycle days long
first day blood flow considered day cycle marks menstrual phase
menstrual phase endometrial lining sheds blood levels estrogen progesterone decline
declining estrogen levels decrease inhibition hypothalamus produces follicle stimulating hormone releasing factor fsh rf stimulate release fsh luteinizing hormone lh pituitary
day ovary enters follicular phase uterus enters proliferative phase
fsh stimulates growth several follicles ovary
eventually developing follicles atrophy dominant follicle matures
lh causes follicles secrete estrogen acts increase lh levels decrease fsh levels
estrogen levels continue rise endometrium uterus thickens uterine glands enlarge
positive feedback loop rising lh produces estrogen turn stimulates greater lh levels culminates lh surge reference point endocrinologic studies menstrual cycle
surge promotes maturation follicle ovulation follicle formation corpus luteum ruptured follicle
formation estrogen progesterone releasing corpus luteum ovary enters luteal phase uterus enters secretory phase
progesterone ovaries stimulates endometrial glands produce mucus like secretion preparation implantation fertilized egg
phase lasts days women thus menstrual cycle shorter longer days generally except cases luteal phase deficiency longer shorter menstrual proliferative stages
fertilization occurs egg implants endometrium trophoblast produces human chorionic gonadotropin maintain progesterone secretion corpus luteum placenta mature enough weeks secrete hormones
fertilization occur progesterone secreted corpus luteum inhibits hypothalamic production fsh rf resulting fall lh secretion pituitary
without trophoblast stimulation corpus luteum atrophies days ovulation thus causing estrogen progesterone levels fall
thickened lining uterus longer maintained sloughed
oral contraceptives provide two hormones
estrogens birth control pills inhibit ovulation via effect hypothalamus subsequent suppression pituitary fsh lh inhibit implantation fertilized egg accelerate ovum transport cause luteolysis degeneration corpus luteum thereby causing fall serum progesterone levels prevents normal implantation placental attachment
progestins birth control pills create thick cervical mucus hampers transport sperm inhibit capacitation required sperm penetrate cells macromolecular investments surrounding ovum inhibit implantation inhibit ovulation subtle disturbance hypothalamic pituitary ovarian functions modification midcycle surge fsh lh
intrauterine devices thought create local foreign body inflammatory response causes lysis blastocyst sperm prevention implantation increase local production prostaglandins inhibit implantation increase motility ovum fallopian tube immobilize sperm pass uterine cavity
felt iud prevents contraception women effects sperm pass uterine cavity
copper copper bearing iuds may compete zinc inhibit carbonic anhydrase alkaline phosphatase activity well possibly interfere estrogen uptake effects
progesterone elaborating iuds may disrupt proliferative secretory maturation process impair implantation
barrier methods contraception include condoms diaphragms sponges cervical caps prevent sperm entering uterine cavity
spermicides used diaphragm cervical cap incorporated sponge kill sperm thus providing additional contraceptive effect sperm bypass barrier
fertility awareness methods allow women practice abstinence days potential fertility
methods used detect fertile days include basal body temperature charting observation cervical mucus changes prediction use calendar
fertility awareness methods also used help couples plan sexual intercourse trying conceive
sterilization irreversible method preventing conception
vasectomized male sperm transport obstructed via ligation vas deferens
sterilized female ovum transport obstructed via ligation fallopian tubes
abortion unsafe end second trimester
products conception may removed use several methods surgical medical
surgical methods include vacuum curettage weeks gestation dilation curettage dilation evacuation common method used weeks gestation rarely hysterotomy hysterectomy
medical methods include prostaglandins
hypertonic saline hypertonic urea
practicing clinician must aware fertility goals practices patients two basic reasons risks pregnancy risks contraception
pregnancy may adversely affect physical psychologic health individual relationship family unit
women risk less ideal outcome pregnancy child include following high parity recent delivery less months recurrent premature deliveries stillbirths history postpartum depression age less years chronic hypertension sickle cell disease advanced heart disease perhaps important context women wish pregnant
efforts avoid pregnancy contraceptives used great number individuals
clinicians need understand potential complications contraceptives
table
summarizes relative indications contraindications complications different approaches fertility control
managing complications associated contraceptive methods part best avoid polypharmacy approach may include measures prescribing diuretics pill induced hypertension pyridoxine pill associated depression cafergot pill induced migraines leaving iud place giving antibiotic treatment pelvic inflammatory disease
remainder discussion focuses serious complications side effects contraceptive use
serious side effects pills cardiovascular
certain women greater risk heart attacks strokes pill
high risk women include smoke years age health problems hypertension diabetes heart vascular disease family history problems
excess annual death rate attributable pill use follows
patients carefully taught five early danger signals shown figure
patients experiencing signs thoroughly evaluated
less serious symptoms may managed observation dosage modification discontinuation pill

two iuds available united states progestasert system elaborates small amount hormone progesterone copper paragard elaborates copper
progestasert system must replaced year
quite likely copper remains effective longer year limit currently recommended
vaginal contraceptives diaphragm sponge may increase user risk developing toxic shock syndrome
users advised use barrier methods menses avoid leaving device place longer hours
symptoms toxic shock syndrome include fever diarrhea vomiting muscle aches sunburn like rash
problems associated vaginal contraceptives include allergy urinary tract infection discomfort course pregnancy
adequate fit correct use may prevent less serious problems
serious complications related sterilization procedure associated general anesthesia used
vasectomized patients problems managed simply application heat ice prescription pain medications antibiotics
complications following laparoscopy mesosalpingeal tears bowel burns uterine trauma require surgical repair
minilaparotomy complications include wound infection hematoma uterine perforation bladder injury
abortion complications include incomplete abortion lacerations perforations hemorrhage
although deaths rare generally caused infection pulmonary emboli anesthesia hemorrhage coagulopathy preexisting health problems
studies show earlier abortion performed safer
moreover dilation evacuation safer procedure saline instillation use prostaglandins
following problems may managed follows
infection remove remaining tissue treat appropriate antibiotics
hospitalize patient parenteral antibiotics required infection extends beyond uterus
retained products conception patient generally exhibits enlarged tender uterus bleeding
remove remaining tissue
continuing pregnancy rule bicornuate uterus twin pregnancies ectopic pregnancy
cervical uterine trauma management ranges simple observation hysterectomy
remembered birth control methods pose risk adverse effects effects beneficial
pill offers protection pid ovarian endometrial cancer fibrocystic breast disease fibroadenomas breast functional ovarian cysts
alleviates menstrual pain irregularity well diminishing amount blood lost menstrual flow thus reducing risk anemia
barrier methods spermicides inhibit sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus hiv
fertility awareness methods used identify fertile periods used adjunct birth control methods means attempting conception
patient education utmost importance field family planning
educated patient use method reliably satisfaction
also able identify early signs symptoms may otherwise led serious complications
