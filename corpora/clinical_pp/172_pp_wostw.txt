normal vaginal bleeding occurs female ovulatory cycle beginning menarche onset menses generally occurs years age
ends menopause cessation menses generally age years
abnormal vaginal bleeding may occur association independent menstruation
bleeding related cycle may abnormal timing duration quantity
polymenorrhea frequent menses refers menstrual interval less days
oligomenorrhea infrequent menses interval greater days less
amenorrhea absence menses refers failure menstruate days longer
metrorrhagia increased duration menstrual flow beyond days continuous cycle
intermenstrual bleeding occurs menses discontinuous cycle
hypomenorrhea term abnormally low bleeding substantially less ml per menstrual cycle hypermenorrhea refers excessive bleeding ml cycle normal duration
history determine following information
premenarchal bleeding may associated precocious puberty bleeding age years onset cessation menses characteristics menstrual cycle interval duration amount flow last monthly period postcoital bleeding bleeding intercourse association douching postmenopausal bleeding bleeding occurring postmenopausal female
many associated findings history physical examination must evaluated order determine etiology abnormal bleeding
basic general complete gynecologic history physical examination extremely helpful
ask associated pain discharge bladder symptoms nausea vomiting fever infertility history points
physical examination look conditions abnormal phenotype breast development abnormal hair distribution thyroid enlargement abdominal distention tenderness hepatomegaly
look pelvic tumor cervical lesions polyps tenderness pelvic examination
special diagnostic procedures hormonal assays visual field tests chest x rays laparoscopy vaginal cytology colposcopy ultrasonography culdocentesis endometrial curettage pelvic examination anesthesia many others helpful
menstruation usually begins age
young girls menstruated age vaginal bleeding age suspected gynecologic disease
menarche usually appears years thelarche breast development
menopause associated symptoms cessation menses usually occurs age
patient still menstruating regularly age undergo dilation curettage c even asymptomatic
patient stopped menses months begins vaginal bleeding careful examination
examination reveal gross neoplasm cervix c must done
begin evaluation asking patient onset menses determine patient ceased menstruation
three clinical characteristics cyclic menstruation recorded adult patient
menstrual interval length cycle
menstrual interval counted first day one flow first day next flow ordinarily days
definition normal menstrual interval days
therefore menstruation occurring frequently days considered abnormal polymenorrhea menstruation occurring less frequently every days considered abnormal oligomenorrhea
menses absent days patient said amenorrhea
duration flow
usually days duration days still considered normal
duration flow greater days patient said metrorrhagia bleeding beyond normal duration flow intermenstrual period
intermenstrual period counted last day one flow first day next flow
therefore metrorrhagia intermenstrual bleeding synonymous
practical usage terms distinguished depending whether bleeding continuous intermenstrual period metrorrhagia discontinuous intermenstrual period intermenstrual bleeding
explained figure
amount flow
difficult define
normal amount blood lost menstrual flow ml
practical way measure amount flow however evaluation therefore rather subjective
menorrhagia hypermenorrhea refer increase amount menstrual flow ml
hypomenorrhea refers decrease amount menstrual flow substantially less ml per cycle
important ask patient specifically last period
many patients assume occurrence bleeding episode period
failure make distinction result misleading information
date last menstrual period included database female patients
record date menstrual flow began
therefore simply asking patient last menstrual period
sufficient
ask instead first day last menstrual period
also record duration flow number days
date previous menstrual period recorded duration flow
ask patient periods normal
deviation normal recorded
whenever database updated date last menstrual period also updated
ask patient evidence bleeding intercourse association douching
significance variety gynecologic complaints findings changes tremendously menopause
complaint vaginal bleeding menopause considered abnormal
matter slight bleeding always consider abnormal investigate
inception menses menarche depends previous development normal puberty
menarche latest event puberty
mechanisms responsible start puberty resulting menarche great extent unknown
puberty associated increased secretion gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh hypothalamus consequent increased secretion gonadotropins follicle stimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh adenohypophysis
results increased secretion estrogens mostly estradiol b estrone ovary
finally cyclic secretion gnrh fsh lh established consequence cyclic secretion estrogens progesterone ovaries occurs
result endometrium undergoes cyclic stimulation menses start
first day normal menstrual cycle plasma levels fsh lh estrogens progesterone relatively low
plasma estrogens rise slowly first days abruptly around thirteenth fifteenth day producing midcycle peak
level diminishes somewhat rise twenty second day form second luteal peak fall finally low levels menstrual flow starts
plasma fsh lh also low menstrual flow remain low thirteenth fifteenth day cycle sharp abrupt rise concentration rapidly subsides midcycle peak
peak appears follow midcycle estrogen peak hours
single peak fsh lh
plasma progesterone remains low midcycle
concentration rises form broad luteal peak corresponding luteal estrogen peak falls low levels menstrual flow starts
midcycle peak gonadotropins appears responsible ovulation luteal estrogen progesterone peaks correspond formation secretion corpus luteum
elevation plasma estrogens first part midcycle estrogen peak thought trigger gonadotropin peak subsequent ovulation
menopause regarded physiologic ovarian failure
reasons unknown ovary ceases respond gonadotropin stimulation around age
plasma estradiol b low since ovulation plasma progesterone remains low
endometrium therefore stimulated menses
plasma fsh lh greatly elevated remain many years
variety gynecologic problems associated abnormal menstruation
invasive cervical cancer may cause menometrorrhagia postcoital bleeding
tubal pregnancy may cause oligomenorrhea followed metrorrhagia
uterine myomas pelvic endometriosis pelvic inflammatory disease adenomyosis dysfunctional uterine bleeding may cause menorrhagia
adenomatous endometrial hyperplasia endometrial adenocarcinoma may cause postmenopausal bleeding
functioning ovarian tumors may cause variety menstrual abnormalities depending hormone produced tumor
normal intrauterine pregnancy frequent explanation oligomenorrhea followed amenorrhea
bleeding occurs signs puberty one must include possibility malignancy foreign body vagina trauma
healthy adult females usually menstruate normally
however patient guaranteed complete state health simply menstruation normal even though women menstruate normally usually feel better think healthy
hand patient likely consider abnormal menstruation sign ill health
may manifestation either general medical disease specific gynecologic problem
example oligomenorrhea amenorrhea may associated hypothyroidism menstrual problem may associated tuberculosis
thrombocytopenia may associated menorrhagia metrorrhagia
amount flow important determine
measured accurately average seems around ml per menstrual cycle varies among otherwise normal patients ml
careful history must obtained flow properly evaluated
important ask specifically patient last menstrual period
patient may understand whether flow normal basis comparison
impression flow whether light normal heavy important standpoint knowing feels however
additional helpful questions many tampons pads use heaviest day flow
well soaked tampons pads
patient fastidious menstrual flow may change pads slightest sign staining
may actually use many tampons pads per day lose less blood another patient uses pads per day change pads soaked corner corner
patients bleed heavily may also state necessity using two tampons pads time sheets towels
passage definite aggregates red blood cells clots significant indicates heavy bleeding
ordinarily menstrual flow controlled use vaginal tampons alone one assume menstrual flow heavy
patient may heavy menstrual flow normal hemoglobin hematocrit value
excess menstruation may result iron deficiency iron deficiency anemia late manifestation excessive menstrual flow
therefore history excessive menstrual flow discounted simply basis normal hematocrit value
