family history heart disease obtained identify presence cardiovascular disease genetically determined disorders family may affect cardiovascular system patient descendants
following approach provides detailed pedigree applies possible inherited illnesses
patient asked list family members living dead beginning oldest child proceeding children brothers sisters parents uncles aunts grandparents
parental consanguinity parents blood relatives elicited since significantly increase possibility rare recessively inherited disease
name age sex location state health occurrence congenital defects significant illnesses obtained
race religious ethnic background occurrence abortions stillbirths miscarriages early death important
family members may also provide detailed knowledge family ancestors relatives
possible family history cardiovascular disease specifically explored phrasing questions several ways avoid overlooking important information
following areas emphasized
family members known heart vascular disease
include myocardial infarction heart attack coronary thrombosis heart failure congestion dropsy aneurysm bubble blowout artery stroke cva hardening arteries sudden death arrhythmia rhythm disturbance wpw irregular racing heart rheumatic fever
familial risk factors cardiovascular disease
include hypertension high blood pressure high blood diabetes mellitus high sugar hyperlipidemia high fat high cholesterol
congenital heart disease genetic syndrome family
questions focus birth defects blue baby unusual stature mental physical retardation
possibility maternal rubella drugs alcohol viral infections pregnancy questioned
cardiovascular disorders proven suggested familial basis include congenital heart disease atherosclerotic heart disease hypertension rheumatic heart disease
studies nora nora large number patients congenital heart disease showed defects primarily related genetic factors environmental multifactorial
environmental catalysts included drugs viruses maternal nutrition maternal metabolism fetal hemodynamics
specific cardiovascular teratogens included drugs alcohol associated ventricular septal defect vsd patent ductus arteriosus pda atrial septal defect asd amphetamines vsd pda asd transposition great arteries tga anticonvulsants hydantoin pulmonic stenosis ps aortic stenosis pda coarctation aorta trimethadione tga tetralogy fallot hypoplastic left heart lithium ebstein anomaly tricuspid atresia asd sex hormones vsd tga tetralogy thalidomide tetralogy vsd asd truncus arteriosus disease states rubella peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis pda vsd asd diabetes tga vsd coarctation aorta lupus erythematosus heart block phenylketonuria tetralogy vsd asd
multifactorial group thought consist patients genetic predisposition cardiovascular disease due small additive effects many genes polygenic environmental trigger produces cardiovascular malformation
noras concluded production anomaly teratogen requires certain conditions including genetic predisposition maldevelopment genetic predisposition react adversely teratogen exposure teratogen vulnerable period embryonic development
study others noted recurrence risk congenital cardiovascular disease families increases two threefold two affected family members particularly two affected first degree relatives parent child patient severely affected
common prevalence defect general population likely recur first degree relatives
history parental consanguinity especially important second cousins chance sharing particular gene whereas third cousins likelihood
family history establishes disorder inherited mendelian pattern likelihood patient similarly affected estimated
family history coronary disease elusive define independent risk factor multiple risk factorsdiabetes cigarette smoking hyperlipidemia hypertensionalso cluster families
multivariate analysis indicated history myocardial infarction first degree relative confers risk two three times person without family history
particularly important coronary disease presenting late middle age patients minimum risk profile otherwise
familial hyperlipidemia hypertension strong risk factors predicting development coronary disease family members
family history hypertension twice common hypertensive population normotensives
polygenic mode inheritance found
genetic factors include inherited defect cellular sodium transport well abnormal response psychogenic stress
pheochromocytoma rare cause hypertension may familial
high familial incidence rheumatic fever reported however genetic influence follow mendelian pattern environmental factors may play interacting role
inherited cardiovascular diseases may involve cardiovascular system component extensive genetic disorder syndrome
possibility genetically determined disease may immediately apparent ellis van creveld syndrome indirect poorly understood influence coronary atherosclerosis
forms heart disease mitral valve prolapse atrial septal defect may genetically determined patients others
importance family history emphasized number variety problems transmitted mendelian inheritance multifactorial influences chromosomal abnormalities
extensive although incomplete list would include genetic diseases associated abnormal electrocardiogram arrhythmia diseases affecting myocardium pericardium valves septa vascular system generally
