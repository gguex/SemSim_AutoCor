audiometry consists tests function hearing mechanism
includes tests mechanical sound transmission middle ear function neural sound transmission cochlear function speech discrimination ability central integration
complete evaluation patient hearing must done trained personnel using instruments designed specifically purpose
pure tones single frequencies used test air bone conduction
speech testing done audiometer
audiometer electric instrument consisting pure tone generator bone conduction oscillator measuring cochlear function attenuator varying loudness microphone speech testing earphones air conduction testing
tests include impedance audiometry measures mobility air pressure middle ear system middle ear stapedial reflexes auditory brainstem response abr measures neural transmission time cochlea brainstem
pure tone audiometric air conduction testing performed presenting pure tone ear earphone measuring lowest intensity decibels db tone perceived time
measurement called threshold
testing procedure repeated specific frequencies hertz hz cycles per second ear thresholds recorded graph called audiogram
bone conduction testing done placing oscillator mastoid process measuring threshold frequencies
masking noise sometimes used nontest ear prevent participation test
audiogram graph depicting hearing thresholds decibels ordinate frequency hertz abscissa

used plot thresholds pure tone air bone conduction testing
zero level audiogram arbitrary sound pressure level indicates ideal normal hearing young adults
speech testing measurement patient ability hear understand speech
speech reception threshold srt lowest decibel level patient correctly repeat test words
speech threshold within ± db pure tone average frequencies hz
speech discrimination score obtained using phonetically balanced one syllable words usually presented db hearing threshold obtained pure tone audiogram
speech discrimination usually good purely conductive hearing losses presentation level loud enough
speech discrimination scores variable sensorineural losses
poor speech discrimination less presence little loss pure tones raises index suspicion retrocochlear disease
impedance audiometry hermetic seal obtained inserting probe tip external ear canal
pressure enclosed cavity varied mm ho change sound pressure level probe tone graphed
shows movement middle ear system pressure varied

normal ear reflex thresholds seen db pure tone thresholds
db reflex threshold hz contraction stapedius sustained least seconds
reflex decay failure sustain contraction seconds one earliest signs retrocochlear disease
auditory brainstem response abr audiometry electrodes placed patient vertex earlobes forehead
clicks delivered earphones computer sums time locked responses potentials first msec sound stimulation
responses display five characteristic waves generated predictable latencies
response must reliably repeatable evaluation made

conductive hearing loss may caused obstruction external ear canal e g wax middle ear problems infection tumor fixation ossicles otosclerosis congenital diseases
many conductive losses managed medically surgically
sensorineural hearing loss cochlear eighth nerve damage may caused conditions maternal rubella mumps meningitis noise trauma otologic effects aging presbycusis ototoxic drugs trauma ménière disease hyperlipidemia hereditary syndromes demyelinating diseases tumors affecting eighth nerve
