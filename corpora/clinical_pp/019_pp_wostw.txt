carotid pulse characterized smooth relatively rapid upstroke smooth gradual downstroke interrupted briefly pulse peak
palpable pulsatile changes carotid arterial diameter virtually identical intraluminal pressure pulse
abnormalities carotid pulse may involve alteration amplitude pulse peak distortion upstroke downstroke combination changes
carotid arterial pulses usually examined patient supine trunk patient body slightly elevated
patient chin elevated allow easy palpation yet enough tighten neck muscles
palpation pulse examiner uses tactile mechanoreceptors fingertips sense movement arterial wall associated pressure pulse passes site palpation
fingers positioned larynx anterior border sternocleidomastoid muscle level cricoid cartilage
palpating pulse degree pressure applied artery varied maximum pulsation appreciated
opinions vary many fingers used proper positional relationship patient examiner
physicians believe tactile stimulus accentuated using single finger may even prefer use thumb
others absolutely forbid use thumb palpation favor use two three fingers
whichever finger combination fingers used essential examiner ascertain perceiving fingertip pulse
potential error detected pressing finger adjacent body site overlying patient artery
likely examiner perceive pulse uses thumb
generally carotid artery palpated examiner sitting standing comfortably patient right side
clinicians however prefer examine carotid pulsations standing head patient bed
simultaneous palpation carotid artery auscultation heart occasionally beneficial examiner positioning patient right side seems preferable
palpation arterial pulse may directed toward assessing cardiac performance determining cardiac rate rhythm establishing integrity peripheral arterial blood supply localizing peripheral lesions
examination carotid pulse generally directed toward evaluating status heart
palpation carotid pulse important component examination also include inspection auscultation
absence visible carotid pulsations suggest marked decrease carotid pulse amplitude
presence bruit may clue partial carotid obstruction may sound transmitted cardiac murmur
generally brachial artery preferable site evaluating condition patient arterial walls
hardness tortuosity arterial wall best assessed site
heart rate rhythm usually assessed palpating brachial radial pulse
palpation carotid artery normally detects smooth fairly rapid outward movement beginning shortly first heart sound cardiac apical impulse
pulse peaks one third way systole
peak sustained momentarily followed downstroke somewhat less rapid upstroke
variations pattern may noted upstroke summit downstroke
examiner timing carotid pulse events may improved simultaneous auscultation heart
palpation carotid pulse premature beat may helpful certain pulse abnormalities accentuated following premature contraction
arterial pulse reflects interaction driving force impedance blood flow
driving force dependent intrinsic contractility left ventricle size shape heart heart rate
impedance related primarily peripheral resistance arterial compliance associated distensibility vessel wall
arterial pulse wave begins opening aortic valve ejection blood left ventricle
pressure pulse increases sharply blood enters aorta faster flows periphery
left ventricle ejects stroke volume quite rapidly
major portion rapidly ejected volume transiently held proximal aorta large central arteries normally quite distensible
rapidly rising portion carotid pressure curve termed anacrotic limb anacrotic greek upbeat
height pulse pressure roughly proportional ratio stroke volume arterial distensibility
arterial distensibility however decreases distending pressure within artery increases
consequently given stroke volume produce larger pulse pressure mean arterial pressure elevated
arterial distensibility also inversely related rate rise intraluminal pressure
rate ventricular ejection accelerates arterial wall stiffens pulse pressure increases
amplitude pulse pressure also modified peripheral runoff
accelerated runoff lower diastolic pressure result higher amplitude pulse pressure
upstroke carotid pulse reflects driving force vessel compliance downstroke reflects distensibility vessels peripheral resistance
aortic pressure curve peaks begins decline ventricular ejection slows blood continues flow periphery
initial phase ventricular relaxation momentary reversal blood flow compliant central arteries back toward ventricle
reversal flow aortic valves close
notch descending limb aortic pressure curve associated transient reversal blood flow
subsequent smaller secondary positive wave dicrotic peak dicrotic greek double beat attributed elastic recoil aorta aortic valve
following small wave aortic pressure declines peripheral runoff continues
inequality pulse amplitude two carotid arteries usually reflects atherosclerosis
possible explanations include aortic dissection arteritis embolus
kinking carotid artery occasionally seen hypertensive patient may simulate aneurysm
hyperkinetic pulse figure characterized increase velocity upstroke amplitude
water hammer corrigan pulse characterized brisk upstroke large amplitude rapid collapse extreme form hyperkinetic pulse
hyperkinetic pulses may associated anxiety exercise fever thyrotoxicosis hypertension aortic regurgitation arterio venous fistula patent ductus arteriosus
patients marked bradycardia may compensate large stroke volume clinically manifest hyperkinetic pulse
water hammer pulse usually associated aortic regurgitation
