dizzy describe many different sensations clinician first priority must pin patient means
best way ask patient describe feelings without using word dizzy
sometimes becomes apparent patient fact describing fatigue weakness visual difficulty anxiety situations must handled outlined chapters
often subjective sensation dizziness identified precisely one four types dizziness vertigo disequilibrium presyncope lightheadedness
clinical approach dizzy patient depends crucially distinguishing among various kinds dizziness since differential diagnosis peculiar type
vertigo refers illusion environmental motion classically described spinning whirling
sense motion usually rotatorylike getting merry go roundbut may linearthe ground tilts like boat sea
disorientation space sense illusory motion common denominators
vertigo always reflects dysfunction level vestibular system problems discussed chapter
disequilibrium represents disturbance balance coordination confident ambulation impaired
symptomatically patients clearly profess problem legs others feel dizzy head
common patients disequilibrium perception ambulation either causes problem clearly makes worse
observation patient gait careful neurologic examination thus essential evaluating type dizziness
presyncope means patient senses impending loss consciousness
patient fact experienced true syncope actual loss consciousness considerations chapter apply
patient ever actually lost consciousness complaint feel like pass viewed skeptically since types dizziness may described
circumstances approach syncope chapter may may pertinent
lightheadedness difficult describe without using word dizzy verbal imprecision fact helpful clinician
lightheadedness refers sensation head clearly vertiginous presyncopal invariably related ambulation
vague negative definition emphasizes lightheaded patient description always hazily imprecise even articulate patients frustrated request describe feeling without saying dizzy
describe floating feeling like head attached body high giddy
many search better description finally concede feel dizzy
patient initial spontaneous description usually best clue type dizziness
ask leading questions patient attempted elaborate words dizzy
patient describes symptoms clinician must try interpret descriptions formulate initial hypothesis four types dizziness sound like
dizziness episodic recurrent ask patient recount detail setting circumstances events recent memorable occurrences
following patient untutored tale analyze symptoms would analyze symptom often occur

symptoms associated dizziness
often conclusion patient history tentative hypothesis reached type dizziness sometimes even specific diagnosis see
table
illustrates causes dizziness among patients studied dizziness clinic
note fact common specific causes four general types dizziness often recognizable simply listening patient minutes
example
among patients vertigo benign positional vertigo common
condition usually afflicts middle aged older persons describe brief episodes vertigo always positional vertigo sometimes nausea vomiting occurs episodically patient moves head particular position turning bed looking moving standing supine position
unlike patients many types vertigo patients benign positional vertigo asymptomatic except changing position
description must analyzed outlined chapter history alone often makes diagnosis
similarly common cause lightheadedness hyperventilation diagnosis must confirmed testing see usually strongly suspected analyzing patient history
hyperventilators may initially describe loss balance unsteadiness feeling like faint fact closer questioning usually reveals dizziness vague unpredictable often constantly present intermittently worse inconsistently related position activity ambulation
frequently hyperventilators describe associated symptoms emanate multiple different organ systemsepisodic palpitations abdominal bloating paresthesias weakness especially common
concatenation seemingly disparate symptoms associated vaguely described dizziness typical hyperventilation
fact patient often punctuates conversation occasional deep sighing respiration may unaware obvious alert interviewer
multiple sensory deficit syndrome common cause disequilibrium history alone usually shouts diagnosis
patients often elderly people afflicted variety ills summate impair patient ability ambulate unassisted
visual impairment deafness peripheral neuropathy painful disabling orthopedic disorders muscle weakness collectively conspire alter patient perception space fluidity motion confidence walking
people usually complain simply unsteady feet afraid fall dramatically improved use cane supporting arm companion
thorough examination observation patient gait essential history always points way
finally orthostatic hypotension probably common cause presyncope disorders general greatly underrepresented drachman hart study group table
patients feel faint fall occurs episodically upright position invariably alleviated quickly lying
patient often realized purely orthostatic nature dizziness listening patient description typical episodes always reveals crucial connection
classic clinical histories forthcoming especially general type dizziness remains unclear clinician prompt patient variety analogies different types dizziness
describing patient examples dizziness types often allows patient describe vague feelings clearly
example brief vertigo experienced many people spinning revolving stool chair amusement parks overindulging alcohol
disequilibrium likened sensation walking complete darkness especially drowsy may occur awakening night go bathroom
presyncope familiar people felt brief orthostatic faintness upon standing prolonged squat gardening working floor
surprising number people fact fainted time past readily identify sense impending faint
finally lightheadedness difficult describe almost universally understood intuitive experiential sense
many lightheaded patients directly deny analogies immediately brighten word suggestedyes exactly feel lightheaded despite irony hallmark lightheadedness inexactitude
history almost always revealing physical examination dizzy patients examination important two reasons
first history clearly suggests one specific type dizziness physical examination directed specific pertinent organ systems
patient vertigo must undergo careful neurologic otologic examination clinical assessment spontaneous andor positional nystagmus essential see chapter
patient presyncope requires careful cardiac hemodynamic evaluation see chapter
disequilibrium demands thorough general neurologic examination specific emphasis ocular auditory proprioceptive function
lightheaded patient often anxious depressed satisfied unless thorough physical assessment excludes occasional organic causeanemia thyroid disease recurrent cardiac arrhythmias
second physical examination dizzy patient always include performance several dizziness simulation tests
drachman hart demonstrated usefulness tests achieved specific diagnoses patients listed table
practicing clinician admire rate success
drachman hart utilized sophisticated battery neuro otologic tests simple bedside maneuvers often suffice enumerated table
patient blood pressure pulse taken sequentially supine sitting standing positions
orthostatic hypotension common cause presyncope reproduction patient symptoms associated fall blood pressure upon assuming upright position establishes diagnosis
sometimes fall blood pressure delayed patient blood pressure pulse taken minutes standing andor brief walk
intravascular volume depletion certain drugs common causes orthostatic hypotension usually pulse rises blood pressure falls patients
disease autonomic nervous system cause pulse may rise blood pressure drops
patient gait romberg testing observed
disequilibrium disorders often diagnosed basis observations see chapters
vestibular function tested examining patient extraocular movements nystagmus performing nylen bárány maneuvers positional nystagmus vertigo see chapter
finally patient perform voluntary hyperventilation
patient placed supine position asked breathe deeply rapidly times per minute mouth long minutes continuously
patient told expect
many normal individuals develop mild lightheadedness hyperventilation maneuver thus useful simulates lightheadednessthe patient vertigo disequilibrium presyncope say feel
many lightheaded patients however chronic hyperventilators rapidly within seconds develop symptoms experience distresspanic fluttering eyelids awkward thoracic breathing patterns emerge patient spontaneously announce
dizziness
self realization important event among lightheaded patients see
dizziness simulation tests help several ways
often common specific diagnosis suspected basis patient history confirmed immediately
positional vertigo orthostatic hypotension hyperventilation often thus diagnosed without ado
tests provide experiential examples certain types dizziness allow refinement patient history type dizziness remains unclear
noted previously hyperventilation simulate lightheadedness romberg gait testing simulate disequilibrium
occasionally tests table
allow patient distinguish among superficially similar sensations
example vertigo disequilibrium commonly confused caloric testing see chapter produce vertigo patient distinguish two
patient rarely enthusiastic approach
lightheadedness presyncope often overlap subjectively potentiated valsalva maneuver mimic presyncope
patient squats seconds breathes forcefully sphygmomanometer tube pressure mm hg reached forced expiration maintained seconds
maneuver decreases cardiac output simulating impaired cerebral perfusion diminishing venous return heart
patient often feel faint
maneuver performed elderly patient cardiac cerebrovascular disease
tests rarely document specific diagnosis
noted caloric testing may useful see chapter
carotid sinus massage see chapter occasionally diagnose carotid sinus syncope
fistula testprecipitating vertigo introducing air patient ear pneumatic otoscopewill help diagnose perilymphatic fistula
conclusion history examination great majority dizzy patients confidently assigned one four categories outlined figure
differential diagnosis treatment depend specific type dizziness involved
additional discussion approach vestibular disease presyncope found chapters respectively
points patients disequilibrium lightheadedness discussed
see syncope chapter motor system gait chapter autonomic nervous system section v vertigo chapters discussion mechanisms dizziness
noted previously detailed general neurologic examination essential diagnosis disequilibrium syndrome multiple sensory deficits often cause
keys diagnosis disequilibrium
analysis patient gait
determining whether patient disequilibrium predictable episodically unpredictable
begin analysis gait romberg test
patient stands upright feet together arms sides
patient able maintain balance position asked close eyes
loss equilibrium eyes closed usually suggests disordered proprioceptive andor vestibular function abnormal romberg response eyes open closed usually cerebellar origin
next watch patient walk away turn return
gait patient multiple sensory deficits usually merely hesitant apprehensive minimal assistance cane companion renders gait fluid confident
type gait patient two major sensory deficits usually diagnostic
similar type gait seen elderly people multiple sensory deficits
senile gait associated senility dementia unfortunate label remains popular
patients gait unassisted scared slow minimally assisted may brisk assured
examiner observant may miss patient early parkinsonism frontal lobe apraxia
early course parkinsonismbefore appearance classic tremor cogwheel rigiditydisequilibrium difficulty walking common findings
stage gait slow arm swing diminished turning disproportionately clumsy
advanced stages parkinsonian gait festinating steps short tight feet shuffle along trunk bent forward arms hang motionless sides
likened appearance lower body shuffling frantically forward catch rest body
frontal lobe apraxia may subtly different gait thorough neurologic examination usually reveals evidence dementia frontal lobe signs patients
gait likened walking ice standing position patient difficulty initiating walk
steps shuffle get going patient knows walk know begin
gentle nudge elbow often greatest help people
turning especially instructive apraxic patient may appear stuck floor often pivoting around one stationary foot one legged
cerebellar ataxia severe peripheral neuropathy always easy recognize
ataxic patient bit subtlethe patient usually reels unsteadily short irregular steps feet held wide apart straddling invisible barrier often lurching side side falling especially attempting stop sit turn around
romberg test abnormal eyes open shut
peripheral neuropathy rarely severe enough cause disequilibrium common component multiple sensory deficit syndrome especially alcoholics diabetics
hallmark neuropathic gait patient must see walk since proprioceptive function deserted
patient often walks bent forward watching feet interact ground
sight superficially comical legs usually held apart foot flung forward often higher necessary stomped ground patient wearing frogman flippers
gait likened circus clown wearing oversized shoes
thus patients specific structural neurologic disorders suffer predictable disequilibrium gait always abnormal tested
patient multiple sensory deficits parkinsonism apraxia ataxia may good bad days gait never normal
contrast patients describe disequilibrium episodic unpredictable examination patients gait may unremarkable patient asymptomatic
common causes episodic disequilibrium various vestibular disorders transient cerebrovascular insufficiency metabolic disorders hyperventilation psychogenic disequilibrium
patients vestibular disease neither describe admit vertigo
especially true central vestibular disease see chapter acoustic nerve neoplasms multiple sclerosis drug alcohol anticonvulsants tranquilizers toxicity tumors brain stem cerebellum
much common peripheral vestibular disorders may also cause nonspecific sense disequilibrium especially elderly
careful neurologic examination always clue central disorder history disequilibrium induced positional head changes usually suggest atypical presentation peripheral disorder
transient attacks cerebrovascular ischemia may cause dizziness risk subsequent catastrophic stroke patients always makes clinician worry diagnosis elderly hypertensive patient episodic disequilibrium
fisher classic studies transient ischemic attacks help allay heighten worry remember several conclusions
carotid artery disease rarely causes dizziness disequilibrium isolated symptom
fact patients symptomatic carotid disease complained dizziness part symptom complex
thus example elderly patient carotid bruit describes episodic disequilibrium absence carotid ischemic symptoms likely two unrelated problems
disease posterior circulationthe posterior cerebral artery andor vertebrobasilar systemdoes commonly cause dizziness usually disequilibrium presyncopal type
however dizziness almost always accompanied symptomsdiplopia vertigo dysarthria limb weakness dysesthesias ataxia visual lossthat help incriminate brainstem posterior hemispheres
occasionally earliest manifestation transient ischemic attacks involving posterior circulation episodic dizziness alone fisher found episodic dizziness recurs weeks without neurologic manifestations never vascular origin
moreover dizziness accompanied eighth cranial nerve symptoms vertigo tinnitus deafness rarely vascular origin
fisher describe patients ischemic symptoms involving small internal auditory arteryisolated eighth nerve syndromes occur situation
finally positional vertigo disequilibriuman extremely common manifestation peripheral vestibular diseaseis never caused cerebrovascular ischemia
metabolic disorders remembered patient disequilibrium
always ask prescription nonprescription drugs used patient
many people fail make connection onset disequilibrium use new higher doses medication
hypothyroidism may cause dizziness ranging mild episodic disequilibrium frank ataxia
episodic hypoglycemia fashionable usually incorrect diagnosis among neurotic dizzy patients vague dizziness always temporally postprandial raise legitimate question
severe anemia may cause vague disequilibrium may hyponatremia adrenal insufficiency cause hypotension
hyperventilation extremely common cause intermittent disequilibrium even though lightheadedness usual complaint hyperventilators
reminder reemphasizes two important caveats patient disequilibrium fact dizzy patient
overlap among different subjective sensations dizziness specific disorder e g hyperventilation cause one general type dizziness
thus patient disequilibrium attributed one common causes disequilibrium described much likely patient fact suffers different type dizziness e g vertigo attendant differential diagnosis obscure cause disequilibrium
thus initial hypothesis patient type dizziness may incorrect
sometimes initial hypothesis must changedbased history dizziness simulation tests findings physical neurologic examination confirm hypothesis must look elsewhere
skeptical circumspect approach achieve kind results reported drachman hart table
four general scenarios pertain patient whose dizziness sounds lightheaded
patient dizzy e lightheaded time constantly
patient say yes dizzy right never really goes away
patients chronic hyperventilators brief hyperventilation dizziness simulation tests exacerbate andor reproduce symptoms
examination simulation tests normal patients usually suffer psychogenic lightheadedness almost always manifestation affective psychiatric disorder
difficult problem patient insists symptoms due feared organic illness extensive testing sometimes required convince patient otherwise
patient lightheaded intermittently unpredictably
patients also hyperventilators dizziness simulation tests establish diagnosis
voluntary hyperventilation unrevealing young apparently healthy patient often somatoform depressive illness elderly patient often problem since masked depression common cause recurrent cardiac arrhythmias atypical cerebrovascular symptoms excluded
patient lightheaded predictable reproducible pattern
listen carefully patient
never disregard patient opinion causes problem however unlikely may seem first glance
lightheadedness meals hungry may hypoglycemic
physical exercise may cause exertional lightheadedness patient severe anemia aortic stenosis pulmonary hypertension pericardial disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
positional lightheadedness may vestibular head position related orthostatic hypotension body position due carotid sinus stimulation neck position
manual laborer athlete artist becomes lightheaded using right left arm may looking disability sympathy may also describing subclavian steal syndrome
patient feels lightheaded urination may neurotic may also micturition presyncope even extra adrenal pheochromocytoma
symptoms reproducible history reproduce examination try understand possible mechanisms
patient lightheaded fact suffers disorder typically associated different type dizziness
associated symptoms often help concurrent tinnitus deafness suggest ménière disease another cochleovestibular disorder odd behavior automatisms retrograde amnesia postictal symptoms may point atypical temporal lobe epilepsy palpitations may reflect anxiety thyroid disease catecholamine excess primary cardiac disease
finally remain confused dizzy lightheaded patient nothing fits examination dizziness simulation tests unrevealing ask innocent personal questions life
happy
pressure home work
family well
marriage good
feel frightened often
depressed
get panicky good reason
seemingly ingenuous questions often open pandora box patient whose dizziness one somatic manifestation either deep personal distress frank psychiatric illness
