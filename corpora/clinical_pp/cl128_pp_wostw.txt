external nose supported paired nasal bones upper lateral lower lateral cartilages nasal septum
nasal skeleton skin subcutaneous tissue cartilage
nose therefore sustain frequent minor injuries
skin nose constantly exposed actinic effects skin neoplasms common
internal nose air conditioning organ body
normally purifies humidifies warms cools air entering lungs
poor nasal breathing leads mouth breathing secondary effects trachea bronchi lungs
lysozyme nasal mucus bacteriocidal
changes nasal ph lead decreased lysozyme ciliary activities subsequent nasal sinus infection
frontal maxillary antral ethmoid sinuses one side drain common sulcus middle meatus nose beneath middle turbinate
common drainage site leads contiguous spread infection usually beginning maxillary thence two sinus groups
external nose deformities often significant psychological effects
external deformities often indicate internal nasal deformities deviated nasal septum
small skin cancers nose must identified removed serious invasion occurs
