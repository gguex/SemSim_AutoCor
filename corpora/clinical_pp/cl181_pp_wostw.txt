flank pain sensation discomfort distress agony part body rib ilium generally beginning posteriorly midaxillary line resulting stimulation specialized nerve endings upon distention ureter renal capsule
similar pain sometimes caused extraurinary abnormalities
causes flank pain listed table
character flank pain helpful determining cause
important characteristics include local referred pain acute chronic recurrent pain degree severity duration
associated symptoms fever nausea vomiting atrial fibrillation often help making correct diagnosis
flank pain radiates ipsilateral testicle usually caused proximal ureteral renal pelvic obstruction due common innervation testicle renal pelvis
pain usually originates posterior part flank radiates testicle male labia female
pain becomes lower anterior flank obstruction occurs middle third ureter
pain still lower radiates scrotal skin rather testicle associated voiding symptoms urinary frequency urgency obstruction occurs level ureterovesical junction
degree severity pain directly related acuteness obstruction rather degree obstruction
therefore stone passes ureter suddenly becomes lodged one position usually causes extremely severe pain
flank pain mild absent presence severe chronic obstruction
mild chronic flank pain associated severe ureteral obstruction produce irreversible renal damage
stone passing ureter often cause severe intermittent pain
intermittent pain related obstruction produced stone becomes lodged ureter
therefore episode pain likely associated stone becoming lodged new distal position ureter
flank pain often associated less specific symptoms including fever nausea vomiting tachycardia
fever suggests infection proximal ureteral obstruction
flank pain associated fever requires prompt diagnosis ureteral obstruction relief obstruction infection proximal obstruction causes much rapid renal damage occurs obstruction absence infection
also patient susceptible septicemia presence infection proximal ureteral obstruction
gross microscopic hematuria helps confirm urinary cause pain
hematuria occasionally absent acute ureteral obstruction however often absent chronic obstruction
although ureteral stone common cause flank pain many causes considered see table
flank pain resulting acute ureteral obstruction also caused blood clots sloughed renal papillae passing ureter
blood clots produced many pathologic lesions kidney tumors common cause
renal papillary necrosis considered patients history analgesic abuse diabetes mellitus
flank pain caused chronic ureteral obstruction generally much less severe
occasionally congenital anomalies ureteropelvic junction obstruction produce flank pain associated diuresis oral intake large volume fluid
bilateral chronic ureteral obstruction ureteral obstruction solitary kidney associated symptoms renal failure apathy lethargy anorexia muscle twitching headache hypertension poor growth child
dull mild flank pain make clinician consider many possible causes including congenital ureteral obstruction ureteral tumor extrinsic tumor compressing ureter acquired stricture ureter due previous operation radiation therapy retroperitoneal fibrosis ureteral stone
flank pain caused renal inflammation generally sudden onset severe pain caused acute ureteral obstruction
renal inflammation usually produces localized pain associated manifestations infection fever leukocytosis bacteriuria
flank pain caused different types renal tumors pain common presenting symptom pain present often associated symptoms
hematuria common symptom seen tumors presenting adults abdominal mass common presenting symptom wilms tumor childhood
uncommon causes flank pain include renal trauma renal infarction vesicoureteral reflux even absence infection
renal infarction considered patients atrial fibrillation recent myocardial infarction
vesicoureteral reflux occasionally causes mild flank pain due distention ureter renal pelvis reflux occurs voiding
patient suspected analgesic abuser presents history acute severe flank pain uric acid stones previous reactions contrast media residence great distance away
physician fooled hematuria narcotic addicts find ways place blood urine specimens
extraurinary diseases abdomen chest also cause flank pain
diseases produce pain less characteristic typical renal colic seen acute ureteral obstruction
nevertheless vague dull mild flank pain similar pain seen chronic ureteral obstruction making differential diagnosis unclear
correct diagnosis made thinking diseases discussed considering associated symptoms physical examination urinalysis performing carefully selected laboratory tests radiographic studies
flank pain originating urinary system caused distention ureter renal pelvis distention renal capsule
severity pain directly related rapidity distention degree distention
therefore patient acute distention ureter extremely severe pain
patient usually mild dilation ureter irreversible renal damage
however patient greatly dilated ureter irreversible renal damage might pain mild pain ureteral dilation developed long period time
distention renal capsule causes milder flank pain
caused aucte pyelonephritis ureteral obstruction renal subcapsular hematoma
kidney ureteral pain visceral afferent fibers accompany sympathetic nerves lower thoracic upper lumbar segments
flank pain presenting symptom many significant diseases urinary system
ureteral obstruction recognized promptly especially associated infection order prevent renal damage
progression irreversible renal damage resulting ureteral obstruction related many factors including duration obstruction degree obstruction presence absence infection obstruction preexisting renal function status contralateral kidney age patient
obstructed kidney greater potential recovery contralateral kidney diminished function younger patient greater chance recovery function older patient
radiographic evaluation patient flank pain helps diagnose cause pain
physician consider diseases listed table
patient complains flank pain
diagnostic tests available assess urinary causes flank pain numerous beyond scope chapter
tests intravenous urography ultrasonography computerized tomography retrograde urography diuretic renography renal arteriography voiding cystourethrography
efficient cost effective evaluation flank pain done carefully selecting best diagnostic procedures based thorough history character flank pain associated aspects patient history
