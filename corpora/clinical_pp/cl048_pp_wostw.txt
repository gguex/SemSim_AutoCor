clinically important errors may occur steps abg measurements particularly vulnerable preanalytic errors
common problems include nonarterial samples air bubbles sample either inadequate excessive anticoagulant sample delayed analysis un cooled sample
proper blood sample abg analysis consists ml arterial specimen collected anaerobically peripheral artery ml plastic glass airtight syringe fitted small bore needle
air bubbles inadvertently introduced sampling must promptly evacuated

primary disturbances paco cause respiratory acid base disorders whereas primary alterations bicarbonate responsible metabolic derangements
primary disturbance elicits compensatory response usually incomplete returns ph toward normal
thus acidosis alkalosis necessarily result acidemia ph

simple acid base disorders illustrated table
mixed acid base disturbances result two simple disorders occurring together
complex recognition analysis predicated thorough understanding primary disorders
primary purposes respiration provide oxygen cells aerobic metabolism excrete carbon dioxide produced metabolic activity
requires integrated function respiratory system gas exchange alveolar air pulmonary capillary blood cardiovascular system gas transport metabolizing tissues
respiratory system may divided two parts respiratory pump lung
respiratory pump includes thoracic cage abdomen respiratory muscles respiratory control centers neural interconnections
major function respiratory pump ventilation lung whereas primary role lung gas transfer
factors influence gas exchange lung include movement gas lung ventilation blood flow lung perfusion regional distributions ventilation perfusion ventilation perfusion matching diffusion across alveolar capillary membrane
overall adequacy gas exchange oxygen carbon dioxide reflected pao paco
carbon dioxide major product oxidative metabolism transported lung venous blood eliminated alveolar ventilation
paco directly proportional carbon dioxide excretion rate co inversely proportional alveolar ventilation

therefore paco index adequacy alveolar ventilation relation carbon dioxide production
alveolar ventilation portion total minute ventilation e participates effectively gas exchange
remainder minute ventilation reaches anatomic physiologic dead space participate gas exchange called dead space ventilation
alveolar ventilation total minute ventilation minus dead space ventilation
alveolar ventilation may fall due decrease minute ventilation normal dead space due increase dead space ventilation without compensatory increase minute ventilation
oxygen essential aerobic metabolism
