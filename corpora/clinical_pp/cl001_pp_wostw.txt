one solve problem without first determining exists
earliest stages history clinician elicits chief complaint health concerns
technique symptom problem listing provides interviewer diagnostic leads generate hypotheses assists prioritizing patient concerns problem solver grasp big picture appreciate potential interrelationship various symptoms problems identified
another advantage symptom listing may avoid dilemma posed patient positive review systems
symptoms evaluated analyzed problems frequently uncovered
consider patient presents joint pains
review problem physician learns salicylate therapy alleviated symptoms discontinued
querying patient discloses episode black stools
thus additional problem melena identified
obviously correlate symptom listing physical laboratory areas
however problems identified fashion similar patient melena
example clinician interviewed patient chest pain strong suspicion represents angina pectoris
routine cardiac examination patient found systolic crescendo decrescendo murmur heard best second right intercostal space radiating carotid vessels
heretofore aortic stenosis problem
laboratory consider woman presents peripheral edema
neither history physical examination supports cardiac hepatic venous renal cause
preliminary laboratory investigation includes obtaining serum albumin level test hypothesis decreased colloid oncotic pressure liver disease urinalysis confirm eliminate possibility nephrotic syndrome
negative urine contain moderate amounts glucose
possibility diabetes mellitus enters patient medical profile
formulation revision hypotheses constant features diagnostic reasoning pervade entire encounter fig
somewhat contrary commonly believed since hypothesis generation usually ascribed history
hypotheses may general refer topographic parts anatomy domains organ system region channel foci subset domain
domains diseased certain symptoms signs emanate
hypotheses may specific well refer certain explicatory sets table
sets may categorized disorders congestive heart failure derangements myocardial infarction pathoanatomic entities coronary thrombosis pathophysiologic entities hyperlipoproteinemia
specific symptom sign elicited better chance activating specific hypotheses
instance nausea inspiratory rales elevated sedimentation rate nonspecific whereas syncope gallop heavy proteinuria specific
latter three examples evoke narrow differential diagnosis
clinical manifestations may even pathognomonic one hypothesis fits
consider significance paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea cheyne stokes respirations arterial plaque fundus etc
seasoned practitioner reliably generates specific hypotheses
hypothesis generation predicated informed intuition
imaginative great extent subconscious
frequently armed mere knowledge age sex chief complaint clinician entertain general specific hypotheses implicate common reversible even exotic disease states
fact early hypothesis generation rule
nevertheless readily achievable case familiar
conversely unfamiliar case effective hypothesis generation often delayed higher percentage complete data base collected
latter situation best concentrate topographic explicatory sets
typically hypotheses entertained time
clinical findings elicited medical interview physical examination generates hypotheses positive laboratory data contribute little generation new hypotheses
usually laboratory procedures utilized confirm reject hypotheses
number hypotheses generated depends experience clinician
strategy clinician obtains patient story performs core physical laboratory examinations order clarify refine hypotheses generated date
major elements hypothesis evaluation characterization choosing manifestations thinking
ultimately contribute meaningful way reformulation hypotheses appropriate analysis later
point identification problems generation hypotheses
order resolve problem unknown cause often case bedside physician confronted decision either search nonbiased manner information hypothesis evaluation proceed directly hypothesis analysis
option evaluation grants potential convert open ended problem one defined history dramatically increases probability eliciting affirmative responses significantly greater value directly testing hypotheses
one resorts hypothesis analysis immediately certain risk assume
one hand problem question may solved promptly
result negative particularly helpful however premature closure likely little accomplished
following two cases illustrative year old man presents progressive dyspnea
doubt topographic hypotheses cardiac pulmonary causes dyspnea come mind immediately
perhaps explicatory set hypotheses chronic obstructive pulmonary disease congestive heart failure entertained
hypothesis evaluation dictates physician obtain clearer picture dyspnea determining circumstances characteristics dyspnea
whereas hypothesis analysis would cause clinician query patient immediately tobacco usage prior history myocardial infarction etc
second case year old man consults physician anorexia weight gain increased abdominal girth
strong suspicion heavy alcohol intake
examining physician may choose evaluate patient thoroughly careful methodical examination core systems resort hypothesis driven examination supraclavicular fossae palpated neoplastic nodes abdomen inspected distention ascites palpated masses hepatosplenomegaly fluid wave ascites skin checked spider angiomas breasts examined gynecomastia testicles palpated atrophy
latter three represent direct testing potential complications alcoholism
hallmarks characterization chronology severity influential factors expert witness
chronology applicable interview crux present illness
virtually every pathophysiologic process beginning intermediate stage current status clinical manifestation disease
frequently determining chronology symptom carries clinical significance diagnostic purposes
consider implications year old woman intermittent disabling headaches years versus patient suffered similar headaches last weeks
severity index magnitude progression impact disease patient lifestyle
technique assists clarification process immeasurably
reflect significance following patient extertional nonexertional chest pain consumes sublingual trinitroglycerin tablets per day unable work patient longstanding peptic ulcer disease presents exacerbation physical examination found marked epigastric involuntary guarding patient progressive dyspnea whose pulmonary function testing reveals marked airflow obstruction parameters
precipitating events alleviating elements exacerbating stimuli associated symptoms signs form components influential factors
well known aspects symptom characterization present illness perhaps appreciated performing physical examination maneuvers laboratory procedures
instance examining elderly woman injured hip fall palpation observation reveal pain partially alleviated hip flexion exacerbated movements associated signs adductor muscle spasm external rotation hip
laboratory year old man presents substernal pressure like chest pain occurring commonly rest exertion
physical examination resting electrocardiogram normal
treadmill electrocardiogram mm st depression developed inferior leads precipitated one episode six beat atrial tachycardia observed associated changes reverted baseline minutes completion procedure alleviated
expert witness technique method validate collect additional information diagnostic importance assist determination severity
physician implements strategy interview patient communicating family friends ambulance technicians nurses etc physical laboratory examinations requesting informal formal second opinion consultations colleagues
distinct advantages diagnostic therapeutic framework critical finding confirmed trusted associate
asymmetry supraclavicular fossae
nevus suspicious neoplasm
see infiltrate lingula
atypical lymphocytes
result exchange clinical certainty increased probability premature closure lessened
constant interplay characterization choosing manifestations
latter intermediate step hypothesis evaluation symptoms signs problems translated medically meaningful terms appropriate pathophysiological significance
two categories exist choosing manifestations labeling deviance
labeling permits matching symptoms signs accepted medical terminology
accuracy depends clinician patient ability perceive interact respond individual verbal comments
examining patient physician psychomotor skills perception interpretation findings necessary label correctly
frequently describing inscribing physical findings expressed literally interpretative statement made
term spider angiomas quite adequately completely accounts description multiple erythematous dot like lesions serpiginous processes radiating several different directions blanch pressure refill centrally pressure released
exception situation findings labeled clinician knowledgeable enough
laboratory study process physical examination despite fact labeling may province consultant
example radiologic procedure would probably interpreted expertly radiologist
obviously many pitfalls errors labeling process complex subjective dynamic
technique deviance applies understanding ranges normalcy abnormality assessing significance symptoms signs evaluated
discussion laboratory normal ranges contained elsewhere book
considerable difficulty assigning normalcy abnormality clinical manifestations collected history physical
physician challenge history depends clinical skills zeal biases also patient level cooperation memory
thus without attention details misperceptions verbal misstatements occur
likewise signs elicited physical examination best semiquantitative
danger course either overinterpretation underinterpretation manifestations
consequences former needless worry unnecessary investigations operations treatments excessive costs
opposite situation underlying disease detected
rarely difficulty determining abnormal state marked deviations normal exist
manifestation less severe clinician dilemma
wonder items history physical reviewed repeated laboratory procedure reordered advanced level test invasive costly nature requested
furthermore situations typically result soliciting second opinions experts
whether soliciting response history performing physical examination maneuver utilizing laboratory test physician proceeds open ended data collection mode characterization direct specific ones hypothesis analysis
implicit definition either yes response history positive negative result physical laboratory examinations
although clinical experience knowledge pathophysiology central aspect patient physician encounter infinitely essential testing hypotheses
frequently clinicians may characterize topographic based hypotheses mind impossible analyze without explanatory sets relating explicit entities etiologies complications hand
intellectual preparatory mechanisms embodied analyzing result questions maneuvers procedures reflect synthesis development creativity
employing strategy clinician focuses solidifying refuting hypotheses entertained
reward yes response positive negative result justifies inherent risk assumed thwarting spontaneous symptom related statements patient sacrificing detailed evaluation every aspect physical laboratory examinations
danger premature closure longer factor
presence symptom problem physical sign already localized domain focus requires search symptoms signs present may manifestations disease domain
explorative direct questioning examining nondirective manner
clinician assumes pursuing symptoms signs within system likely yield positive results embarking questioning examining process unrelated system area
also compensates physician fallibility remembering recognizing disease patterns provides additional thinking time permits one rule remote even common possibilities
strategy depends basic fund knowledge related etiologies complications disease processes
context one applies principles history physical laboratory medicine resolve patient problems pervasive primary concern affix causality
essence physician expectations problem solver
inherent utilizing technique pathophysiology question maneuver procedure effected without specific hypothetical explicatory set mind figure table
searching etiological clues assists clinician isolating problem according pathoanatomic pathophysiologic entities whereas seeking complications facilitates focusing derangements disorders
note latter two explicatory sets explain symptoms signs rarely ever account ultimate causation
instance determining patient paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea theory congestive heart failure responsible symptom
disorder however congestive heart failure complication basic disease mechanism perhaps myocardial infarction secondary atherosclerosis may caused acquired hyperlipidemia etc
particular subsection hypothesis analysis addresses techniques transcend purity diagnostic reasoning
preceding sections goal strictly pursuit diagnosis
concept clinician priority attempts focus diagnostic process practical perspective clinical medicine
techniques utilized subconsciously throughout encounter rarely appreciated clinician
represent art medicine picking game strategies one assimilates perhaps osmosis clinical training apprenticeships continuing professional experience
five categories urgency uncertainty threshold reversibility commonness
clinician acts urgency presence particular symptom sign implies immediate diagnostic therapeutic intervention indicated
action oriented
attention directed toward acutely ill potentially acutely ill may serious life threatening fatal diseases
accordingly uncommon entities may ranked higher greater frequency occurrence
mind easy comprehend physician chooses elicit presence rigors patient fever dysuria flank pain patient bacteremic
dedicates moments observe patient carefully pilo erection decreased skin perfusion
even occasions search particular complication hypovolemia diarrhea provides much stronger stimulus clinician cause diarrhea
coping uncertainty bedside universal
plagues physician protects patient
basically strategy forces one collect historical physical examination laboratory data may necessary consequences diagnostic error without great
decision must made level uncertainty tolerable
challenge conservative avoid errors omission
fear clinical consequences attendant penalties enable clinicians effective
unfortunately excessive reliance laboratory medicine
infinitely acceptable implement strategy uncertainty fullest history taking physical examination patient risk virtually nonexistent necessarily judicious utilizing laboratory procedures
threshold converse uncertainty
point data could collected neither positive negative response would contribute analytic process change predictive value significantly
uncertainty prevails critical point remaining doubt tolerated
dilemma whether continue driven uncertainty invoke threshold
threshold set high redundant often needless information sought
set low physician may negate opportunity make diagnosis institute therapy
emphasis reversibility treatability embodies essence medicine cure patient
relevant data must collected aid therapeutic decision making
presented two competing hypotheses one greatest potential treatment ranked higher
payoff greater
following case exemplifies year old man progressively worsening dyspnea years without associated wheezing
physical examination reveals findings compatible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
pulmonary function spirometry without bronchodilators ordered despite fact patient clinical evidence irreversible disease
hoped reactive obstructive component responsive bronchodilator therapy uncovered
adage common things common aptly describes technique commonness
techniques discussed previously likely clinician awareness
issue one good sense
helpful entertain uncommon hypothesis unless good reason invoking urgency uncertainty
thus patient abdominal pain pancreatitis consideration collect data symptoms relevant renal disease emboli vasculitis etc appropriate investigate presence symptoms cholelithiasis alcohol intake account cases acute pancreatitis
similarly patient enlarging abdomen swollen ankles much higher priority check signs cardiac hepatic diseases opposed implicating inferior vena cava obstruction
process involves consolidation clinical data refinement modification diagnostic possibilities assist solidifying hypotheses refuting distinguishing two likely candidates
elimination enables one disprove hypothesis convincing manner seeking negative responses results questions maneuvers high sensitivity true positive rate given hypothesis
thus difficult entertain seriously diagnosis infectious mononucleosis without sore throat reactive airway disease without prolonged expiration nephrotic syndrome patient without proteinuria
discriminating two closely related hypotheses frequent challenge
patient several episodes hematochezia determining whether blood outside stool mixed stool helps distinguish anal disease luminal pathology proximal anus
comparable example physical examination attempting transilluminate scrotal mass laboratory arena ordering serum gamma glutamyltransferase patient elevated alkaline phosphatase
finally confirmation one attempts clinch diagnosis seeking clinical manifestations high specificity despite fact one bits data already support
thus discerning patient low back pain radiates thigh lateral calf suggestive radiculopathy
determining pain associated numbness exacerbated coughing sneezing straining even convincing
similarly physical examination patient dyspnea exertion findings peripheral edema hepatomegaly inspiratory rales distended neck veins support contention left sided heart failure cause finding gallop definitive confirms suspicion
element sequential strategic process diagnostic reasoning encompasses synthesis integration multiple clinical clues vast amount data collected
assembling governed principle hierarchical organizational structure facts exists scheme diagnosis
stimuli reduce scope problem sort complexities encountered date
ultimately working problem list developed guide investigative pursuits therapeutic management
functional problem list must coherent adequate context patient evaluated
history taking hypothesis assembling encompasses formulation narrowed set hypotheses permit characterization analysis physical examination laboratory testing
conclusion physical examination clues elicited manifestations history physical undergo process direct laboratory data collection
finally appropriate laboratory tests completed problem list transformed refined product impressions diagnoses
many positive negative items elicited bedside relevant must filtered
pertinence determines normal abnormal manifestations retained disregarded require attention
general findings pathophysiological significance especially high clinician priority kept
likewise symptoms signs retained potential inclusion particular explicatory set
example year old man day history nausea vomiting daily diarrhea five ten times daily headache nasal stuffiness dizziness
treated antibiotics carbuncle weeks ago past history left inguinal herniorrhaphy cholecystectomy
physical examination mm hg orthostatic drop systolic blood pressure poor skin turgor scarred tympanic membranes anisocoria gallop right upper quadrant left inguinal scars active bowel sounds diffuse abdominal tenderness perianal erythema perianal skin tag mildly enlarged prostate
headache nasal stuffiness left inguinal herniorrhaphy scarred tympanic membranes anisocoria etc pertinent
truly clinical problems worthy note time
clustering lumping aggregation several symptoms signs recognizable patterns fit sets disorders derangements pathoanatomic entities pathophysiologic entities
may related one another cause effect dependent clustering virtue clinical significance independent clustering
former category polyuria polydipsia polyphagia classic symptoms diabetes mellitus
osmotic effect glucose responsible polyuria calorie loss cause polydipsia polyphagia
independent category one cluster orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea distended neck veins positive hepatojugular reflux gallop peripheral edema umbrella congestive heart failure
lumping consistent law parsimony dictates clinicians make diagnoses possible
monopathic reasoning
frequently patients many positive symptoms signs
whereas clustering supports economy diagnosis splitting promotes polypathic reasoning retention certain clinical manifestations separate problem entities inappropriate aggregation may jeopardize diagnostic therapeutic processes
dilemma posed physicians splitting similar uncertainty respects
fear missing diagnosis
year old patient described pertinence orthostatic hypotension found physical examination
high probability objective sign caused vomiting diarrhea
thus could lumped together cause effect
however clinician risk excluding completely separate important problem namely extracellular volume depletion
splitting prevents happening
problem listing identification formalized working set symptoms signs aggregated symptoms signs well hypothesized derangements disorders
either lumping splitting clinician must account positive findings elicited history physical laboratory sections patient evaluation
order qualify listing must importance diagnostically therapeutically
referring patient described earlier original laboratory work revealed azotemia blood urea nitrogen mgdl creatinine
mgdl hypoalbuminemia albumin
gdl elevated alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase ul hyperuricemia uric acid
mgdl moderate stool leukocytes
thus appropriate problem list patient end history might include diarrhea headache dizziness prior surgeries
physical examination list might revised state diarrhea dizziness prior surgeries extracellular volume depletion perianal erythema mildly enlarged prostate
knowledge laboratory data refined version might listed accordingly inflammatory diarrhea extracellular volume depletion dizziness perianal erythema mildly enlarged prostate azotemia hypoalbuminemia hyperuricemia elevated alkaline phosphatase
obviously patient problems totally resolved certainly narrowed point focused supportive therapy administered second line hypothesis driven laboratory testing planned ultimately confirm definitive diagnoses
collecting analyzing data involve problem identification generation general specific hypotheses methodical information gathering evaluation analysis assembling pertinent clinical clues problems direct investigation treatment
process continuum quite dynamic
never seems end patient host disease changing variables
clinician must proceed flexible manner throughout entire framework based judgment learned behavior knowledge pathophysiologic principles
