pharynx space shared respiratory system digestive tract
divided three areas nasopharynx oropharynx hypopharynx
nasopharynx belongs entirely respiratory tract located behind nose
anteriorly nasopharynx defined posterior choanae nose superiorly anterior inferior wall sphenoid sinus posteriorly vertebral bodies cervical spine
nasopharynx opens interiorly oropharynx distal edge soft palate posterior pharyngeal wall
lymphoid tissue known adenoids pharyngeal tonsils occupies posterosuperior surface nasopharynx part larger collection lymphoid tissue known waldeyer ring
oropharynx opens anteriorly oral cavity interiorly hypopharynx level base tongue
lateral walls occupied faucial palatine tonsils lie two folds tissue anterior tonsillar pillar palatoglossal fold posterior pillar palato pharyngeal fold
hypopharynx extends base tongue apex pyriform sinuses
pyriform sinuses recesses formed larynx thyroid cartilages larynx extend beyond larynx
pyriform sinuses serve funnel food hypopharynx esophagus
examination nasopharynx difficult requires special equipment
simplest way use small mirror headlight tongue blade
tongue depressed firmly tongue blade patient instructed breathe nose
mirror positioned throat small portion nasopharynx seen
mirror rotated gently examine portions nasopharynx
care must taken touch posterior pharyngeal wall cause patient gag
small fiberoptic scope another method often used examine nasopharynx
scope passed nose alter anesthetized topical anesthetic nasopharynx
areas examined
even nasopharynx seen either method presence mucus obscures mucosal surface irregular surface adenoidal tissue makes interpretation difficult
oropharynx examined tongue blade good light
tongue blade placed center tongue junction anterior two thirds posterior one third tongue
tongue firmly depressed exposing pharynx
examiner note presence absence palatine tonsils size
tonsils irregular surface deep crypts often filled epithelial debris lymphocytes particularly infected
examiner also note symmetry palato tonsil area
bulging one side contralateral shifting uvula may indicative peritonsillar abscess parapharyngeal tumor
posterior pharyngeal wall site collection lymphoid tissue spread surface
lymphoid tissue becomes hypertrophied upper respiratory infections cobble stoned appearance
hypopharynx examined mirror headlight
patient positioned sniffing position leaning forward slightly
tongue protruded held examiner fingers
gauze sponge placed tip tongue provides better grip tongue gently pulled forward
mirror carefully inserted mouth placed left right uvula soft palate
palate lifted single movement mirror reflected hypopharynx
patient instructed say eeee tenses laryngeal musculature causes epiglottis move anteriorly exposing endolarynx
care taken touch posterior wall pharynx cause patient gag
gagging problem local anesthetic sprayed posterior pharyngeal wall reduce
examiner examine entire hypopharynx including epiglottis pyri forni sinuses larynx
movement symmetry vocal cords noted well irregularity laryngeal mucosa
true vocal cords covered squamous epithelium instead respiratory epithelium like rest larynx reflect light differently giving cords white coloration
trachea sometimes examined carina clinician alert possible airway obstruction lesion subglottic airway
role pharynx conduit digestive respiratory tract brings contact external environment makes susceptible various allergens microorganisms carcinogenic substances present
inflammation pharynx usually produces pain sore throat sensory innervation provided largely vagus nerve
pain throat often accompanied otalgia actually referred pain produced concomitant vagal innervation external ear
many symptoms physical findings pharynx produced lymphoid tissue known waldeyer ring common area
nasopharynx hypertrophy adenoidal tissue produce nasal obstruction interfere postnasal drainage mucus produced nose sinuses
may lead infections middle ear sinuses
oropharynx lymphoid tissue known palatine tonsils deep crypts surface harbor bacteria secretions lead tonsillitis
size tonsils vary greatly
size alone specific pathologic significance depends greatly age patient whether inflammation infection present
general tonsils quite prominent children tonsil enlargement continues puberty tonsils tend atrophy
tonsillar hypertrophy time common persons upper respiratory allergy recurrent tonsillitis
lymphoid tissue base tongue lingual tonsils also become infected hypertrophied produce pain feeling lump throat vallecula space filled
hypopharynx generally void lymphoid tissue
sore throat one common complaints seen physicians offices
differential diagnosis would include inflammation due allergy infection due viral bacterial agents physical irritation due postnasal drainage reflux esophagitis neoplasm
diagnosis depends integration information obtained history physical examination laboratory data throat culture barium swallow
acute pharyngitis usually viral origin may caused group beta streptococcus
infections usually accompanied fever cervical lymphadenitis
acute tonsillitis also may accompany pharyngitis usually obvious appearance tonsils studded purulent material crypts may covered mucopurulent exudate
malignant neoplasms occur area pharynx squamous cell carcinomas occur result tobacco use
nasopharynx much less often involved areas people except chinese race
group nasopharyngeal carcinoma accounts almost malignancies
reason clear probably combination genetic environmental factors
addition squamous cell carcinomas presence minor salivary glands pharynx lead development salivary gland neoplasms benign malignant
