mean corpuscular volume mcv mean corpuscular hemoglobin mch mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc first introduced wintrobe define size mcv hemoglobin content mch mchc red blood cells
termed red cell indices values useful elucidating etiology anemias
red cell indices calculated values hemoglobin hematocrit packed cell volume red blood cell count known
general availability electronic cell counters red cell indices automatically measured blood count determinations
variation size red cells anisocytosis quantified expressed red cell distribution width rdw red cell morphology index
rdw widely available discussed chapter
size distribution population cells graphically represented red cell histograms price jones curves see figure
similar histograms also available white blood cells platelets
mcv defines size red blood cells expressed femtoliters fl cubic microns mm
normal values mcv ± fl
mch quantifies amount hemoglobin per red blood cell
normal values mch ± picograms pg per cell
mchc indicates amount hemoglobin per unit volume
contrast mch mchc correlates hemoglobin content volume cell
expressed gdl red blood cells percentage value
normal values mchc ± gdl
rdw represents coefficient variation red blood cell volume distribution size expressed percentage
normal value rdw ±
red cell indices mcv mch mchc calculated hemoglobin hematocrit red blood cell count follows
clinical laboratories use automated machines perform blood counts commonly called cbc include red cell indices part profile
two types automated machines generally used
instruments like coulter model employ principle electric impedance others like hemalog system analyzer use optical methods performing cell counts
automated machines give following values white cell count red cell count platelet count hemoglobin hematocrit mcv mch mchc
newer machines capable calculating rdw red cell morphology index mean platelet volume absolute lymphocyte count differential white cell count ate used many clinical laboratories
instruments also capable producing histograms
automated cell counters fast convenient precise certain conditions interfere machine calculations result spurious values
important clinicians become familiar common causes spurious results electronic counters table
red cell agglutination doublet erythrocytes counted one larger clumps counted red blood cells
leads decrease red cell count falsely elevated mcv
determination hemoglobin value affected
prewarming sample eliminates spurious values
hyperglycemia red cells transiently hypertonic relation isotonic diluting fluid resulting swollen cells elevated mcv
avoided time allowed equilibration dilution
hemoglobin quantified based absorption characteristics
conditions hyperlipidemias hyperbilirubinemia high white blood cell count high serum protein interfere measurement result falsely elevated hemoglobin values
presence immunoglobulins fibrinogen precipitated low temperatures blood sample leads interference cell counts resulting spuriously increased white blood cell count sometimes small elevations hemoglobin hematocrit red blood cell count slight decrease mcv
prewarming sample °c correct artificial values
values hemoglobin red cell count mcv affected mch mchc also become abnormal since indices calculated directly measured
sometimes set spurious values may first clue otherwise unsuspected clinical condition e g combination low hematocrit normal hemoglobin high mcv mchc characteristic cold agglutinins
mcv since average value normal presence two different cell populations e g dimorphic anemias red cell fragmentation reticulocyte response
therefore important examine peripheral smear evaluation anemias
available rdw good indicator degree anisocytosis
similarly red cell histogram offers graphic depiction red cell size distribution reveal anisocytosis even mcv normal
erythropoiesis process erythroid maturation involves progressive condensation nuclear chromatin termed nuclear maturation finally extrusion cell synthesis hemoglobin cytoplasm termed cytoplasmic maturation concomitant reduction cell size due division water loss
defects nuclear maturation seen megaloblastic anemias due folate b deficiency result large oval erythrocytes macroovalocytes normal hemoglobin content
mcv mch increased mchc remains normal
anisocytosis rdw often increased
macrocytosis liver disease defect nuclear maturation cells large due excess red cell membrane
cells round rather oval rdw normal
defective hemoglobin synthesis results small cells low mcv without anisocytosis
heterozygous b thalassemias cells uniformly small low mcv rdw tends normal whereas iron deficiency anisocytosis increased rdw may first laboratory abnormality even anemia microcytosis seen
abnormalities involving nuclear maturation hemoglobin production proceeds normally cell division lags behind ultimately leading larger normal cell
contrast defective delayed synthesis hemoglobin continued cell division leads microcytosis
anemias may classified based etiology e g hemolytic hemorrhagic etc erythropoietic response e g hypoproliferative ineffective cell morphology e g macrocytic microcytic hypochromic
red cell indices valuable morphologic classification anemias
since different etiologic factors result characteristically different red cell morphology clinician properly plan management patient anemia interpret blood counts peripheral blood smear well
anemias classified according size red cell normocytic normal mcv macrocytic increased mcv microcytic decreased mcv
microcytic anemias also often described hypochromic based peripheral smear examination mchc value determined manually
mchc measured electronic machines mostly normal microcytic anemias however value mch closely parallels value mcv
optical properties small thin microcytes make appear hypochromic blood smear hemoglobin concentration remains normal range microcytic normochromic anemias
hyperchromic anemias
spherocytosis mchc increased due loss membrane consequent spherical shape assumed cell
general availability rdw measure anisocytosis helps evaluation anemias based morphology see table
significant anisocytosis often leads increased rdw whereas absence rdw remains normal
pointed evaluation anemias complete without careful examination well prepared peripheral blood smear
red cell indices rdw red blood cell histograms help identify conditions red cell inclusions e g malarial parasites membrane abnormalities spherocytosis might responsible anemia
