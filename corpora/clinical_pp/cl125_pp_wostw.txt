hoarseness abnormal voice characteristic voice coarse breathy quality
usually benign self limited may early indication vocal cord carcinoma
presented patient hoarseness examiner determine duration hoarseness circumstances associated onset
one common causes traumatic use voice yelling shouting football game chronic overuse voice case professional singer
smoking history also obtained since traumatic factor well risk factor development malignancies aerodigestive tract
upper respiratory infection coryza fever cough another common cause considered
patient thyroid surgery neck surgery vagus recurrent laryngeal nerve may injured
history reflux esophagitis symptoms might suggest hoarseness related bathing posterior portion larynx acidic gastric fluidsan recognized common condition
examiner inquire pain difficulty swallowing proximity larynx hypopharynx esophagus areas share common neurologic supply
larynx guardian airway
function provide passage air enter tracheobronchial tree prevent passage food saliva swallowed substances entering airway provide sound source phonation
true vocal cords actually muscles stretched across top trachea arranged v configuration
major motor nerve supply vocal cords recurrent laryngeal nerve branch vagus
sides nerves pass jugular foramen base skull neck upper chest vagus nerve ascend back neck groove esophagus trachea recurrent laryngeal nerves
location vulnerable injury thyroid surgery
inspiration angle cords widens cords abduct angle decreases cords adduct phonation swallowing
sound created vibration free edge cords occurs expired air forced adducted cords
repeated forceful vocal cord adduction high velocity expiratory airflow occurs shouting injurious vocal cords
hoarseness may develop generalized swelling producing small intramucosal hematoma point maximum amplitude vibration free edge cord
hematoma become organized go form small nodule called singer nodule
anything interferes vibration free edge cord produces incomplete closure glottis cause hoarseness
includes benign vocal cord lesions polyps papillomas malignant lesions carcinoma neurologic dysfunction injury vagus specifically recurrent laryngeal nerve
hoarseness results benign causes acute laryngitis transient self limited
clinical importance hoarseness may early sign vocal cord carcinoma potentially curable lesion
patient hoarseness greater weeks duration examined via indirect laryngoscopy mirror direct fiberoptic examination office procedures
vocal cord lesion found patient may require direct laryngoscopy biopsy
