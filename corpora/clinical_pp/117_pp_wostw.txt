funduscopic examination routine part every doctor examination eye ophthalmologist
consists exclusively inspection
one looks ophthalmoscope figure simply light various optical modifications including lenses
ophthalmoscope illuminates retina normal iris defect pupil
light rays forming image retina emerge pupil
viewing aperture window ophthalmoscope contains lens modifies light rays assist user
procedure one looks structures lying innermost aspect globe collectively known eyegrounds retina retinal blood vessels optic nerve head disk limited degree subjacent choroid
pupil frequently dilated pharmacologically render retinal inspection easier examination macula
one paralyzes pupilloconstrictor muscle iris nonabsorbable short acting topical parasympatholytic drugs resulting larger pupillary aperture
comparison ophthalmologist internist neurologist pediatrician concentrates particularly funduscopic manifestations systemic disease less local ocular disease
synonyms funduscopic examination include funduscopy ophthalmoscopy direct ophthalmoscopy
ophthalmologists perform retinoscopy indirect ophthalmoscopy require equipment provide different information
term temporal used describing ophthalmoscopic landmarks findings rather lateral nasal replaces medial
optic nerve head disk seen one looks pupil angle degrees temporal optical axis patient line sight straight ahead
disk yellow pink color stands redder browner orange retina proper see figure
disk sharply demarcated temporally lesser degree nasally background retina retina disk vessels macula
frequently narrow crescent stippled pigment adjoins sides disk especially temporal side house staff called author see lesions turned normal feature
disk slightly taller wide
central part disk paler called optic cup physiologic excavation normally occupies less one third diameter disk
glaucoma high myopia cup enlarged
transverse diameter disk standard yardstick fundal description example lesion may characterized one half disk diameter two oclock extending two disk diameters superiorly therefrom
although examiners realize disk
mm wide nobody describes lesion mm across
near mid disk central retinal artery vein emerge optic nerve run forward orbit
soon bifurcates superior inferior branches run flat parallel retinal surface
beyond one disk diameter called arterioles venules
retinal vessels arteryarteriole appears slightly smaller distinctly lighter orange red less purple veinvenule
color difference reflects contained blood column visualized vascular walls transparent deoxygenated venous blood darker arterial blood
crosses disk edge large vessel divides nasal temporal branch
thus principal arteries veins quadrants retina superior temporal inferior temporal inferior nasal superior nasal
avascular dusky area two disk diameters due temporal disk macula
area greatest visual acuity
apart zone background retinal color parallel patient skin hair pigmentation pale light skinned blondes umber shade darkest black people
normally largest veins pulsate slightly arteries reverse situation elsewhere body
hemorrhage seen normal fundi
yellow yellow white gray black interruptions background retinal color pattern suggest pathologic exudate edema scar
wrinkling retina seen
chalky whiteness erythema disk abnormal indistinct disk margins
sharp change elevation renders one area focus ophthalmoscope remainder retina remains focus abnormal
tortuous blood vessels usually bespeak pathology
spend time becoming accustomed looking ophthalmoscope nonpressured setting
hold instrument hand ipsilateral examining eye ipsilateral eye examined examine every left fundus left eye holding ophthalmoscope left hand figure every right fundus right eye hand
students strong dominance one eye may first experience difficulty anguish employing eye
always gain success comfort time
forefinger turns horizontal rheostat vertical lens wheel
portion lens wheel containing single lens overlies window given setting
lenses red numbers negative diopter values progressively distant focusing higher numbers black numbers positive e higher black numbers mean shorter focal length
several light beams available two plain white circles important generalist
larger illuminates wider field smaller decreases corneal glare
hold instrument bony orbit bumper ridge forehead
practice show focus
ophthalmoscope magnify images except slightly high positive diopters
rather fundus appears magnified funduscopy magnification produced patient lens aphakic fundi look tiny far away ophthalmoscope
practice turning head craning neck every way maintaining constant relationship eye hand instrument
viewing aperture moved mm optical axis mean loss half available field make spatial relations constant though yoked
lower room lights
remove patient eyeglasses contact lenses
patient hold glasses put someplace safe
give patient tissue case tearing
show patient spot directly ahead fix gaze
object picture ahead perfect
able fixate eye examined e blocked spotlighted examiner
interview ophthalmoscopy people involuntarily turn eyes toward speaker end visualization
hold ophthalmoscope eye see well
keep eye open ignore input
begin light two thirds strength
stand degrees temporal patient optical axis eye cm
set lens wheel diopters
trans illuminate pupil observe reflected red light red reflex
place contralateral palm forehead abducted thumb supraorbital ridge prevent accidentally bumping brow eye instrument
doctors advocate using thumb help hold eye open patients hate resist
colleague try need convincing
slowly move toward patient slowly decreasing diopters toward zero increasing focal length
way focus successively cornea lens vitreous finally retina
appearance black spots point tells opacities path light accounted circumvented inspecting retina
wind instrument cm patient eye
see retina look first distinct structure area
sometimes optic disk often vessel
bring structure sharp focus rotating changing lens wheel needed
zero reading often works well
myopic examiners need negative red number unless patient refractive error balances examiner
aphakic patients require high positive often contrast patient intraocular lens implant cataract surgery special need
move along vessel direction leading larger caliber e toward junctures vessels
soon reach optic disk
study color lateral margins size optic cup disk elevation pattern vessels emerging
record details drawing wish discuss abnormalities follow time enhance funduscopic technique
try appreciate pulsations retinal veins overlying disk
easiest see artery bend vein causes apparent diagonal interruption one edge contained venous blood column
next move along superior temporal artery observing normally slowly diminishing caliber crossovers veins focal change color caliber content abnormalities background retina come view fields
move far peripherally possible directing light direction
crane head neck opposite direction sometimes feel though twist right table cm
patient slowly steadily move fixation point direction want go bring peripheral retina view rapid jerky movement either patient examiner take pupil light path instrument
recall asking patient assistance patient left right opposite
return disk way vein making parallel observations disk reached
procedure repeated three quadrants end one studies areas background retina visualized earlier
finally beam directed temporally patient asked look light
unless pupil pharmacologically dilated best fleeting glimpse macula may obtained pupilloconstriction involuntary movement takes view
let interesting finding distract fixed routine
study entity proceed
spot sequence first focus retina leave alone proper time
examiners sometimes fear lose lesion never find never happens one relaxed systematic dogged
use inconsistent method risks lost information
ophthalmoscope switched hand eye move symmetric point temporal patient eye repeat procedure
put lights back moment done
open shades curtains light morale
parts history taking physical examination proceed better plentiful ambient light
many doctors consider funduscopy difficult procedure routine examination
requires practice persistence need ordeal
best results achieved regularly stack deck favor avoid great hindrances patient discomfort whether physical psychic uncomfortable examiner struggle physiology
examination requires cooperation
fortunately effectiveness humanity coincide
assure patient comfortably seated eyes level
stance neither stooped twisted tiptoes
patient short prop telephone book cushion tall lower bed examining table immobile patient hunch forward lower torso head figure
enough direct ambulatory patient low chair stool
using stepstool wastes time since examiner needs move switch eyes patient
supine patients lead examiner torsion
patient paralyzed flat passively flex waist possible raising head bed near degrees possible
supine examination mandatory one must keep head shock hips extended fresh iliac venous thrombosis
patients experience anxiety alleviate informing patient dim room shine light eye
explanation usually creates complications avoids
tearful patients dilated
wash agent
barring emergency postponement funduscopy wisest
applies examiner fatigued visualization seems unsatisfactory focusing impossible genuine pathology may responsible failure often view found crystal clear night sleep
ambient light causes pupilloconstriction lower shades close curtains turn room light leave shade cracked small lamp night light x ray viewbox illumination
otherwise patient may frightened may waste time inching hunting stumbling dark
employ lowest rheostat setting instrument shows detail color satisfaction
two thirds maximum often serves well
delay study macula light sensitive area last
accommodation response causes pupilloconstriction patient fixate point less away counteract relative pupillodilation low lighting
one looks retina hole iris four normally clear optic structures aggregately called mediacornea aqueous lens vitreous
total inability visualize retina usually means intervening opacity commonly cataract vitreous hemorrhage
retina persistently looks wavy hazy focus significance
examiner aggravation turning light maximum rectify problem
instead begin examination dwelling media detail localize trouble spot
done already consider pharmacologic dilation often permits visualization via nearby parallel light path obstructed opacity example one often circumvent cataract see retina pupil large enough
nonsensical posture become entrenched quarters whereby examiner see everything tiny miotic pupil considered unsuccessful
foolish expectation never encountered among true experts ophthalmologists refuse render opinions unless see fundus adequately usually means pharmacologically dilated pupil figure
much gibberish clouded use innocuous aid
reader consult nover phillips sapira schneiderman references information seek faculty supervision first hundred uses mydriatic pupillodilating drops
brief patient informed procedure including need avoid driving home
agrees dilation examiner ascertains low risk precipitating acute narrow angle glaucoma history lack shadowing nasal half iris light shined temporal side plane iris
baseline pupil sizes reactions recorded
thereafter one drop tropicamide instilled sterilely conjunctival sac
patient keeps eyes closed minutes prolong contact agent conjunctiva
minutes pupils large nonreactive
interim inspection shows scant effect extra drug seldom needed time
lights kept low patient comfort since photophobia normal pupillodilation obvious reasons
funduscopy proceeds ordinary fashion infinitely greater ease speed completeness accuracy
conclusion patient reminded report promptly eye pain unusual headache day failure begin regaining comfort accommodation ability read focus television someone face within hours
may mean ocular pressure rising e glaucoma unmasked extreme rarity one great import
symptom requires immediate evaluation unless physician certain nonglaucomatous cause immediate ophthalmologic consultation would requisite
outpatients glaucomatous symptoms precaution drive hours mydriasis paralyzed accommodation create road hazard even strong sunglasses even night friend relative public transportation means must bring home
inpatients one notifies covering staff enters full procedure note avoiding staff panic mr
jones found talking pleasantly fixed dilated
patient comatose need see eyegrounds outweighs continuous preservation pupillary markers neurologic status one affix surgical tape forehead one written done including time pharmacologic intervention
elementary simply commonsensical procedures may sound many resident attending physicians omit omit pupillodilation either ignorance false belief consume much time
fact save time effort facilitating examination permitting better diagnosis accurate findings
meticulous adherence procedures investment effort yields rich returns
retina disappears mid examination look eye sure illuminating pupil figure reposition light confuse patient apologizing
dead batteries another common cause failure usually heralded brownout
patients unable cooperate render funduscopy difficult
intriguing proximity examiner face light creates curiosity endures even fears gone
patient fixes gaze examiner light resulting moving target illuminated retina accommodation occurs shrinking target
assistant wiggling finger single spot meter away patient interesting picture mark wall keep many eyes still
subject may wander especially pain apprehension distracts
fixation device helps
mirror simplest device
patient encouraged stare mirror figure c
lacking mirror one may assistant relative aide wave speak continuously even sing speaking helpful enough
pediatricians project moving picture cartoons onto spot desired fixation excellent results
eye reflects blinding white light back see structures change angle approach ever slightly
usually cut responsible corneal glare
smaller beam lower rheostat setting also help
one detail gross anatomy may confuse observer small vessel looping temporal disk margin independent rest
cilioretinal artery common normal variant harbinger new vessel formation attendant risk hemorrhage
histologic correlations autopsy animal studies provided enormous insights ophthalmoscopic findings
whet reader palate
retinal edema first causes local elevation grayish loss transparency
chronic edema results lipoprotein deposition producing characteristic sharp edged discoloration variety shades yellow
appearance sometimes called hard waxy exudate based well defined lateral borders flat anteroposterior character term misleads since transudates may create picture
serves better consider focus chronic edema
bear mind full starling equation describing forces leading extravasation fluid including vascular permeability factor
every cause hard exudates includes abnormal factors equation
mind one subgroup class cause e g
increased permeability increased venous plasma hydrostatic pressure etc rather memorize lists
inflammation increases permeability retinitis
venous therefore capillary pressure rises central retinal vein occlusion papilledema
loss pericytes allows leakage diabetic vasculopathy
physical damage high pressures may act directly may also induce arteriolitis systemic hypertension creating twofold abnormality
contrast called soft exudates also known cottonwool spots gray white gray yellow show indistinct margins
histologically represent infarction ischemic necrosis nerve fiber layer referred infarcts
one predict occurrence diverse vasculopathies including vasculitides
one infer several entities produce types lesions
however one wonders cotton wool spots commonly complicate aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome absence retinal infection
histologic configuration determines distinctive shapes hemorrhages various retinal layers
example splinter shaped hemorrhages must reflect extravasation inner nerve fiber layer
blood follow path least resistance fibers across
inner nerve fiber layer fibers long axes perpendicular examiner light
thus leading edge hemorrhage feathery
sapira highly readable work summarizes features hemorrhage layer includes principal etiologies import
funduscopy provides means direct inspection arteries veins central nervous system intact living patient
list conditions changes patient management outcome would woefully incomplete
selections cited
finding papilledema swollen optic nerve head usually reflecting elevated intracranial pressure medical emergency
treatment cause prevent irreversible neuronal damage somatic death
absence papilledema mean well since development occur immediately intracranial pressure rises
however visible retinal venous pulsations exclude increased intracranial pressure vital datum assessing patient headaches evolving neurologic status head trauma
loss reappearance pulsation rapidly reflect intracranial pressure changes
importantly absent pulsations necessarily mean elevated intracranial pressure
retinal hemorrhages occur diverse conditions including endocarditis pernicious anemia diabetes mellitus leukemia subarachnoid hemorrhage disseminated intra vascular coagulation dig
always deserve note diagnosis management appearance may lead initial diagnosis assessment progression
severe hypertension finding retinal hemorrhage redefines entity accelerated hypertension given blood pressure reading
grim prognosis entity uncontrolled constitutes emergency blood pressure control needed weeks day
often means treatment intensive care unit
prevention early death preservation renal function feasibility subsequent outpatient maintenance reward examiner prowess
chorioretinal lesions certain infections virtually diagnostic
candidal exudates mean endophthalmitis patient suspected systemic candidosis
cytomegalovirus patient aids highly characteristic appearance consists mixed hemorrhages yellow granular exudates frequently centered vessels
vivid offensive aide memoire appearance crumbled cheese ketchup
toxoplasmosis histoplasmosis eye also distinct although pathognomonic looks physical examination funduscopy
miliary tuberculosis may confirmed spotting choroidal tubercles
apparent complete obliteration venous blood columns cross arteries occurs two disk diameters away disk called complete av arterio venous crossing change
phenomenon seen vascular disease considerable chronicity impact
lesion provides permanent marker even motension restored
consider normotensive man heart failure left ventricular hypertrophy dilatation prior medical contact
lacking features ischemic valvular cause cardiologists speculate chronic hypertensive damage responsible cardiac dysfunction vascular reflexes normalized blood pressure
entire scenario common practice
av crossing changes seen hypothesis confirmed
none found primary heart muscle disorder dilated cardiomyopathy becomes likely etiology
proliferative diabetic retinopathy leading cause blindness contained laser photocoagulation
ophthalmoscopic recognition pre proliferative lesions frank neovascularization lead measures prevent occurrence typical sequelae retinal vitreous hemorrhage permanent blindness
diabetic nephropathy rarely occurs without diabetic retinopathy normal retina nephrotic diabetic stimulate search nondiabetic causes renal disease thus refining selective efficient use diagnostic resources
cerebrovascular disease ophthalmoscopic finding provides data essential management
examiner sees fragments atheroma impacted retinal arterioles knows originate situ caliber vessel experience atherogenesis
therefore embolized ulcerated plaque proximal locale aortic arch carotid artery
fragments yellow refractile typically occlude arteriolar branch called hollenhontplaques
hazard embolization brain strengthen case carotid arterial surgery
cerebrovascular tests measure brain texture blood flow pressure may remain normal ulcerated plaque occurs without critical arterial stenosis carotid arteriography exception danger discomfort expense relegate highly selected cases need use funduscopy screening underscored
tortuous sausage link like retinal veins patient macroglobulinemia imply marked hyperviscosity heighten antithrombotic efforts
discovery retinoblastoma childhood malignancy sometimes familial lead lifesaving therapy prevention patient perhaps family members well
surveillance remaining eye post enucleation may uncover second primary afflicts many victims found early enough conservative therapy may preserve vision well life
