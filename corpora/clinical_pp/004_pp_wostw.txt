diagnosis uncertain art
mean physicians hesitant equivocating short autopsy room rarely absolutely certain diagnosis
particularly true early phases diagnostic evaluations
studies physician reasoning demonstrated physicians evaluate patients keep limited set five seven diagnostic hypotheses mind assigned relative probability likely possible unlikely
relative probabilities likelihoods adjusted upward downward depending new information gained history physical examination diagnostic tests
enough information one diagnostic possibility becomes likely enough physician stop investigations declare possibility diagnosis
example process imagine asked evaluate patient hypertension
even see patient several diagnostic possibilities come mind essential hypertension renovascular disease primary hyperaldosteronism pheochromocytoma coarctation aorta chronic renal disease name
based large referred series hypertensive patients prior information fact patient hypertensive speculate likelihood essential hypertension cumulative likelihood secondary forms majority accounted renovascular disease
initial probabilities might thus stated essential hypertension likely renovascular possible others less unlikely
imagine walk examining room see patient year old white female
based high proportion patients renovascular disease information alone causes revise probabilities
revised probability renovascular disease would increase essential hypertension others would decrease
adjusted revised set probabilities might look like essential hypertension likely renovascular disease likely others less extremely unlikely
physical examination hear flank bruit would increasingly certain renovascular disease raising probability lowering possibilities
diagnostic process would proceed intravenous pyelogram radionuclide flow scan arteriography probability revisions occurring step
important point whether done explicitly implicitly physicians approach diagnosis using process successively revising probabilities
several problems however
evidence also exists physicians gain maximum benefit information available history physical diagnostic tests always revise diagnostic probabilities degree warranted data
compared formal mathematical models probability revision physicians fail properly adjust disease likelihoods either overestimating diagnostic value laboratory tests
physicians tend treat diagnostic tests perfect information failing recognize laboratory data probabilistic
human failings face uncertainty lead misuses diagnostic information described earlier
much chapter one follows devoted implications probabilistic nature diagnosis interpretation laboratory tests
formal rules diagnostic test interpretation set forth
several characteristics tests crucial interpretation
two operating characteristics enable judge test per se reliability accuracy
characteristics enable judge test respect results affect diagnostic probabilities sensitivity specificity predictive value positive negative
reliability precision test measure reproducibility obtained running test many times specimen
unreliable test one yields results vary widely due chance technical error
tests therefore difficult interpret day day variation given test may due something true change patient condition
changes reliable test contrast likely reflect true patient change
test accuracy reflects degree test result reflects true value
imagine investigating new cheaper way measuring hematocrit
assume true hematocrit obtained hand centrifugation new test accurate closely matches centrifuged results
test inaccurate systematically vary true value
important realize test reliability accuracy may vary independently one another
test may inaccurate totally reliable
would case newly developed hematocrit example always exactly five percentage points higher centrifuged hematocrit
case new hematocrit would reliable always value inaccurate always different true value
different relationships reliability accuracy shown figure
sensitivity test refers proportion patients given disease positive test
specificity test refers proportion patients without disease negative test
example consider obtaining antinuclear antibodies ana large number patients systemic lupus erythematosus sle
patient may either positive ana referred true positive negative ana referred false negative
sensitivity would proportion sle patients positive anas
similarly proportion set patients without sle negative anas called true negatives would called specificity ana
non sle patients positive anas would called false positives
predictive value hand refers likelihood patient disease given positive negative test result
referring sleana example took large number people positive anas independently without using ana results determined truly sle proportion ana positive patients sle would represent positive predictive value ana
conversely proportion negative ana patients sle would represent negative predictive value
relationships sensitivity specificity positive negative predictive values demonstrated figure
concepts dealt greater depth following chapter important note positive negative predictive values test depend sensitivity specificity also likelihood disease test done referred prior probability prior likelihood prevalence disease
means sensitivity specificity tests vary patient patient positive negative predictive values vary patients different prior likelihoods disease
importance prior likelihood interpreting test result overemphasized
particular low prior likelihood frequently results low positive predictive value even relatively specific test
take instance disease low prior probability say
test disease sensitivity specificity predictive value positive test
little calculation reveals positive predictive value test patient prior likelihood
still chance patient free disease even though test positive
contrast prior likelihood positive predictive value test
low prior likelihoods usually result low positive predictive values
calculations surprised understand physicians always well asked intuitively revise probabilities
reason every physician able perform simple probability calculations bedside
understanding operating characteristics enable carry probability revisions necessary diagnostic process
first prior likelihood determined history physical examination
diagnostic test obtained using sensitivity specificity prior likelihood positive negative predictive value test calculated
predictive value becomes revised probability disease
calculations performed hand held calculator using effort takes calculate antibiotic doses creatinine clearances
following chapter deals specifically actual process calculating predictive values
purposes tests obtained great deal choice diagnostic test interpretation
one survey physicians large teaching hospital found three general reasons accounted laboratory test ordering diagnosis monitoring therapy screening asymptomatic disease
order use test diagnostic purposes test positive large proportion patients disease high sensitivity negative large proportion without disease high specificity
ideally test maximally useful diagnostic use sensitivity specificity
would mean every patient disease would positive test false negatives result negative predictive value
similarly positive tests would occur patients disease false positives resulting positive predictive value
unfortunately tests high sensitivity specificity predictive value unheard
fact tests high sensitivity tend low specificity vice versa
little thought however allow choose proper lest particular diagnostic purpose
one might say two basic diagnostic uses laboratory tests
first wish rule disease absolutely second wish confirm
examining purposes closely allows identify test characteristics necessary use
order absolutely sure patient disease ruling falsely negative tests minimized test high sensitivity used
highly sensitive test negative result produces high negative predictive value essence meaning vast majority patients negative result disease
conversely order confident individual disease confirming false positive tests minimized necessitating specific test
test individual positive result likely disease high positive predictive value
general wish rule particular diagnosis choose test high sensitivity wish confirm diagnosis choose test high specificity
particular diagnostic purpose choose test determine important operating characteristic sensitivity specificity
obvious tradeoffs however
since sensitivity specificity tend inversely related test chosen ruling disease particularly valuable confirming unexpectedly positive
similarly negative test chosen confirm disease less helpful ruling
example consider disease exists two tests test sensitive poorly specific test b specific poorly sensitive
furthermore assume likelihood disease roughly chance patient disease
table
presents revised probabilities disease given results test
see test used possible rule disease possible confirm
test positive likelihood disease still whereas negative likelihood drops way
conversely test b used may possible confirm diagnosis possible rule disease
test positive likelihood disease greater negative disease likelihood remains high
remember confirm disease choose test high specificity rule disease choose test high sensitivity
examples use diagnostic tests abound
whenever test repeated order follow therapeutic drug level observe side effects used monitoring purposes
following serum potassium patients using diuretics creatinine use nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents aminoglycosides hematocrit patients acute gi bleeding monitoring uses
monitoring therapeutic drug levels yet another instance
purpose sensitivity specificity predictive value less relevance reliability accuracy
monitoring serum value ordinarily means measuring repeatedly
purpose reliability critical
serum potassium suddenly drops
mmoll vitally important confident represents true change potassium value simply technical error random variation
highly reliable accurate test needed
little good know potassium level
mmoll particular test using inaccurate
situation true potassium might low
high
purposes monitoring salient operating characteristics reliability accuracy
object use diagnostic tests screening detect disease earliest presymptomatic state presumably less widespread easily treated cured
screening programs stool occult blood screening mammography aimed cancer detection although screening programs exist disorders glaucoma hypertension diabetes
many criteria successful screening programs focus operating characteristics necessary produce good screening test
ideal screening test would share many characteristics ideal diagnostic test general
sensitivity specificity predictive values close
mentioned tests exist
ordinarily faced choice tests high sensitivity high specificity
implications choice screening test desired
initial tendency would use sensitive test
test false negatives high negative predictive value meaning individuals disease would missed
tradeoff unfortunately type test high sensitivity low specificity poor positive predictive value meaning positive individuals would falsely positive
test used screening large populations significant number individuals positive tests small number truly diseased
remember individuals screening populations definition relatively low prior likelihoods disease
low likelihood populations predictive value positive tests low
case stool occult blood screening tested individuals positive positive individuals colon cancer
positive predictive value many individuals subjected costly uncomfortable potentially dangerous procedures order detect colon cancer
using highly specific test drawbacks
highly specific tests higher positive predictive values lower negative predictive values
higher proportion patients positive tests actually cancer fewer individuals cancer detected
absence relatively inexpensive test highly sensitive highly specific choice sensitive test results high proportion unnecessary diagnostic evaluations specific test results sizeable proportion diseased individuals going undetected
unfortunately general rule depend
choice depend whether patients benefit early disease detection well relative costs risks subsequent diagnostic evaluation
table
summarizes general guidelines use choosing diagnostic tests one three specific purposes
remember important specific purpose mind choosing test tests operating characteristics required satisfy every purpose
laboratories define normal values provide results
commonly set normal values obtained determining test results large number presumably healthy volunteers plotting frequency distribution results
normal range determined calculating mean standard deviation distribution declaring normal value falling within two standard deviations mean fig
definition statistically range encompasses roughly normal individuals
normals defined way normal individuals paradoxically declared abnormal
important point remember faced unexpectedly abnormal test result patient
fact normal person given test chance declared abnormal important implications especially one recalls diagnostic tests often obtained groups batteries even
large diagnostic batteries overall likelihood one test abnormal rises number tests battery rises
look table
demonstrates
likelihood one test test battery abnormal
means roughly healthy patients abnormal test result
percentage chance abnormals even impressive number tests rises
test chemistry screen
likelihood set completely normal results
important consider possibility chance deviations deciding whether investigate unexpectedly abnormal test results large test batteries
investigations may account large proportion unnecessary costs risks incurred inappropriate laboratory testing
course causes unexpected abnormals chance presence unsuspected disease
certain subsets individuals differ systematically normal range general population
young elderly instance particular normal ranges many diagnostic tests
usual normal ranges applied significant proportions individuals may declared abnormal
may also true persons different sex persons varying racial backgrounds
one faced unexpectedly abnormal result
suggestion reconsider reexamine patient
taking focused detailed history well repeating certain portions physical examination may uncover information light unexpected result may increase suspicion underlying disease
process uncover new information perhaps unexpected result may reflect true abnormality patient
however perhaps best strategy cautiously observe patient time repeating pertinent history physical well single abnormal test result
patient develops symptoms signs test result becomes progressively abnormal investigation warranted
difficult course recommend specific action every unexpected abnormal result
instead intent create awareness many perhaps majority test results due factor underlying disease
best course action may often cautious wait see opposed blindly pursuing every abnormal value costly often frustrating end point
normal test result hand may provide information think
may fact affect diagnostic probabilities much abnormal test result
example imagine patient considering two disease possibilities b
disease erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr almost always elevated time whereas disease b uncommonly elevated time
normal esr affect diagnostic likelihoods original probabilities diseases b
look table
demonstrates normal result marked effect diagnostic probabilities
revised probabilities show disease b given normal esr almost four times likely disease
normal results markedly alter diagnostic probabilities
even normal individuals range test results distributed
also true abnormal individuals unfortunately case ranges overlap
situation understood becomes apparent sensitivity specificity many tests simultaneously maximized
figure
demonstrates
figure overlapping ranges normal abnormal individuals given lab test displayed
define cutoff point value test result said abnormal certain percentage normal individuals declared abnormal false positives certain percentage abnormal individuals declared normal false negatives
would happen attempt made improve sensitivity test changing cutoff point
could done moving cutoff point right figure b decreasing numbers false negatives increasing sensitivity
unfortunately moving cutoff point right number false positives would increase decreasing specificity
long distributions normal abnormal overlap way increase sensitivity without decreasing specificity
reverse also true
figure c represents attempt increase specificity moving cutoff point left order decrease false positives
results decreasing sensitivity simultaneously increasing number false negatives
sadly true long normal abnormal distributions overlap attempt improve sensitivity specificity changing cutoff point result lowering characteristic
case laboratory tests
however brighter side
recall required operating characteristics differ different purposes
rule tests require high sensitivity whereas confirmation tests require high specificity
one therefore might imagine changing cutoff point order make test suitable particular purpose
test used rule purposes cutoff point could moved right order increase sensitivity used confirmatory purposes cutoff point could moved left increase specificity
test made suitable either purpose simply adjusting cutoff point
summary lot normal test result first meets eye
unexpectedly abnormal results viewed suspicion especially encountered large test batteries obtained apparently healthy individuals low likelihoods underlying disease
normal test results hand frequently allow revisions diagnostic probabilities
finally normal abnormal cutoff point given test may altered order make test suitable specific purposes
exceptions albeit rarely
normal ranges hemoglobin hematocrit different men women
addition many tests different normal ranges pediatric adult age groups
term adult however compromises large age range normal lab values vary considerably
recall sensitivity equals
number false negatives decreases sensitivity increases
similarly specificity equals
false positives increase specificity decreases
reverse also true increasing false negatives decreases sensitivity decreasing false positives increases specificity
several diagnostic test ordering strategies routinely used physicians discussed section
shown inefficient costly
since advent multichannel chemistry laboratory equipment become fashionable routinely order laboratory tests every patient admitted hospital
tests usually include complete blood count coagulation profile urinalysis serum electrolytes combination serum chemistries electrocardiogram chest x ray
tests ordered routinely without regard actual admitting diagnosis underlying probabilities
two reasons usually cited justify process tests helpful screening asymptomatic disease useful defining database baseline set data light future changes evaluated
routine screening admission tests looked critically several investigators
general described problem number routine tests increases likelihood unexpectedly abnormal test rises dramatically
addition anxiety aroused physician patient abnormal tests result expense repeated investigated using costly invasive confirmatory tests
furthermore abnormal results even persistent sometimes little impact patient care
one study found abnormal screening tests often ignored physicians pursued lead infrequently positive diagnosis
another study investigated patients unexpectedly abnormal screening tests finding cases abnormalities lead diagnosis presymptomatic disease
cases abnormalities could predicted retrospect careful consideration clinical status patient tests normal repeated testing
durbridge evaluated benefits routine screening admission testing patients comparing two similarly sized groups screening tests either obtained obtained withheld attending physicians unless requested deemed necessary independent advisory committee
benefit found spite increase total laboratory costs increase total hospital bill
recently hubbell looked impact routine chest x rays patient care finding results affected treatment time spite fact x rays obtained population patients high prevalence cardiopulmonary disease
studies routine testing therefore found strategy rarely leads new diagnoses dramatic changes patient care spite increased cost
important note however carefully defined routine test obtained patients little evidence suspect underlying disease e patients prior likelihood disease low symptoms signs suggest disease
patients one would expect predictive value positive test low leading findings studies cited
specific admission testing done patients cause believe prior likelihood disease higher examples serum potassium magnesium patients diuretics chest x rays patients uncontrolled malignancies electrocardiograms patients chest pain
tests obtained patients obtained routine screening purposes instead obtained monitoring therapy diagnostic purposes population patients high likelihood disease
database concept closely linked routine screening
many hospitals especially associated training programs defined database consisting battery diagnostic tests obtained every patient admitted
database intended screen disease strategy subject criticisms discussed
many physicians however use database baseline possible changes resulting known disease andor therapy compared
examples include measuring renal function patients undergo therapy nephrotoxic antibiotics cytotoxic agents measuring serum electrolytes patients placed diuretics obtaining electrocardiogram patients high risk subsequent development ischemic heart disease
many cases database serves valuable purpose
note however database routine
used specifically patients groups patients likelihood present future abnormalities higher usual patient specific instance monitoring
decide use database remember several points
first full database repeated every time patient admitted
unless events occurred since last admission give reason believe certain database values changed originally obtained values may suffice
second database obtained every patient especially ambulatory patients
healthy year old man presents inguinal hernia require database year old man presents severe pneumonia simply differ likelihoods underlying disease expected monitoring needs
decision obtain repeat database therefore one individualized respect patient happens patient time
summarize routine admission repeated database testing confirmed high hopes began advocating use several decades ago multichannel testing equipment developed
admission database testing never routine instead tailored differing needs individual selected groups patients time
strategy consists ordering one two laboratory tests order rule every disease long list diagnostic possibilities
often practiced physicians faced complex diagnostic problems broad differential diagnoses fever unknown origin rule testing falls prey many probabilistic pitfalls
major problem rule strategies ignore prior probabilities
test ordered investigate every disease possibility regardless likely unlikely possibility
relatively large number tests ordered using strategy likelihood one tests abnormal chance rather high
addition given poor specificity many lab tests positive predictive value one abnormal test low especially prior likelihood disease question low begin
rule testing utilized fashion often leads rather less diagnostic uncertainty
better strategy might developed formulating differential diagnosis based preliminary assessment patient ordering laboratory tests diseases deemed likely
choosing tests likely subset possibilities diagnosis may confirmed without unnecessary expense confusion involved investigating entire list
testing possibilities ruled revised probabilities subset drops second subset rise
second stage investigation involves ordering laboratory diagnostic tests evaluate second list
none possibilities confirmed progress third subset
strategy might called ordered subset strategy
evaluating successive subsets originally lengthy differential diagnosis avoids pitfalls multiple testing poor predictive value involved less efficient costly rule strategy
considerations probability may enter
perhaps relevant need diagnose certain diseases early course consequences even short delays life threatening
possibility disease may prompt diagnostic testing even likelihood fairly low
two tests varying sensitivity specificity available many diseases
choice test either highly specific highly sensitive depends whether one wants confirm rule disease
use tests together
strategy termed combination parallel testing
imagine disease prior likelihood
two tests b differing sensitivity specificity
test sensitive lower specificity test b poorly sensitive highly specific
decide use tests
furthermore decide diagnose disease either test test b positive
table
shows sensitivity specificity parallel combination tests
used fashion sensitivity combination higher either test alone specificity much lower
using tests combinations generally results increased sensitivity lower specificity
negative predictive value combinations therefore generally high positive predictive value low compared one single test
whether select strategy determined purpose
wish rule disease parallel combinations may useful high negative predictive values
purpose confirm disease low positive predictive value parallel combinations may unsuitable
combination testing common clinical medicine examples including liver function tests scot total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase albumin rule myocardial infarction cpk sgot ldh batteries
whatever purpose remember combinations always expensive single tests
decision use combination therefore affected probability considerations costs well
analysis based assumption conditional independence
basically assumption dictates sensitivity specificity given test independent results tests
assumption may always justified
two situations lab test repeated test result unexpectedly abnormal multiple tests routinely ordered serial stool occult blood examinations serial blood cultures
respects strategy analogous combination testing except multiple repetitions test used rather combinations different tests
using strategy clinician faced choice two rules believe positive believe negative
first rule positive test repeated set used confirm diagnosis whereas second rule negative set used rule diagnosis
rules illustrated table
tests repeated twice
deciding rule use may considerably difficult seems
general believe positive rule tend increase sensitivity expense specificity since multiple repetitions false positive results carry weight false negative results
similarly believe negative rule tends increase specificity expense sensitivity
often reilex act simply repeating abnormal test may simple would like believe
politser discusses issue detail quite complex
one considers test reliability diseased nondiseased populations rules may either increase decrease sensitivity specificity
much costly misuse misinterpretation diagnostic tests due fact physicians always able manage intuitively probabilistic information laboratory tests provide
diagnostic process one successive probability revision
knowledge operating characteristics laboratory tests e sensitivity specificity predictive value greatly facilitate process
knowledgeable use operating characteristics allows test choices tailored specific purposes diagnosis monitoring screening
addition use allows proper interpretation normal test results well discriminate use common strategies screening rule testing repeating tests combination testing
