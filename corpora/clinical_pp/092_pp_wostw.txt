history past gastrointestinal diseases encompasses disorders esophagus stomach pancreas gall bladder biliary tract well jaundice
among esophageal diseases gastroesophageal reflux disease consists reflux gastric contents incompetent lower esophageal sphincter causing symptoms
may associated esophageal inflammation minority patients bleeding stricture formation
esophageal stricture fibrotic narrowing generally lower end consequence injury usually reflux esophagitis
tumors esophagus extrinsic intrinsic produce narrowing esophageal lumen leading symptoms closely mimic benign stricture
motor disorders esophagus group disorders characterized motor dysfunction primary esophageal diseases achalasia diffuse spasm presbyesophagus others reflect esophageal manifestations secondary diseases
peptic ulcer sharply demarcated denuded area involving mucosa submucosa muscularis mucosa
occurs commonly stomach duodenum
pain characteristic symptom
pancreatitis inflammation pancreas classified acute acute recurrent relapsing chronic relapsing chronic exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
common disease gallbladder associated presence gallstones subsequent inflammation cholecystitis
cholecystitis acute chronic
stones common bile duct choledocholithisis hepatic ducts may produce jaundice andor biliary sepsis cholangitis
jaundice icterus yellow discoloration skin sclera mucous membranes caused deposition bilirubin
clinically apparent serum bilirubin range mgdl
results abnormalities bilirubin metabolism
depending site interference hyperbilirubinemia unconjugated indirect conjugated direct combined
gastroesophageal reflux disease common
reflux acid peptic alkaline gastric contents lower esophagus results stimulation mucosal submucosal pain receptors produce symptom heartburn pyrosis retrosternal burning sensation
heartburn esophageal pain may localized retrosternal region multiple areas throat root neck angle jaws right left anterior chest epigastrium right hypochondrium sometimes even umbilical region
gastroesophageal reflux chronic condition characterized fluctuation symptomatology
pain differs duodenal ulcer pain persistent relieved briefly oral antacids
well defined acid cycle occurs duodenal ulcer seen condition
factors reduce competence lower esophageal sphincter fatty meal citrus juices tomato juice mint chocolate high dose ethanol cigarette smoking certain body positions decubitus sitting certain subjects may aggravate heartburn
factors increase intra abdominal pressure pregnancy bending anything impedes normal drainage gastric contents gastric outlet obstruction may make symptoms worse
chronic reflux may result formation stricture lower end esophagus
occurs original symptoms may change predominant dysphagia
therefore important inquire dysphagia patients take dietary history
dysphagia difficulty swallowing classic symptom presence esophageal stricture
gastroesophageal reflux common cause development stricture one inquire presence symptoms reflux past namely chronic recurrent heartburn
often patient symptoms heartburn decrease frequency intensity stricture develops
stricture esophagus also occur consequence gastroesophageal surgery inlying nasogastric tube prolonged vomiting corrosive ingestion
detailed inquiry made risk factors past
tumors esophagus cause similar symptoms since squamous cell carcinoma common tumor one inquire presence predisposing factors patient tylosis corrosive ingestion peptic esophagitis achalasia alcoholism cigarette smoking plummer vinson syndrome past head neck cancer
dysphagia difficulty swallowing common symptom patients motor disorders esophagus
produced transport problems involving body esophagus related diminished absent disordered peristalsis well lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction especially inadequate relaxation
chest pain typical heartburn caused esophageal distention spasm occurs disease particularly diffuse esophageal spasm
odynophagia painful swallowing may occur result swallowing initiated esophageal spasm
unlike organic diseases symptoms associated motor disorders present long time generally months years
also generally characterized fluctuation intermittency aggravation emotional stress
weight loss may absent
patients inquiry made previous esophageal cardiac work well surgical manipulations bougienage dilations even anti reflux gastric surgery
duodenal ulcer classically patient complains localized epigastric pain occurs stomach empty relieved food antacids vomiting
pain may awaken patient night approximately
usually present morning awakening
characteristic feature duodenal ulcer pain intermittence
pain constant unchanging possibility alternative diagnosis complication duodenal ulcer penetration pancreas obstruction considered
vomiting somewhat unusual important symptom uncomplicated duodenal ulcer
mild diarrhea may occur
pain gastric ulcer similar duodenal ulcer two may indistinguishable
sometimes gastric ulcer pain may occur short time eating even eating
cyclical pattern duodenal ulcer pain may lacking
location pain may left epigastrium
vomiting may present
weight loss common duodenal ulcer
peptic ulcer disease recurring condition inquiring past episodes important
pattern exacerbations remissions months called periodicity
often patient know site previous ulcer duodenal gastric
possible patients ulcer disease atypical upper abdominal symptoms
situation careful inquiry made past ulcer disease complications
symptoms elicited suggestive ulcer disease examiner must ascertain whether patient complications disease
hemorrhage occurs patients ulcer
inquiry made past episodes black tarry stools occult blood stool anemia vomiting coffee ground material bright red blood shock blood transfusions
perforations occur
dramatic event patient remember probability undergone surgery
penetration characterized intractable pain radiating back mimicking pancreatic pain
rhythmicity classic duodenal ulcer pain lost
vomiting signs pancreatitis fever leukocytosis may present may present
obstruction occurs approximately
also pain may become constant may relieved vomiting
weight loss anorexia early satiety may present
patients ulcer symptoms might undergone surgery past
incidence recurrent ulcer surgery varies
type surgery undergone ascertained whether gastric resection without vagotomy type anastomosis
acute pancreatitis causes symptom complex abdominal pain fever nausea vomiting
might vary mild vague abdominal pain established shock acute abdomen
pain important feature
usually starts acutely epigastrium may bore back
sitting leaning forward may give relief
progressively pain may involve whole abdomen may indistinguishable conditions causing acute abdomen
nausea vomiting occur frequently association pain
unlike classic gastric disorders vomiting may relieve pain
fever another common finding
probably results tissue damage necessarily indicate infection
however infections particularly biliary tract excluded
shock occurs attack severe
fluid sequestration retroperitoneum intestines blood loss release injury related kinins may cause
united states alcohol major cause acute pancreatitis
thus important take detailed history alcohol consumption include amount duration
takes generally years steady heavy alcohol consumption person develops pancreatitis even though pancreas might already sustained subclinical damage
biliary tract disease namely choledocholithiasis established cause acute pancreatitis
proposed mechanisms include stone impaction stenosis sphincter oddi
thus patient usually middle aged woman
examiner inquire past biliary gallbladder disease biliary gallbladder surgery family history gallbladder lithiasis hemolytic disease
hypercalcemia particularly associated hyperparathyroidism known associated acute pancreatitis
proposed pathogenetic mechanisms include intraductal lithiasis activation trypsin increased concentration calcium pancreatic juice pancreatic vasculitis
inquiry made symptoms hypercalcemia renal lithiasis past diagnosis parathyroid disease patient immediate family
relationship hyperlipidemia acute pancreatitis clear one
pancreatic lipase thought convert intrapancreatic triglycerides toxic free fatty acids cause inflammation pancreas
lipoprotein abnormalities associated pancreatitis type increased chylomicrons type iv increased low density lipoproteins vldl type v increased chylomicrons increased vldl
examiner inquire presence family history hyperlipidemia young patients acute pancreatitis
besides alcohol drugs clearly associated pancreatitis include azathioprine estrogens furosemide sulfonamides thiazide diuretics
number drugs probably cause pancreatitis
careful drug history important patient acute pancreatitis
patient presenting history recurrent episodes pancreatic disease might aware diagnosis
case direct questioning reveal great deal valuable information
following questions may asked disease pancreas
physician call acute pancreatitis chronic pancreatitis
thought causing
work done x rays ultrasound examination ct scan
treated
physician advice discharge
complications pancreatitis
surgical intervention contemplated done
records obtained
chronic pancreatitis chronic relapsing pancreatitis commonly caused alcohol
hyperparathyroidism hyperlipidemia malnutrition hereditary causes may also cause chronic pancreatitis
less common etiologies include hemochromatosis cystic fibrosis collagen vascular diseases idiopathic causes
chronic chronic recurrent abdominal pain common symptom
mal absorption leading weight loss may occur
diabetes may develop
generally patients chronic pancreatitis chronic relapsing pancreatitis multiple hospitalizations extensive past evaluations
direct questions may asked long pain
work done previous episodes
surgery
therapy given
symptoms develop patients cholelithiasis
biliary colic cardinal symptompain usually constant rather colicky upper abdomen generally epigastrium right upper quadrant
pain may radiate right shoulder back
vomiting fever may present
another common symptom cholelithiasis flatulent dyspepsia combination upper abdominal discomfort increased eructation dyspepsia
must however emphasized flatulent dyspepsia specific symptom disease
examiner inquire presence two symptoms intermittent basis patients
sometimes patients may appear well informed
case may asked direct questions trouble gallbladder
attack gallbladder pain past
x rays ultrasound gallbladder
jaundiced yellow eyes high colored urine last attack
fever chills
admitted hospital
require strong pain medicines control pain
could reports past evaluations obtained physician hospital
choledocholithiasis may asymptomatic
often stone duct produce symptoms biliary colic described without obstructive jaundice
latter characterized light colored acholic stools dark colored urine bilirubinuria
thus important inquire stool color patients
stone partially obstructing common bile duct cause ascending infection biliary tree called cholangitis may lead septicemia biliary intrahepatic suppuration
condition characterized fever chills jaundice biliary colic
inquire patient symptoms cholangitis past may recurrent disease
another question must asked patients biliary tract symptoms whether ever biliary pancreatic surgery
postoperative biliary strictures abscesses may produce symptoms similar intrinsic biliary tract disease
finally remember acute pancreatitis may result passage biliary calculi gallstone pancreatitis past diagnosis pancreatitis may indication biliary lithiasis
careful history give examiner great deal insight cause jaundice
inquiry made presence general systemic symptoms anorexia loss impaired appetite weight loss chills fever skin lesions rashes abdominal pain arthritis arthralgias
inquiry made use counter medications laxatives sedatives
ask exposure close contact sexual jaundiced persons needle sticks parenteral drug abuse
check patient received blood transfusions blood products
occupational history e g exposure hepato toxins carbon tetrachloride looked
travel part world hepatitis endemic asia africa considered
prior history jaundice may lead possibility drug induced jaundice biliary tract disease
family history jaundice may lead consideration unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia hemolytic syndrome particularly patient anemic sickle cell disease hemoglobinopathies
patient consumes alcohol obtain quantifiable history recent prior use well history withdrawal symptoms tolerance alcohol associated illnesses erosive gastritis upper gastrointestinal bleeding pancreatitis peripheral neuropathy organic brain syndrome
recurrent episodes jaundice chronic alcoholic may due recurrent injury causing bouts alcoholic hepatitis
rarely viral hepatitis transmitted ingestion raw seafood
must remembered viral hepatitis particularly type b much common subjects multiple sexual partners homosexuals
finally recent remote past history upper abdominal pain lead examiner consider biliary pancreatic disease possible cause jaundice
