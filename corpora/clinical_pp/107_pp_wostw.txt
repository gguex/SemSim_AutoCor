hair source focused attention abnormalities quickly perceived patient
physician opportunity early detection occult systemic disease
production hair requires considerable metabolic effort
scalp alone hairs grow daily rate
mm roughly translates equivalent producing single tough protein filament approximately length
requires fine tuned nutritional vascular hormonal interactions reasonable expect variety systemic diseases produce abnormalities hair growth
additional traumas result environment variety physical chemical assaults visited hair name grooming according current dictates fashion
hair greatly resembles epidermis derived
active matrix growing cells dermo epidermal interface differentiates produce mass dead cells composed primarily tough protein keratin
place sheetlike stratum corneum protective horny layer cells packed radially longitudinal array central cortex invested circular band overlapping cells cuticle binds mass cohesive package
like good cigar wrapping must perfect contents unravel splay fragment
epidermis pigment incorporated keratinizing cells melanocytes right matrix
growing end hair deep within skin near subcutaneous fatin case scalp
mm surface
fiber though connected relatively minuscule growing portion passive dead structure simply pushed along
exchange vital juices controlling signals productive end
external fiber thus cut bleached curled straightened without peril growth even though exposed hair may obliterated
hair differs epidermis one important way
skin continuously growing replacing protective horny layer hair grows cycles
obvious anatomic differences eyebrow hair versus scalp hair example reflects varying growth rest replacement phases
tresses extending crown rump necessarily require days active growth anagen phase
scalp hairs anagen daily shed replaced called telogen phase
everyone gentle traction dislodge telogen hairs easily recognized characteristic naked white hypopigmented spheroid terminus
patients routinely consider roots reality totally keratinized portion hair pushed emerging new hair since regenerative matrix remains deep within protected sanctuary
anagen hairs must traumatically plucked skin
bring along anchoring sheaths appear gelatinous casts surrounding dark pigmented plastic cylinder living cells torn subadjacent nurturing tissue
occasionally acetabulum like depression surrounded dermal papilla remains visible
replacement telogen hairs proceeds regularly amounts daily shedding expected
although hairs may fall scalp actually net loss
patients typically seek medical care problems hair loss excessive hair growth
complaints may little physiologic effect cause considerable psychologic distress patient
far common complaints signs abnormal hair growth associated loss
alopecia means hair loss baldness
term said derived greek word fox animal commonly suffers mange causes hair loss
unwanted excess hair cosmetically distressing patient alopecia
hypertrichosis term applied excess hair growth part body hirsutism meant limited androgen induced coarse dark growth special areas beard
history include careful questioning illnesses trauma might explain complaints hair loss
seemingly ordinary practices use curling iron hair dyes bleaches damage hair shaft

common hair problems women stem damage caused styling grooming
traction pony tail fashions tight corn row braidings pressure sleeping rollers hair etc produce hair loss specific geometric patterns correspond site prolonged trauma
counterpart seen trichotillomania habitual pulling twirling hair produce less regular patterns
nervous habit uncommon children portends serious psychiatric problem adult
traction alopecias short uneven regrowing broken hairs remain help point diagnosis
chemical treatments bleaching coloring waving straightening hairs harsh prolonged frequent produce cumulative damage fibers
structural integrity destroyed hairs simply break weakest points
fragmented ends visible many pieces easily removed rubbing washing combing hair
remaining hairs usually general length quite uneven resulting ragged looking unintentional crew cut
explosive onset circles baldness hair bearing part body announces alopecia areata
process appears random unpredictable fashion may proceed loss scalp hair alopecia totalis entire body alopecia universalis
circumscribed scalp loss variety commonly seen
scalp affected sites appears remarkably normal serene effectively masking severe inflammatory process depths hair matrix
surviving hairs present invariably depigmented
reports hair turning white overnight represent selective loss pigmented hairs alopecia totalis
physiologic mechanism exists enable hair alter color suddenly
alopecia areata may also associated vitiligo conditions thought autoimmune processes
also appears association alopecia areata organ specific endocrine disorders particularly thyroid disease
within past two decades character ringworm scalp changed dramatically
classic tinea capitis occurred single multiple annular patches dull scaly alopecia containing small stubble many broken hairs
majority causative organisms produced metabolites fluoresced yellow green long wave ultraviolet wood light
diagnosis confirmed digesting hair remnant potassium hydroxide solution microscopically viewing fungal spores clustered hair
relative ease diagnosis development effective therapy eliminated classic genera selectively allowed fungi flourish
tineas seen currently fluoresce
infections deep within follicle produce called black dot ringworm
hairs surface difficult obtain direct microscopic examination
clinical presentations always regular circles may irregular inflammatory
also produce scarring
current tineas scalp require high index suspicion energetic laboratory investigation including cultures biopsy establish diagnosis
early stages diffuse loss noticed increased hair fallout later shows general thinning clearly visible underlying scalp
apparent early fallout usually confirmed either tug traction test already described patient save count daily hair loss
wide variety conditions factors may precipitate temporary shedding increased numbers otherwise normal telogen hairs
common tendency attribute findings patient nerves based anecdotal reports associations viewed skepticism
postpartum effluvium hormonal influences last trimester pregnancy appear inhibit normal shedding hair women notice thicker luxuriant growth
postnatal period condition reverses within weeks months delivery accelerated loss telogen hairs occurs
delayed shedding causes great concern hair merely returns prepregnancy status
alarmed patients require assurance event temporary real loss hair
febrile toxic effluvium another form noncicatricial alopecia
severe illnesses particularly infectious diseases marked high fevers may associated telogen effluvium
uncommon moth eaten alopecia syphilis probably best known example
complete restitution hair follows appropriate therapy underlying disease
alopecia variety also seen patients undertake rapid weight reduction starvation diets
drug associated hair loss result wide variety agents
progestogen oral contraceptives high doses vitamin newer therapeutic retinoids cimetidine beta blocking agents nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents among others produce temporary telogen hair loss
coumadin heparin anticoagulants appear special proclivity producing telogen effluvium rights even continued therapy
drugs poisons selectively toxic effects cells high metabolic mitotic activity like cancer cells affect hair matrix
cancer chemotherapeutic agents x rays heavy metals arsenic lead thallium bismuth abruptly halt production hair
