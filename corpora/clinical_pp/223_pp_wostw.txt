four principal routes infections may transmitted patient physician vice versa form basis hospital infection control guidelines
contact transmission important manner physicians may contract spread infectious diseases
may occur direct physical contact e g examining wound indirect contact formite e g changing wound dressings using contaminated medical instrument droplet contact airborne infectious agents spread short distances coughing sneezing
nosocomial infection multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria example derives contact spread microorganisms physicians staff
vehicular transmission involves contaminated objects example food salmonellosis blood hepatitis water legionellosis drugs supplies e g contaminated intravenous catheters intravenous fluids drugs
airborne transmission implies dissemination infectious particles suspended air e g tuberculosis often long distances
vector transmission insect animal spread relevant geographic medicine clinical practice
important microbial clinical factors relating specific circumstances encounter physician patient also influence contagiousness likelihood successful transmission infectious disease
example large inoculum organisms increases chance infection regardless intrinsic capacity organism cause human disease hence otherwise harmless organism ingested large numbers may cause fever vomiting e g bacillus cereus common cause food poisoning
microorganisms vary greatly among species even among strains within species e g highly variable disease results infection various strains escherichia coli capacity cause human disease severity types symptoms cause
characteristics referred virulence organism
condition state immunity host important age vaccination history presence comorbid chronic diseases previous encounters particular microorganism status host immune system e g leukemic patients intactness usual defenses cough free drainage urinary tract healthy skin presence normal resident bacterial flora determine whether infection occurs manifested
centers disease control recommends hospitals use one two isolation procedure systems traditional disease specific system newer category specific system groups together diseases call similar isolation precautions
listed table
community acquired adult contagious diseases physician might encounter general hospital usual infectious materials important exceptions may occur especially immunocompromised hosts usual type duration isolation
detailed recommendations found references end chapter
many infectious diseases require isolation fungal infections arthropod borne viral rickettsial infections bronchitis viral upper respiratory infections adults food poisoning infectious mononucleosis sexually transmitted diseases require little commonsense approach patient management
category specific isolation precautions recommended centers disease control cdc listed table
individual hospitals may modify supplement guidelines meet needs physicians discuss modifications may help meet particular patient needs hospital epidemiologist appropriate
isolation may instituted physician order hospitals nurses infection control committee
usually discontinued illness infectious lesion resolved cultures caused institution isolation negative shortly effective treatment instituted easy treat community acquired infections e g meningococcal infections
cdc recommended patients type bloodbody fluid bbf precautions referred universal precautions history examination reliably identify patients infected hiv bloodborne pathogens
barrier precautions gloves masks eyewear gowns used routinely appropriate circumstances contact blood tissue fluids semen vaginal fluid anticipated
hands washed glove removal contaminated skin washed exposure
special precautions prevent puncture injuries observed
mouth protection used mouth mouth resuscitation
contact weeping skin lesions avoided
pregnant health care workers special risk especially observant precautions
physicians ethically obliged follow isolation guidelines compulsively protection patients
lapses following rules acutely noted caregivers patient family
isolation must remembered harmless
elderly patients may become disoriented patients become depressed friends hesitant visit nursing care may suffer physicians become reluctant touch patients visit frequently isolation procedures instituted
hospital acquired infections defined ones present incubating hospital admission occur approximately admissions older immunocompromised patients however much higher incidence nosocomial infection
infections occur hospitalization prolonged average days health care expenses greatly increased morbidity mortality experienced primary illness increased
nosocomial infections often caused multiple antibiotic resistant organisms e g pseudomonas serratia acinetobacter enterobacter rarely encountered community acquired infections successful treatment organisms difficult requiring complicated expensive toxic antibiotic regimens
physicians nurses health care workers hospital large degree responsible spread bacteria permitting colonize respiratory tracts urinary tracts skin patients might otherwise colonized less virulent antibiotic sensitive organisms
commonly observed example urinary infections often occur clusters patients infected strain multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria apparent epidemiologic connections patients physicians nurses
compulsive handwashing every patient examined whether known infected prudent
patients infected wounds respiratory infections cellulitis decubitus ulcers urinary infections may infected virulent multiple antibiotic resistant organisms
table
lists standard precautions exercised patients recognized potentially contagious infection
infected patients placed isolation touched caution gloves mask used common sense dictates hands carefully washed going next patient
health care workers rarely contract infectious diseases patients infections represent special risk vaccination treatment surveillance recommended many hospitals fact require vaccinations reduce employee absenteeism protect employees patients requirements result nearly universal poor compliance hospital workers reasonable recommendations
health care workers evidence past hepatitis b infection anti hbs anti hbc positive approximately carriers hbsag positive
personnel high risk exposure blood patients hepatitis b carriers e g hemodialysis workers laboratory personnel surgeons pathologists receive three intramuscular doses hepatitis b vaccine immunization optional lower risk personnel
actual percutaneous exposure patient blood usually needlestick requires first assessment likelihood blood hbsag positive
source blood unknown testing hbsag require hours ml immune serum globulin isg provides protection hepatitis b may given low risk exposures however reasonable option treat
high risk exposures require hours determine infectivity blood ml isg given known likely exposures hbsag containing blood two options available
single ml dose hepatitis b immune globulin hbig ml hepatitis b vaccine may given separate sites within hours repeat doses vaccine months
alternatively ml hbig given intramuscularly within hours repeated month regimen costly probably less effective
isg given waiting hbig immediately available
persons immunized hepatitis b vaccine adequate hbsab levels already positive hbsab prior infection require either active passive immunization
personnel percutaneous exposure blood patients non non b hepatitis may given ml isg
effectiveness ameliorating preventing infection possible established isg however safe inexpensive
nosocomial exposure unlikely isg ml given soon possible exposure occur
hospital personnel working pregnant women personnel hospitals screened immunity rubella
seronegative receive rubella vaccine
vaccination health care personnel without prior serologic testing cost effective often politically unacceptable option
hospital personnel may transmit influenza immunocompromised elderly patients therefore advised immunized regularly patients benefit moreover absenteeism among infected health care workers would compromise ability care large numbers sick persons
compliance recommendation universally low
amantidine prophylaxis health care workers outbreaks another option
varicella highly contagious fewer adults susceptible infection
adult chickenpox often severe childhood infection health care workers without history chickenpox avoid contact infected patients dressings clothing
accidental exposure possible respiratory spread may occur vesicles appear circumstances fluorescent antibody membrane antigen assay used document whether health care worker prior immunity
nonimmune exposed employees work days exposure may considered candidates varicella zoster immune globulin vzig usually reserved high risk exposures past e g immunocompromised hosts
vesicles varicella zoster also contagious less
covering vesicles dressings greatly reduces risk nonimmune caregivers
health care workers may develop painful herpetic whitlows paronychia contact patients herpes virus vesicles workers oral herpes may transmit serious infection immunocompromised patients newborns patients burns
oral acyclovir treatment accelerate healing decrease infectious period primary secondary herpes infections encouraged
pregnant health care workers may likely exposed cytomegalovirus cmv women working hospital setting patients likely cmv infections e g older patients seronegative hepatitis transplant aids patients avoided
aids associated virus hiv infectiousthe risk infection needlestick less compared hepatitis band easily inactivated standard disinfection procedures
casual contact never leads infection
handful health care workers become infected result work related exposure consequences nevertheless grave require care part risk exposure
universal precautions recommended patients prevent transmission hiv bloodborne diseases plus relevant type precaution patients contracted infectious diseases e g tuberculosis salmonella enteritis
prevalence active tuberculosis declines previous routinely experienced conversion ppds medical students residents positive longer seen
although hospitals still recommend routine screening baseline periodic skin testing reasonably reserved recently exposed hospitals geographic regions known high prevalence active tuberculosis health care workers higher risk exposure
knowledge booster effect skin testing important health care workers routinely tested person previous tuberculosis exposure becomes skin test negative time reverts positive initial skin test incorrectly assumed recent converter ppd repeated year later
two stage testing done therefore health care workers years old whose first skin test negative
tuberculin negative health care workers retested months exposure patient active tuberculosis
possibility respiratory symptoms health care workers may due tuberculosis seriously considered chance transmitting tuberculosis older immunocompromised patients
healthy persons may colonized neisseria meningitidis
patients meningococcal meningitis however presumed infected relatively virulent strain likely result development meningitis close contacts become colonized
usual risk health care providers negligible intimate contact patients yet received hours effective antibiotic therapy may given rifampin mg twice daily days
absence data indicating increased risk health care workers perhaps rational approach close surveillance days ensure early treatment secondary cases
