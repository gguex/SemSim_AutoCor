measure serum total co content lieu measuring serum bicarbonate
total co content includes serum bicarbonate well available forms carbon dioxide e dissolved co carbonic acid
generally serum bicarbonate comprises total co content thus use measurement excellent estimator serum bicarbonate
total co content normally equals meql serum
laboratories use autoanalyzer measuring total co content
method measures amount co liberated sample adding strong acid
co diffuses across dialysis membrane
bicarbonate carbonate buffer solution containing indicator dye absorbs co
colorimeter evaluates new color converts total co measurement
two potential problems exist method color reagent may change time thus laboratory must frequently check standardization curves exposure sample air allow loss co much meql hour
arterial blood gas reports generally include bicarbonate value
blood gas machine measures ph pco calculates bicarbonate value using henderson hasselbalch equation
generally concurrent venous total co content exceed value less meql meql represents difference venous arterial blood remaining difference comes dissolved co
kidneys lungs maintain daily acid base balance
understanding normal physiology allows us appreciate abnormalities
discussion refers bicarbonate rather total co content measure total co content surrogate bicarbonate
bicarbonate carbonic acid constitute major buffer pair body fluids
carbonic acid dissociates hydrogen ion bicarbonate dissociation constant
Ã—
carbonic acid also maintains equilibrium ho co
usually describe dissociation constants hydrogen ion concentrations negative logarithms
thus negative logarithm dissociation constant equals
value called pka
normal hydrogen ion concentration equals nanoequivalentsliter corresponding ph
familiar henderson hasselbalch equation derives facts
carbonic acid concentration proportional partial pressure carbon dioxide pco blood
multiplying pco constant
estimates carbonic acid concentration giving useful form equation
changes hydrogen ion concentration ph result changes either bicarbonate carbon dioxide
measurement total co content help us explain acid base disorders ph pco known
furthermore since often measure total co content part automated chemistry determinations measurement provide first clue acid base disturbances
produce approximately meqkg daily hydrogen ions derived metabolism proteins primarily
kidney normally excretes daily acid load
failure excretion forces reaction h hco resulting decrease bicarbonate concentration
bicarbonate reabsorption occurs primarily proximal tubule
carbonic anhydrase controls absorption
patient volume status major influence absorption since sodium reabsorbed along bicarbonate
thus volume contraction stimulates sodium bicarbonate reabsorption
results increased total co content
likewise volume expansion lead mild decrease total co content
hydrogen ion concentration ph another major determinant bicarbonate reabsorption
thus kidney respond changes ventilation pco compensatory changes bicarbonate reabsorption
example chronic hypoventilation pco causes decreased ph
decreased ph stimulates bicarbonate reabsorption thus patient increased total co content
major caveat concerning total co content involves interpretation isolated measurement
one diagnose acid base disturbances isolated total comeasurement
order characterize acid base disturbance one needs ph pco total co well measurement anion gap
given caveat one use following guidelines
low levels total co result either metabolic acidosis compensation respiratory alkalosis
bicarbonate levels meql virtually identify metabolic acidosis cause compensation respiratory alkalosis drive bicarbonate low
metabolic acidosis present one distinguish increased anion gap nonanion gap acidosis
simplest formula anion gap
table
lists differential anion gap acidosis
generally one consider differential gap exceeds meql
table
gives differential nonanion gap acidosis
similar interpretation decreased bicarbonate level increased bicarbonate level may result either metabolic alkalosis compensation respiratory acidosis
table
lists causes metabolic alkalosis
summary serum total co content give clues acid base abnormalities
used conjunction ph pco measurement helps us define possible causes metabolic imbalance especially acutely ill patients
