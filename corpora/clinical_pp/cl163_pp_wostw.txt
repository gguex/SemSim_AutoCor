temporomandibular joint tmj articulation mandibular condyle glenoid fossa temporal bone
normal movement mandible depends proper function tmj
externally preauricular area lies directly joint
begin inspecting preauricular area swelling erythema
palpate directly joint patient opens closes mandible extent mandibular condylar movement assessed
normally condylar movement easily felt
patient close slowly feel condyle move posteriorly finger
tenderness elicited maneuver invariably associated articular inflammation
palpate superficial temporal artery nodularity tenderness
palpate masticatory cervical muscles search areas tenderness sustained contraction
begin sternocleidomastoid trapezius posterior cervical muscles
palpate masseter attachments zygomatic arch angle mandible temporalis temporal fossa intraorally along ascending ramus mandible medial pterygoid bimanually placing one finger externally medial aspect angle mandible finger orally lingual vestibule retromolar region
lateral pterygoid accessible examining finger intraorally posterior maxillary tuberosity
areas identified muscle spasm tenderness injected local anesthesia lidocaine
bupivacaine without epinephrine sprayed fluoromethane ethyl chloride determine areas cause patient symptoms
examine external auditory canal tympanic membrane otoscope tuning fork tests rule ear pathology particularly important patients complain hearing changes association tmj symptoms
audiogram may indicated hearing loss suspected
joint auscultated mandibular motion
normal joint functions relatively quietly
listen crepitus grinding clicking popping sounds
degree mandibular opening measured using distance incisal edges upper lower anterior teeth
opening less mm considered abnormal adult
upper limit normal patients exceed mm comfortably
observe opening pattern deviation
mandible often deviates toward affected side opening muscle spasm mechanical locking displaced meniscus
examine hands signs systemic disease e g heberden modes osteoarthrosis ulnar deviation rheumatoid arthritis may also involve tmj
laboratory tests e g complete blood count erythrocyte sedimentation rate rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibody serum uric acid helpful systemic cause tmj disease suspected
radiographs provide useful information bony architecture joint movement condyles mandibular opening
lateral transcranial films display anteroposterior contour bony joint structures whereas transpharyngeal transorbital x rays show mediolateral condylar anatomy
tomograms computed tomographic scan determine extent joint ankylosis tumor
arthrography magnetic resonance imaging mri helpful determining position movement integrity meniscus
temporomandibular articulation unique body two joints must always move simultaneously
two distinct movements rotation translation occur joint mandibular opening closing
tmj therefore called ginglymoarthroidal joint
mandibular opening initiated action suprahyoid muscles
simple rotation mandibular condyle glenoid fossa accounts first mm interincisal opening
opening due forward gliding translation condyle along posterior slope articular eminence
forward motion condyle guided action lateral pterygoid muscle
mandibular closure due action temporalis masseter medial pterygoid muscles
fibrocartilaginous disk meniscus less mm thick separates condyle glenoid fossa direct contact divides joint space superior inferior compartments
disk normally attached condyle medially laterally moves
condition tumor muscle spasm fracture ankylosis displaced meniscus prevents normal translation one condyle prevent contralateral condyle sliding forward normally
result deviation chin toward affected side
translation condyles prevented bilaterally mandibular opening restricted usually less mm
temporomandibular joint disorders classified extraarticular intraarticular
extraarticular disorders tmj common intraarticular patients intra extraarticulation involvement exists simultaneously
tmj disorders common source patient complaints physician
extraarticular disorders include myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome mpds temporal arteritis psychopathology
mpds common affliction musculature surrounding joint
seen often young adult females may occur age group
mpds due sustained contraction masticatory muscles clenching bruxism jaw thrusting response stress
repetition parafunctional maneuvers establishes self perpetuating cycle pain muscle spasm often spreads beyond muscles mastication involve muscle groups e g sternocleidomastoid trapezius posterior cervical head neck region
classic syndrome may unilateral bilateral includes complaint pain tmj area tenderness andor spasm masticatory muscles affected sides limited mandibular opening deviation
except mpds secondary intraarticular disease joint radiographs show normal bony architecture limited absent translatory condylar movement
patients psychiatric disturbances may complain tmj pain dysfunction
complaints proportion physical findings
symptoms relieved following institution appropriate psychiatric care psychotropic medications
intraarticular conditions tmj include dislocation arthritis ankylosis meniscus disorders tumors
dislocation may occur result yawning prolonged opening jaw trauma pernicious habit neuromuscular disorders
condyle extreme mandibular opening translates forward anterior articular eminence muscle spasm becomes lodged position
patient voluntarily return condyle glenoid fossa achieve mandibular closure
various arthritides e g degenerative joint disease rheumatoid gouty septic may affect tmj alone association generalized condition
crepitus often heard joint mandibular motion
associated mpds common
generalized manifestations underlying disease often found
many patients arthritis elsewhere develop tmj involvement may initial presentation cases
ankylosis joint may either fibrous bony due infection rheumatoid collagen vascular arthritis trauma
mandibular opening generally limited mm less
differentiation mandibular hypomobility secondary coronoid process enlargement ankylosis made radiographs
displacement injury fibrocartilage disk within joint presents clicking popping deviation affected side jaw opening locking jaw disk completely blocks condylar translation limits mandibular opening less mm
mpds commonly accompanies situation
tumors joint uncommon
enlargement condyle coronoid process hyperplasia osteochondroma osteoma sarcoma causes progressive facial asymmetry change dental occlusion
pain limitation mandibular opening frequent associated complaints
