anemia chapter may produce pallor exertional dyspnea fatigability
duration symptoms may pinpoint time onset
absence severe anemia suggests long standing problem time physiologic adaptation
symptom jaundice suggests hemolytic anemia
anemias often hereditary family history explored similar anemia also splenectomies cholecystectomies early life painful crises
general practice anemias secondary anemia chronic inflammatory disease anemia renal failure
therefore history concomitant disease always important
next common cause anemia iron deficiency
content iron diet assessed
careful questioning made possible source bleeding especially menstrual history history gastrointestinal blood loss
polycythemia often produces plethora time first recognition red face may help
long duration especially associated cyanosis would keeping secondary polycythemia whereas duration years months would suggest polycythemia vera
granulocytopenia immune system diseases characterized susceptibility infection
frequency type infection carefully documented
various white cells granulocytes monocytes lymphocytes often involved malignant proliferation
may produce lymphoma leukemia
may result administration drugs distant past especially chemotherapeutic drugs illnesses
patient may aware large lymph node long time
diseases produce cytopenias leading symptoms attributable anemia thrombocytopenia granulocytopenia
diseases platelets clotting system lead bleeding thrombosis chapter
hereditary bleeding problems usually manifest early life lead appellation bleeder
family history explored bleeders joint bleeding bleeding surgery dental extractions
special attention paid mode heredity especially sex linkage
age patient onset frequency type bleeding important
hemophiliacs suffer hemarthroses hematuria apparently spontaneously seldom bleed elsewhere without injury
petechial bleeding rule thrombocytopenia seldom seen coagulation disorders except coumadin overdosage
preoperative screening possible bleeding problems mainstay questioning family history past history bleeding surgery dental extractions
drug history important patient bleeding problem screened preoperatively possibility
aspirin non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs interfere platelet function may lead oozing injury
number common drugs may produce thrombocytopenia e g quinine tonic water
patients may forget mention chronic coumadin therapy
new drug given patient coumadin may interact coumadin leading augmentation diminution effect change status anticoagulation
history exposure drugs chemicals often important hematologic disease
anemia granulocytopenia thrombocytopenia combination may produced drugs
drugs cancer chemotherapy drugs regularly produce cytopenia expected dose related side effect considered risk reversible
others produce cytopenia idiosyncratic mechanisms rare patient constituting unexpected hazard unrelated pharmacologic therapeutic effect
mechanisms immunologic metabolic others unknown
cytopenia process readily reverses discontinuation drug aplastic anemia seldom
long list drugs chemicals implicated cytopenia
benzene active chemical many others
among drugs frequently involved chloramphenicol phenylbutazone sulfonamides sorts including nonantibacterial ones gold salts anti epileptics
hallmark physical finding anemia pallor
conversely polycythemia plethora rubor
however variation individuals complexion casual inspection often fail elicit findings except extreme variations red cell count
comparison patient palm observer helpful
addition fingers hyperextended drive blood palms depths palmar lines remain red
red hemoglobin concentration less gdl
polycythemia plethora best observed conjunctiva underside tip tongue
presence jaundice helpful finding anemia pointed history
always necessary check presence splenomegaly hematologic illness
technique well described chapter
measurement spleen important comparing changes size index progression disease response therapy
measuring spleen find ridiculous attempt guess consistently position mid clavicular line cm clavicle
trace ink tip spleen quiet breathing draw line along costal margin
perpendicular distance tip costal margin easily reproducible day day
large spleen trace outline measure distance tip umbilicus right border spleen left right umbilicus
similar considerations apply lymph nodes
grasp node lightly forefinger thumb measure distance apart two digits
easier trying use calipers believe accurate
patient severe granulocytopenia unable make pus
since many manifestations infectionpus inflammation etc due granulocytes patient agranulocytosis may less indications locus infection usual
draining abscesses may look like punched ulcers little redness swelling exuding thin serous material rather pus
careful search lymph nodes lymph node bearing areas body must made patient leukemia lymphoma well palpation splenomegaly hepatomegaly chapters
masses abdomen elsewhere examined well mediastinal widening pleural effusion
sometimes one forgets careful examination skin
petechiae lower extremities easily missed
skin involvement lymphoproliferative disease may great significance may manifested scaly dermatitis
type bleeding bleeding disorder often importance example apparently spontaneous ecchymoses versus bleeding site venipuncture surgery
distinguish dangerous wet purpura gi tract bleeding active blood loss less ominous dry purpura petechiae small ecchymoses
former demands immediate action latter
