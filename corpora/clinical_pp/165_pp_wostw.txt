uric acid ultimate catabolite purine metabolism humans higher primates
weak organic acid physiologic conditions exists mainly monosodium salt
ph less may occur urine predominant form nonionized uric acid
solubility monosodium urate times greater uric acid aqueous solutions
solubility differential provides therapeutic rationale alkalinization urine ph greater
patients forming uric acid stones
upper limit plasma uric acid may defined statistical range normal population
epidemiologic studies united states generally accepted
mgdl upper limit adult men
mgdl women
physiochemical definition hyperuricemia may considered
mgdl measured specific uricase method
represents solubility limit urate plasma Â°c
levels beyond
result supersaturated solutions prone crystal formation
uric acid levels influenced age sex
prior puberty average serum uric acid
mgdl males females
following puberty values rise adult levels women typically mgdl less men
lower level women apparently reflects estrogen related enhancement renal urate clearance disappears menopause
many additional factors including exercise diet drugs state hydration may result transient fluctuations uric acid levels
currently two methods widely utilized quantify uric acid
colorimetric method depends reduction chromogen sodium tungstate uric acid produce measurable color change
technique commonly employed automated hospital screening sma systems
method measures materials urate ascorbic acid
colorimetric determinations generally considered overestimation true uric acid levels normal range usually mgdl higher specific enzymatic techniques
enzymatic determination uric acid results specific oxidation uric acid uricase converts substrate allantoin
differential absorbance substances nm allows quantification
although traditionally expensive technique uricase methods currently available sma systems comparable costs gradually replacing less specific colorimetric method
serum uric acid reflects interactions four major processes dietary purine intake endogenous purine metabolism urinary urate excretion intestinal uricolysis
typical american diet may provide significant purine load
humans depend exogenous purines serve precursors tissue nucleic acids nearly dietary component directly converted uric acid
xanthine oxidase enzyme responsible conversion oxypurines uric acid found abundance liver mucosa small intestine
dietary nucleic acids ingested form nucleoproteins metabolized uric acid level gut mucosa
dietary manipulation mainstay antihyperuricemic therapy
nevertheless even rigid purine free diets result modest reductions serum uric acid generally range mgdl
advent potent antihyperuricemic drugs resulted diminished emphasis therapeutic role diet
nonetheless certain foods organ meats rich purines cause significant flux serum uric acid ingested sufficient quantities
endogenous purines derived de novo biosynthesis breakdown tissue nucleic acids
measurement true rate endogenous purine turnover requires isotopic dilution techniques carried patients severely restricted dietary purines
practical approach patients normal renal function taking uricosuric agents involves measurement hour urine collection uric acid
provides crude estimate rate purine production
purine restricted diets commonly accepted upper limit uric acid excretion mg hr
unrestricted diet limit raised mg hr
minority patients primary hyperuricemia excrete excessive amounts uric acid
small fraction patients specific regulatory enzyme defect identified
hyperuricemia secondary hematologic diseases characterized increased cellular turnover hemolytic myeloproliferative disorders associated increased urinary excretion uric acid
accelerated turnover nucleic acids disorders results compensatory increase rate purine biosynthesis
finally certain exogenous substances methylene blue fructose may stimulate purine biosynthesis
kidney major site removal uric acid accounts two thirds three fourths daily losses
urate excretion believed depend system includes four components glomerular filtration proximal tubular reabsorption secretion postsecretory reabsorption
primary hyperuricemia gout patients demonstrate defect renal handling uric acid
theory failure model components could involved development hyperuricemia patients
present exact site defect remains unresolved
diminished glomerular filtration rate renal failure lead secondary hyperuricemia
diuretics increase serum uric acid multiple mechanisms including increase tubular reabsorption
secretory mechanism uric acid may inhibited number organic acids including lactate betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate
accounts part hyperuricemia seen diabetic ketoacidosis lactic acidosis
salicylates low dose less
gmday impair secretory mechanism raise serum uric acid levels
higher doses inhibit urate absorption producing urate diuresis reduction serum uric acid
one quarter one third uric acid normally disposed intestinal uricolysis carried enzymes gut bacterial flora
uric acid reaches intestines alimentary secretions including saliva bile gastric pancreatic intestinal juices
hyperuricemia secondary failure intestinal uricolysis recognized
role intestinal degradation expands patients renal insufficiency may account much urate elimination
hyperuricemia may conveniently divided two major categories
symptomatic hyperuricemia manifested gout nephrolithiasis uric acid nephropathy
larger group patients asymptomatic hyperuricemia
patients eventually become symptomatic
risk acute gouty arthritis increases level serum uric acid duration hyperuricemia
acute fluctuations serum uric acid may associated precipitation acute gouty arthritis
sudden reductions serum uric acid may accompany introduction antihyperuricemic therapy hence patients often simultaneously begin prophylactic doses colchicine
nephrolithiasis may accompany gouty arthropathy occur independent problem
uric acid forms radiolucent stones may contribute formation calcium stones
patients gout risk stone formation rises level serum uric acid
better correlation exists stone formation urinary uric acid excretion
one study found prevalence stones gouty patients excreting greater mg uric acid per hours
acute uric acid nephropathy results precipitation uric acid crystals within collecting tubules ureters
severe form acute renal failure classically associated chemotherapy leukemias lymphomas
may also occur following strenuous exercise epileptic seizures
hyperuricosuria aciduria urine concentration seem act concert produce syndrome
diagnosis made demonstration uric acid creatinine ratio greater setting acute renal failure
routine screening hospitalized patients identify substantial number elevated serum uric acid related symptoms
patients remain asymptomatic throughout lives
complete discussion management asymptomatic hyperuricemia beyond scope chapter
suffice say weight current evidence speaks normalization uric acid asymptomatic patients
regardless level uric acid little seems lost awaiting onset first bout arthritis kidney stone
hypouricemia commonly defined serum urate concentration mgdl less
low serum urate concentration may result decreased production increased excretion
quantification urinary uric acid facilitate distinction two mechanisms
patients hypouricemia secondary impaired production little urinary uric acid
hypouricemia found hospitalized patients
cases cause related drugs including salicylates allopurinol x ray contrast agents glyceryl guaiacholate
forced diuresis used mainly treatment suicide attempt patients renal colic may result hypouricemia
total parenteral nutrition cause profound hypouricemia patients
several malignant diseases associated hypouricemia including hodgkin disease sarcoma glioblastoma variety carcinomas
multiple myeloma light chains likely cause tubular epithelial damage fanconi syndrome
malignancies also associated tubular dysfunction increased renal clearance urate
inappropriate secretion antidiuretic hormone accompanies malignancies may lower serum uric acid
decreased xanthine oxidase activity acquired development malignancy appears uncommon mechanism
hypouricemia produces symptoms known morbidity
fortuitous discovery automated chemistry screening requires therapy alert physician search underlying cause
