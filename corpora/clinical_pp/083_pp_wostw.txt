indigestion term commonly used patients physicians indicate form gastrointestinal tract upset
includes wide variety symptoms turn may manifestations wide variety gastrointestinal nongastrointestinal diseases
often symptoms prove reflection gastroduodenal dysfunction secondary stress
words indigestion dyspepsia may used interchangeably usually describe one symptoms experienced shortly eating simply implying disorder digestive processes
among symptoms postprandial nausea occasionally emesis upper abdominal bloating fullness discomfort belching flatulence less commonly bad taste mouth coated tongue fatigue somnolence headache
occasionally patients use term indigestion describe symptoms heartburn heartburn however defined specifically substernal burning sensation variable intensity may extend toward neck base throat
understand patient symptoms

meals eaten run relaxed manner
ongoing unusual stressful life situations emotional conflicts
symptoms associated identifiable stressful situations
respect indigestion inquire symptoms search signs variety gastrointestinal extragastrointestinal disorders differential diagnostic considerations extensive
heartburn inquire occasionally associated acidic bilious regurgitation dysphagia odynophagia chest pain last symptom diffuse esophageal spasm
patients complaints indigestion andor heartburn thorough inquiry underlying psychosocial factors major importance emotional stress conflict frequently prove causative
symptoms may augmented patient anxiety physical well
appropriate diagnostic studies reassured patient physician parties begin deal effectively underlying emotional basis patient symptoms
postprandial upper abdominal fullness may result excessive intake food drink especially carbonated beverages complaint indigestion likely consequence aerophagia gastric distention delayed gastric emptying latter secondary mechanical motor disturbance
occasionally large esophageal diverticula esophageal strictures malignant benign esophageal motor disturbances seen achalasia scleroderrna may result similar postprandial fullness may described indigestion
preceding gastric resectional surgery treatment gastric malignancy peptic ulcer may significantly reduce gastric capacity resulting postprandial fullness indigestion
associated bilious reflux also may symptomatic
stomach thought two functional units proximal reservoir fundus body distal pumping area mixing emptying antrum
pylorus low pressure sphincter prevents large particles food exiting also prevents reflux duodenal content stomach
liquids exit stomach faster solids
delivery gastric content duodenum dependent presence cycle per minute electrical control activity periodic antral contractions occurring response second electrical event known electrical response activity
entire process governed complex neural humoral factors
rate gastric emptying may inhibited meals high osmotic pressure high fat content inhibitory receptors probably located duodenum proximal jejunum
studies hunt stubbs yielded data indicating nutritive density kilocalories per milliliter rather initial volume determines rate gastric emptying
isocaloric amounts fat protein carbohydrate apparently cause equal slowing gastric emptying
inhibitory activity mediated neural hormonal mechanisms presumably interactions
metabolic products ingested food also may play role
relative importance neural hormonal factors regulation gastric emptying remains uncertain
gastrointestinal hormones gastrin secretin cck pz inhibit gastric emptying
gip gastric inhibitory peptide vip vasoactive intestinal peptide also retard gastric emptying whereas motilin increases gastric motility
enterogastrone crude intestinal extract liberated duodenum micellar fat exposure also inhibits gastric emptying
sympathetic vagal inhibitory gastric innervation involved retarding gastric emptying
examples diseases mechanical pyloric obstruction accounts delays gastric emptying include tumors peptic ulcer disease idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
examples conditions acute chronic delays gastric emptying observed absence mechanical obstruction given table
causes impaired gastric emptying many conditions remain incompletely understood
gastric emptying may altered variably vagotomy variety surgical procedures sometimes lead dumping occasionally lead chronic gastric retention nutritional compromise occasional formation bezoars
atrophic gastritis gastric ulcer gastric cancer sometimes associated delayed gastric emptying mechanisms obscure
medications wide variety cause symptoms indigestion presumed direct gastric irritation e g acetylsalicylic acid nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs central effects e g morphine anticholinergic effects side effects e g atropine various antispasmodics phenothiazines
bloating one common complaints patient indigestion may attributable gastrointestinal gas
latter derived swallowed air gut bacterial metabolism
postprandial bloating belching often related aerophagia sometimes habit anxious individuals occasionally aggravated ingestion carbonated beverages gum chewing
complaints bloating flatulence common patients irritable bowel syndrome apparently result underlying motility disturbance decreased pain threshold result qualitative quantative differences intestinal gas formation comparison normal controls clarified lasser bond levitt
heartburn frequent symptom gastroesophageal reflux experienced variably response esophagitis caused reflux irritant acid peptic occasionally alkaline gastric gastroduodenal content
presumably reflux often consequence incompetent lower esophageal sphincter les manometrically demonstrable segment high pressure normally maintained junction esophagus stomach
factors influencing gastroesophageal reflux effects include competency les volume gastric content quantity corrosiveness refluxed material clearance material esophagus local esophageal tissue resistance
delayed gastric emptying also may contribute symptoms gastroesophageal reflux patients
patients may experience increased heartburn overeating recumbency following meals eating spicy foods fatty foods chocolate drinking citrus juices cola drinks coffee alcohol smoking
preceding cause reduction lower esophageal sphincter pressure presumed consequent increased gastroesophageal reflux
anticholinergic medications may similar effects
alkaline reflux esophagitis may observed patients without preceding gastric resectional surgery operations well gastroenterostomy particularly predispose problem
sense fullness bloating upper abdominal discomfort distention meals common parlance indigestion suggests aerophagia andor impaired delayed gastric emptying
former usually nervous habit latter usually result mechanical pyloric gastric outlet obstruction secondary multitude nonmechanical causes including emotional factors
delay gastric emptying may evidenced obvious gastric distention physical examination plain abdominal x rays emesis undigested food many hours consumption apparent retained food stomach noted time upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies upper endoscopy
may assessed means radiopaque meals intubation sampling isotope studies
common causes mechanical pyloric gastric outlet obstruction tumors polyps carcinoma narrowing secondary acute inflammation edema chronic scarring peptic ulcer disease idiopathic pyloric hypertrophy
neoplastic infiltrative processes involving stomach primarily e g carcinoma gastroduodenal crohn disease secondarily e g pancreatic carcinoma also may cause gastric outlet obstruction
common causes nonmechanical gastric retention include gastrointestinal extragastrointestinal conditions listed table
diseases diverse scleroderma acute gastroenteritis also may result delayed gastric emptying
perhaps largest group patients indigestion anxiety stress chief determinants called psychophysiologic gastrointestinal reaction
group extensive clinical evaluation yields apparent organic explanation symptoms
heartburn usually result acid alkaline gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis
gastroesophageal reflux demonstrated means barium studies manometric placement ph probe radioisotope study
patient gives classic description heartburn study rarely needed
one uncertain source patient symptoms bernstein test done
briefly stated test monitors patient response acid perfusion esophagus
test often helpful means always conclusive
endoscopic findings esophagitis run gamut imperceptible grossly erythema frank erosions exudates even ulceration stricture formation
suction biopsies esophageal mucosa may demonstrate thickening basal layer elongation dermal pegs may extend nearly mucosal surface
manometric measurements lower esophageal sphincter tend low patients gastroesophageal reflux however patients normal pressures may symptoms reflux patients low pressures may
case many patients indigestion extensive studies patients complaining heartburn also may prove unrevealing
nevertheless comprehensive evaluation may serve basis effective therapeutic approach large group patients whose symptoms emotionally based
coronary artery disease producing angina often described patients indigestion heartburn sense fullness
valuable clue association duration exertion relief rest
