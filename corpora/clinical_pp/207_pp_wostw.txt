psychologic test set stimuli administered individual group standard conditions obtain sample behavior assessment
basically two kinds tests objective projective
objective test requires respondent make particular response structured set instructions e g truefalse yesno correct answer
projective test given ambiguous context order afford respondent opportunity impose interpretation answering
psychologic tests rarely given isolation part battery
one test sufficiently answer complex questions usually asked clinical situation
diagnostic questions require assessment personality intelligence perhaps even presence organic involvement
typical battery tests includes projective tests assess personality rorschach thematic apperception test tat objective personality test minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi semistructured test like rotter incomplete sentence test intelligence test usually wechsler adult intelligence scale revised wais r
important consideration physician ask psychologic assessment
medical diagnostic procedures interested finding answers diagnostic questions obtained direct observation interview
clinical experience myriad circumstances requiring psychologic consultation either assist rule medical intervention
typical situations include compliance behavioral management affirmation clinical findings use supportive drug therapies continuity care issues
five case examples offered illustrate situations
mr
year old single salesman hospitalized gastrointestinal problems associated previous operation
history noncompliance drugs nutrition regimens
severe debilitation would ensue following outpatient treatments would hospitalized
pattern repeated several times
psychologic assessment data consistent pattern addictive behavior poor coping mechanisms stressful conditions
recommendations included drug rehabilitation program stress management techniques
dr
l year old retired dentist severe behavioral management problems nursing staff
verbally punitive intrusive patients privacy
psychologic assessment revealed organic brain syndrome indicating greater individual care lower expectation performance
year old single male mr

clinical question whether given antidepressants antianxiety agents adjunct psychotherapeutic intervention
test results consistent state anxiety opposed affective disorder
ms
b
year old single female hospitalized following drug overdose suicide attempt
information needed determine dangerous restrictive environment needed treatment type therapy appropriate
test results confirmed compulsive personality dramatic flair
ms
b

nevertheless essential link outpatient care still motivated receive care
although examples means exhaustive point variety commonly occurring circumstances psychologic assessment may useful
important ordering testing formulate diagnostic question specific manner possible
requests describe personality dynamics rule psychologic disturbance general answer effective efficient manner
hesitate ask exactly want know
psychologist inform unable answer
use examples described formulate question patient depressed
patient psychotic
patient conforming treatment regimen
presenting patient psychologist evaluation helpful demographic data detailed history client
also description presented problems behavioral terms
saying patient appears depressed helpful describing loss appetite early morning rising slowness speech
patient management problem give concrete description entails wont go rehabilitation therapy wont let technician draw blood
finally referring physician may request either specific test abbreviated battery
psychologists go along practice encourage
psychologic tests particularly personality ones good skills individual administers interprets
psychologist must feel confident competent battery administers
therefore number choice tests psychologist medical procedures chosen patient responsibility physician charge

physician wants rule organic brain syndrome may call upon neuropsychologic testing
particularly true ct scan negative presence suspicious symptomatology early alheizmer disease assessing relative importance organic versus psychologic variables behavior trauma victims differentiating dementia depression elderly
cases intense work neurologic deficits required patient referred specialist neuropsychologic assessment
since procedure costly time consuming physician may want screen first presence brain dysfunction
psychologists well trained task
briefly describe two neuropsychologic tests useful screening purposes
necessarily endorse best available familiarity
first test aphasia screening test adapted reitan halsteadwepman aphasia screening test
assesses several areas dysfunction including dysphonia dyslexia spelling constructional dyspraxia dyscalculia
test uses sign approach positive findings distinct definite significance normal performance rule organicity
anyone basic grade school education capable answering every item correctly
test simple administer consists items usually require minutes complete
second called category test powerful halsteadreitan test battery
consists stimuli divided seven subtests
category test assesses central processing abstraction reasoning
cutoff score errors
reitan recommends use slide presentation design projector feedback system defillipis mccampbell designed much simpler method presentation
booklet category test bct portable requiring two loose leaf notebooks answer sheet

correlation bct category test
two major criticisms category test normative data reliability adequately studied
one study report test retest correlation
rorschach describes personality structure offering multidimensional picture individual current functioning potential
korner states rorschach shows personality work
several scoring systems rorschach based four major categories location determinants content use populars originals
location area response yields information respondent ability toward perceptual organization abstraction synthesis
determinants response refer qualities produce form shape color
tied personality variables emotionality impulsivity versus control openness versus constrictiveness
content block reveals personal meanings attitudes interests respondent
originals populars related respondent creativity reality testing conventionality among variables
whereas rorschach presents personality structure organization tat reflects content personality including needs pressures conflicts values interest
instances content given tat story revealing patient difficulties would reported verbatim psychologic report
certain cards said pull specific types themes card attitudes toward authority card attitudes toward heterosexual relationships card relationships mother figure
also diagnostic groups tend certain orientation toward stories
obsessive compulsives may pedantic
depressives may short stories monosyllabic words
schizophrenics may disjointed delusional content
three approaches interpretation mmpi single scale statistical clinical
many physicians order mmpi comfortable single scale approach
involves looking elevated scale making assumptions patient
stated eight clinical scales hs hypochondriasis depression hy hysteria pd psychopathic deviant pa paranoia pt psychothemia sc schizophrenia hypomania
although space permit description scales elevations associated diagnostic grouping related cluster symptoms example elevated hs associated immature person lack insight tends complain health
interpretation single scales must taken great caution
scales devised fit kraepelin system diagnosis outmoded
instance longer diagnostic grouping psychopathic deviate
scales much different meaning relation modern classifications
statistical approach interpretation involves code types
code type particular correlation elevated clinical scales e g
large sample patients given mmpi
grouped similarity code types
groupings correlated clinical demographic data notion patients similar mmpi profiles manifest similar problems
difficulty approach often called cookbook approach data tend generalize settings
third approach mmpi interpretation clinical approach
expert clinician depends knowledge personality dynamics case history current environmental circumstances formulate hypotheses psychologic difficulties respondent
mmpi computer generated report uses type approach
one extremely cautious relying heavily report author firsthand knowledge respondent
clinical psychologist administering mmpi use clinical approach seldom isolation without tests least clinical interview
rotter incomplete sentence blank screening device
found useful way obtaining content information similar tat patients threatened depressed take challenge making stories
rotter given several suggestions interpretation addition reliable scoring system
adjusted person tends produce stems neutral flippant
statements tend short concise humorous
maladjusted individual tends write longer sentences complicated emotionally charged
frequent theme nobody understands
unusual physicians question use intelligence testing patients
common assumption test relevant differential diagnosis
contrary assumption intelligence test essential part test battery
first general level intelligence determine much patient capable understanding therefore cooperating treatment
words concrete simplified need physician instructions
second intelligence test broad based screening organicity
verbal scale iq related left hemisphere functioning performance scale right hemisphere
significant difference approximately points two iqs requires intense assessment
dramatic difference given subscale mean mean scale may also cause concern
third important use results intelligence test relationship aspects personality functioning
example current state anxiety related subscale scores digit span picture completion
loose association similarity comprehension subtest may associated psychotic process
course ordering psychologic consultation question presence brain dysfunction physician may want order screening form category test aphasia screening test
category test powerful halsteadreitan battery
essentially processing test assessing abstraction reasoning
category test measures level performance offers information concerning localization
differentiation terms severity location specificity requires intense evaluation
quick screening localization would aphasia screening test
assesses left right hemisphere functioning respect language ability
respondent copy correctly might suspect right hemisphere lesion
hand name object might think left hemisphere lesion
use test many false negatives false positives
physician usually receives results psychologic assessments form psychologic report
variety formats describe typical one
report usually typed pages long enough raw data justice long impinge upon valuable time physician
first section description presentation respondent test taking behavior
next section describe respondent intellectual functioning strengths weaknesses presence organic symptoms
third section overview respondent current emotional social functioning may include samples actual test responses examples
final section psychologist summarizes findings offers recommendations
interpretation findings psychologic test batteries largely depends clinical acumen psychologist
organization synthesis test data require much skill knowledge personality dynamics
tests unique contribution overall clinical picture none stand
thus psychologist must determine relevant internally consistent central irrelevant diagnosis intervention
