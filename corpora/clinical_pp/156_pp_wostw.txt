reticulocytes erythroid cells peripheral blood discrete penultimate phase maturation
nucleus removed usually red cells enter peripheral blood
however extranuclear rna remains
residual rna generally lost progressively hours cell enters circulation
reticulocytes thus represent distinctive cohort cells recently entering peripheral blood
reticulocytes differ red cells convoluted shape larger mature cells
latter two distinctions clear cut presence residual rna
typical wright stain used routine examination earliest reticulocytes residual rna polychromatophil e bluish mature erythrocytes
standard technique new methylene blue stain
stain routinely done clinical hematology laboratory designed highlight rna blue color otherwise pink cell
depending stage reticulocyte blue color may distributed general early reticulocyte punctate late reticulocyte pattern
visual examination peripheral blood film stained number reticulocytes among erythrocytes found expressed percentage
termed reticulocyte count
assumed normal red cell life span days duration reticulocyte peripheral blood day
follows reticulocytes random time normal subject steady state
red cells
allowing variation red cell life span would theoretically give range
however considerable statistical variability number observations small
observer variability deciding positively stained minimum intraobserver interobserver variation
therefore duplicate error given reticulocyte percentage approaches normal subjects reticulocyte percentage varied average among five samples months
laboratories liberal others designating cells reticulocytes clinician must know local normal values range certain represent laboratory actual experience rather values given reference book
range normal values
reticulocyte percentage peripheral blood indication rapidity red cell turnover patient steady state
however number reticulocytes released blood reflects amount erythropoiesis given day
absolute number reticulocytes determined reticulocyte index corrected reticulocyte count
determine reticulocyte percentage adjusted ratio observed hematocrit expected hematocrit yielding absolute number reticulocytes
sometimes second correction made
subjectively judged pronounced polychromatophilia peripheral blood film assumed younger reticulocytes disproportionately numerous
younger reticulocytes retain rna longer average represent cohort cells perceived reticulocytes longer day
persistence reticulocytes would give falsely high percentage cells representing single day red cell production
magnitude second correction tends parallel first
instance reticulocyte count
hematocrit polychromasia seen slide
absolute number reticulocytes thus would double normal value
values duplicate error initial reticulocyte percentage error absolute reticulocyte number must least great
corrections would precise patient expected hematocrit could used denominator polychromasia could quantified
nonetheless two values provide complementary data
percentage proportional least value steady reciprocal red cell life span
absolute number gives amount erythropoiesis given day
interpreted obviously high substantially normal obviously low number allows valuable physiologic insight causes anemia
duplicate error measurement however interpretation small changes borderline abnormal values made caution
correlation reticulocyte percentage appearance polychromasia peripheral smear exact
normal subject blood may contain visible polychromatophilic cells despite say reticulocytes figure
subjects certain disorders may disproportionate number polychromatophilic cells percentage reticulocytes
reticulocytes said large enough cause increase mean cell volume mcv percentage markedly elevated
occurs small group subjects high reticulocyte percentagesthose chronic immune hemolytic anemia
latter patients thought shift erythropoiesis cell division skipped cells larger normal produced
otherwise reticulocytes larger red cells mature
therefore autoimmune hemolytic anemia increased red cell size mcv attributed reticulocytosis
new technique reticulocyte counting use flow cytometry
approach uses dye selectively stains rna distinguishes reticulocytes rna containing cells another variable size
technique yet widely used active study several centers
four abnormal patterns distinguished
shown figure correspond physiologically distinct group diseases
analogous group platelet disorders
reduced reticulocyte percentages seen bone marrow suppression
examples include cytotoxic chemotherapy aplastic anemia figure
anemia chronic disease also category
certain reticulocyte percentage abnormally low repeat measurement may necessary four five reticulocytes thousand cells counted
may within duplicate error normal
correction factors used absolute reticulocyte count percentage adjusted degree anemia may normal even though percentage normal
cases bone marrow responding appropriately anemia therefore absolute sense hypoproliferative
approach helps distinguish physiologically red cell disorders number andor proliferative activity bone marrow erythroid precursors deficient
however practice limitations described broad gray zone unclear whether reticulocyte percentage count normal
hypoplastic thrombocytopenia similar basis
increased reticulocyte percentages seen hemolytic disorders whether intrinsic e g hemoglobinopathy enzymopathy extrinsic e g traumatic heart valve acquired immune hemolytic anemia
long hemolytic cause corrected reticulocyte count remain elevated
particular danger patients chronic hemolytic anemia transient reticulocytopenia drug infection
normal subject marrow hypoplasia even week makes little difference week erythropoiesis red cell mass
contrast patient chronic hemolytic anemia reticulocyte percentage making cells day
cells continue destroyed prematurely even fall half accustomed hyperproduction could disastrous
therefore patient chronic hemolytic anemia e g sickle cell anemia interval reticulocyte counts well hemoglobin measured
extent hemolysis caused shift erythropoiesis cells larger
also anemia caused hemolysis greater proportion polychromatophilic cells figure b
therefore extremely high reticulocyte percentage may represent modest increase absolute erythropoiesis
disorders bone marrow precursors increased number also altered maturation
analogous changes platelet production immune thrombocytopenia
reticulocyte percentage also increased recovery nutritional anemia e g iron recovery erythropoiesis bone marrow suppression e g chemotherapy
marrow normal therapy degree reticulocytosis parallel degree anemia
similar pattern seen acute reticulocytosis following sudden blood loss
recovery progresses reticulocyte percentage abate normal
usually acute marrow responses shift erythropoiesis
reticulocyte percentage number high proportion polychromatophilic cells normal figure c
number marrow erythroid cells increased maturation normal
represents lesser perhaps qualitatively different stimulation bone marrow
similar reactive thrombocytosis
red cell volume distribution histogram available many automated blood counters valuable
noted marrow normal reticulocytes larger red cells mature
thought specific therapy reticulocytes abnormal size fl fl physician ask abnormality unmasked therapy
common macrocytic disorder due chronic liver disease folate vitamin b deficiency cytotoxic chemotherapy hidden low mcv iron deficiency iron therapy begun vice versa iron deficiency concealed megaloblastic deficiency
thus low reticulocyte percentage count reflects marrow unable compensate anemia
high reticulocyte percentage count reflects marrow attempting compensate red cell destruction recovering anemia
two clear cut extremes subjects reticulocyte percentages within normal range including technologic error
normal reticulocyte disorders include many cases nutritional disorders iron folate vitamin b deficiency confusing spectrum chronic liver disease alcohol abuse leukemias marrow infiltrative disorders nonanemic hemoglobinopathies hemoglobin ac
differential long usually specific tests needed establish diagnosis patients normal reticulocyte values
adjustment hematocrit polychromasia usually valuable cases marked anemia
polychromasia may increased peripheral blood smear even reticulocyte count percentage normal
finding suggests premature release erythroid cells marrow hyperactive
causes include marrow infiltration tumor granulomas marrow fibrosis
disorders presumed physiologic physical barrier keeping immature red cells circulation compromised
removal spleen cause little change sort splenectomy incidental otherwise hematologically normal subject
however subject already compromised bone marrow larger number abnormal cells exist including immature reticulocytes nucleated red cells
removal spleen removes major filter cells
therefore patients splenectomy marrow replacement fibrosis dramatic polychromasia despite modest reticulocyte percentage figure
similarly patients splenectomy marrow infiltration abnormally large platelets released

neither automated blood count abc reticulocyte count provide definitive specific diagnoses
characteristic set abc reticulocyte values may suggest small differential even one specific disorder
usually appropriate select specialized tests confirm definitive diagnosis
example anemia high reticulocyte percentage suggests hemolysis
depending data confirmatory test may hemoglobin electrophoresis coombs test etc
use abc reticulocyte percentage rapid inexpensive focus speed diagnosis limiting number slower costlier confirmatory tests
