stroking lateral part sole foot fairly sharp object produces plantar flexion big toe often also flexion adduction toes
normal response termed flexor plantar reflex
patients stroking sole produces extension dorsiflexion big toe often extension abduction fanning toes
abnormal response termed extensor plantar reflex babinski reflex
place patient supine position tell going scratch foot first gently vigorously
fixate foot grasping ankle medial surface examiner hand closest midline patient examiner left hand patient left foot tested vice versa right foot
begin light stroking using finger use blunt object point key
finally abnormal response obtained take tongue blade break half longitudinally use sharp point
reason graded stimuli twofold light touch finger frequently obtains reflex without causing withdrawal response occasion makes interpretation response difficult one conclude response normal noxious stimulus indeed used since reflex cutaneous nociceptive reflex
first line stroked begins centimeters distal heel situated junction dorsal plantar surfaces foot figure
line extends point behind toes turns medially across transverse arch foot
stroke slowly taking seconds complete motion
dig sole stroke
successive lines stroked cm medial preceding stroke examiner stroking midline foot
reason beginning laterally cases response abnormal laterally becomes normal midline approached
occurrence extensor response lines abnormal even response flexor another line stroking
variation relates variability receptive field reflex undoubtedly due extent corticospinal involvement well individual differences
reflex normal abnormal response obtained stroke lines using stimuli described
good habit describe whatever response obtained addition noting whether opinion response normal abnormal
neurophysiology reflex completely elucidated
account given follows suggestions made kugelberg eklund grimby result electromyographic studies
area skin body appears specific reflex response noxious stimuli
purpose reflex cause withdrawal area skin stimulus
reflex mediated spinal cord influenced higher centers
area skin reflex obtained known receptive field reflex
specific noxious stimulus sole foot receptive field causes immediate flexion toes ankle knee hip joints attendant withdrawal foot stimulus
remember experiences reflex example stepping sharp object barefoot
instant involuntary flexion joints withdrawal
another reflex normal individual great toe reflex stimulation ball toe receptive field causes extension dorsiflexion toe flexion ankle knee hip joints
differences two reflexes receptive fields fact great toe flexed one extended
reason extension toe reflex remove toe stimulus
abnormal plantar reflex babinski reflex elicitation toe extension wrong receptive field sole foot
thus noxious stimulus sole foot produces extension great toe instead normal flexion response
essential phenomenon appears recruitment extensor hallucus longus consequent overpowering toe flexors landau
movements joints remain
corticospinal tract influences segmental reflex spinal cord
corticospinal tract functioning properly result receptive field normal toe extensor reflex enlarges expense receptive field toe flexion
toe extension consequently elicited normally receptive field toe flexion
maintenance territorial integrity receptive fields apparently one way cortex exerts influence normal conditions
plantar reflex nociceptive segmental spinal reflex serves purpose protecting sole foot
clinical significance lies fact abnormal response reliably indicates metabolic structural abnormality corticospinal system upstream segmental reflex
thus extensor reflex observed structural lesions hemorrhage brain spinal cord tumors multiple sclerosis abnormal metabolic states hypoglycemia hypoxia anesthesia
disagreement whether response plantar flexion dorsiflexion majority newborns hogan milligan ross et al
cases however response become flexor sixth twelfth month life
rare occasions extensor reflex reported individuals otherwise normal however long term follow cases reported literature
summary widespread agreement among neurologists extensor plantar response sixth twelfth month life indicates structural metabolic dysfunction corticospinal system
receptive field extensor plantar response quite extensive
occasion extensor reflex elicited stimulating high face
even individual often shrinkage receptive field time passes occurrence lesion
reflex response occasion equivocal
example may flexion toes extension
landau addressed nicely question initial flexor movement toe followed extension
even abnormal response maximally developed illustrated case paraplegia early flexion may occur especially threshold stimulation
observations amount practically competent clinical judgment peculiar behavior god gift neurologist validity arbitrary rule concerning initial direction hallux movement
landau clare
occasion reflex may unequivocally flexor one side toe remains neutral without movement side
circumstances question whether evidence corticospinal tract dysfunction whether response flexor extensor
question often answered looking evidence corticospinal dysfunction repeating deep tendon reflexes
