constipation described terms character frequency stool
normal bowel frequency ranges three bowel movements per day one movement every three days
however well formed otherwise normal stool occurs week require therapy
constipated stool scyballousthat overdesiccated hard dry difficult pass
many symptoms incorrectly associated attributed constipation headache malaise bad taste mouth coated tongue
scientific basis caused constipation concept created tremendous market laxatives
fecal impaction refers hugh accumulation hard stool usually rectum passed size consistency
megacolon constipation carried extreme hugely dilated atonic colon containing massive amounts stool
patient suffers constipation usually consult physician different reasons
noticed change bowel habits
may request new laxative complaining one used longer effective
even though patient complaints except habitual infrequent bowel movements informed even warned frightened people media abnormal potentially dangerous habit
complains set symptoms attributed constipation subjective sensation incomplete emptying rectum lower abdominal discomfort malaise anorexia halitosis coated tongue abnormal distension flatulence
physician clarify patient means term constipation
ask patient following questions
mean dont move bowels often
move bowels right
often move bowels
mean stools become smaller
thinner
harder
dryer
difficult expel
feel stool remaining rectum
patient complain constipation spontaneously physician ask simple questions
often move bowels
noticed change bowel habits
noticed change bulk stools
feel emptied bowels entirely go toilet
contrast complex absorptive functions small bowel large bowel serves create store formed stool absorbing water liquid ileal contents
absorptive function addition water sodium bicarbonate
colonic function relative constipation due disordered motility either increased spasm decreased hypotonia
peristalsis seen esophagus gastric antrum small bowel occur colon unusual anatomy
circular muscle distributed unevenly areas thick muscle haustral folds separated thin rudimentary muscle layer
haustral folds become closer distally ending rectosigmoid junction
longitudinal muscle bunched three strips teniae contribute nonperistaltic propulsive activity
contrast well organized aboral peristaltic contractions esophagus colonic motility occurs either segrnental contractions mass action
segmental motility refers isolated contractions individual haustra creating bucket brigade effect
functions abnormally spasm seen spastic colon spastic diverticular disease pressure built isolated segment creating constipation pain without propulsive activity
mass action refers contractions large portion colon thrusting contents forward many haustral segments
may one causes borborygmi
stool normally stored sigmoid rectum rectum usually empty contains small amounts stool
formed stool passes sigmoid rectum creates afferent stimulus indicating need defecate
stimulus may suppressed unless quantity rectal contents becomes great proximal pressure high
increased intrarectal pressure causes relaxation internal anal sphincter composed smooth muscle
defecation occurs external anal sphincter also relaxed voluntarily whereas defecation suppressed external sphincter tone increases
act defecation supporting structures rectum contract create vertical passage augmented increased pressure within abdomen valsalva maneuver tensing abdominal wall musculature
primitive societies defecation routinely occurs squatting position enhancing vertical axis rectum
gastrointestinal tract active morning following meals
well defined gastrocolic reflex occurs gastric distention causing movement stool sigmoid rectum
thus best time move bowel following breakfast
commonest causes constipation
decreased stool weight bulk usually lack dietary fiber
certain fibers bran psyllium hygroscopic increasing stool water content weight
decreased propulsive activity usually medication occasionally intrinsic muscle disease scleroderma amyloid certain neurologic disorders
medications include anticholinergic properties antidepressants antiarrhythmic drugs opiates certain antacids calcium channel blockers laxatives
latter initially stimulate musculature bowel irritant properties repeated use induce hypotonia responds potent irritants ultimately resulting atonic colon
laxative addiction refers situation defecation occurs use laxative
suppression normal defecatory rectal stimulus voluntarily contracting external anal sphincter inconvenience painful anal disease thrombosed hemorrhoid anal fissure
depression
along decrease many bodily functions anorexia insomnia bowel function declines
decrease physical activity
exercise stimulates colonic motility saying thing constipated runner generally holds true
conversely sudden inactivity illness forcing bedrest frequently leads constipation
hypothyroidism
constipation rather lack energy may presenting symptom
constipation may acute chronic
acute change bowel habits particularly age cause concern may symptom colonic neoplasm
appropriate diagnostic studies including proctosigmoidoscopy flexible sigmoidoscopy plus air contrast barium enema colonoscopy performed concern regarding neoplasm exists
acute causes sudden decrease physical activity change diet particularly reducing fiber medications noted anal pain
chronic constipation common often difficult remedy
organic causes hypothyroidism ruled chronic constipation often falls two categories older patient well established laxative habit younger patient often female constipated lifestyle often headed toward laxative dependence
sigmoid spasm often contributes constipation interfering normal colonic motility colonic contents held proximal sigmoid resulting overdesiccation scyballous stools
documentation colonic hypomotility difficult
recently passage radiopaque markers followed serial radiographs utilized markers probably ate handled fashion colonic contents
megacolon extreme example constipation colon musculature hypotonic allowing huge fecal accumulations
congenital megacolon hirschsprung disease due aganglionic segment colon destroying normal neurologic defactory reflex
acquired megacolon due factors psychosis senility
simple effective method differentiating congenital acquired megacolon rectal examination
congenital megacolon rectum empty despite huge accumulations stool proximally psychogenic megacolon rectum lull stool
latter often associated constant fecal soiling encopresis spontaneous defecation night
additional sophisticated diagnostic studies include biopsy ganglion cells rectosphincteric manometry
readily diagnosable conditions e g neoplasm medication hypothyroidism excluded functional dietary factors must considered
common example chronic constipation young woman perfers extra half hour sleep morning eating breakfast attempting defecate spontaneously
indeed normal urge defecate morning may suppressed matter convenience
diet either junk food salad surprisingly low fiber
contrast popular opinion lettuce similar vegetables quite low fiber content see table large amounts salads would necessary supply fiber content ounce two bran cereal
begins lake laxatives matter expediency rapidly leading dependency
cycle broken several places eating breakfast containing one bran cereals taking time defecate breakfast encouraging increased physical activity stopping laxatives
enemas suppositories lesser evils stimulate rectosigmoid rectum respectively rather entire colon used retrain bowel
fiber therapy become appropriately popular among patients physicians creates physiologic stimulus increasing stool bulk thereby increasing colonic contractions
psyllium products methylcellulose artificial forms bran similarly hygroscopic
lactulose disaccharide digested intestine enters colon intact broken one two carbon fragments bacterial digestion creating osmotic load similar situation occurs milk ingested lactose deficient individual
lactulose may useful stimulating colonic emptying although patients frequently complain excess gas
lactulose nonlaxative colonic stimulant
metoclopramide stimulates peristalsis esophagus stomach small bowel colon
surgeons proposed surgical procedures correct constipation ranging subtotal colectomy segmental resections
theory inappropriate relaxation anal musculature prompted recommend anal myectomies
although isolated situations approach might useful many patients tried temporary relief occurs
