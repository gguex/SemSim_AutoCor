mental status examination structured assessment patient behavioral cognitive functioning
includes descriptions patient appearance general behavior level consciousness attentiveness motor speech activity mood affect thought perception attitude insight reaction evoked examiner finally higher cognitive abilities
specific cognitive functions alertness language memory constructional ability abstract reasoning clinically relevant
treatise insanity published pinel one fathers modern psychiatry gave advice contemporary colleagues
seize true character mental derangement given case pronounce infallible prognosis event often task particular delicacy requires united exertion great discernment extensive knowledge incorruptible integrity
one could scarcely improve advice present day approach mental status evaluation
knowledge modern physician bring bear task certainly much extensive
nevertheless observational skills subtle discriminations constitute great discernment traits professional scientific integrity likewise required must cultivated afresh generation physicians
mental status examination many respects lends less well systematic structured approach portions examination patient
one hand mental status testing threatening patient requires much cooperation part patient desirable leave mental status testing end overall evaluation patient placed ease degree rapport established examiner patient

successful clinician must develop style much mental status examination performed relatively unstructured observations made routine history physical
way patient relates history present illness reveal much general appearance behavior alertness speech activity affect attitude
primary technique mental status testing imposition structure observations raising level subliminal impressions clinically useful descriptions behavior
history evidence clinically significant psychiatric illness aberrant behavior thinking abnormalities neurologic examination difficulties day day performance job social situations formal dissecting specific cognitive abilities performed near close physician patient encounter
done examination needs introduced carefully patient explanation done order enlist patient cooperation rather resistance
structured mental status examination focus observations listed table
level consciousness refers state wakefulness patient depends brainstem cortical components
levels operationally defined strength stimuli needed elicit responses scheme plum posner widely accepted
normal level consciousness one patient able respond stimuli lower level strength people functioning without neurologic abnormality
clouded consciousness state reduced awareness whose main deficit one inattention
stimuli may perceived conscious level easily ignored misinterpreted
delirium acute subacute hours days onset grossly abnormal mental state often exhibiting fluctuating consciousness disorientation heightened irritability hallucinations
often associated toxic infectious metabolic disorders central nervous system
obtundation refers moderate reduction patient level awareness stimuli mild moderate intensity fail arouse arousal occur patient slow respond
stupor may defined unresponsiveness vigorous stimuli
patient quickly drifts back deep sleep like state cessation stimulation
coma unarousable unresponsiveness
vigorous noxious stimuli may may elicit reflex motor responses
examining patients reduced levels consciousness noting type stimulus needed arouse patient degree patient respond aroused useful way recording information
variables give examiner overall impression patient
patient physical appearance apparent vs
stated age grooming immaculateunkempt dress subduedriotous posture erectkyphotic eye contact directfurtive pertinent observations
certain specific syndromes unilateral spatial neglect disinhibited behavior frontal lobe syndrome readily appreciated observation behavior
listening spontaneous speech patient relates answers open ended questions yields much useful information
one might discern problems output articulation hypophonia parkinson disease halting speech patient word finding difficulties rapid pressured speech manic amphetamine intoxicated patient
overall motor activity also noted including tics unusual mannerisms
slowness loss spontaneity movement may characterize subcortical dementia depression akathisia motor restlessness may harbinger extrapyramidal syndrome secondary phenothiazine use
affect patient immediate expression emotion mood refers sustained emotional makeup patient personality
patients display range affect may described broad restricted labile flat
affect inappropriate consonance patient experiencing describing emotion showing time e g laughing relating recent death loved one
affect mood described dysphoric depression anxiety guilt euthymic normal euphoric implying pathologically elevated sense well
affect must judged context setting observations gone
example startled looking patient eyes wide open perspiration beading forehead soon recognized someone suffering parkinson disease paucity motion diminished eye blink noted beads perspiration turn seborrhea
inability process information correctly part definition psychotic thinking
patient perceives responds stimuli therefore critical psychiatric assessment
patient harbor realistic concerns concerns elevated level irrational fear
patient responding exaggerated fashion actual events discernible basis reality patient beliefs behavior
patients may exhibit marked tendencies toward somatization may troubled intrusive thoughts obsessive ideas
seriously ill patient may exhibit overtly delusional thinking fixed false belief held cultural peers persisting face objective contradictory evidence hallucinations false sensory perceptions without real stimuli illusions misperceptions real stimuli
patients often conceal experiences well ask leading questions ever seen heard things people could see hear
ever seen heard things later turned
likewise necessary interpret affirmative responses conservatively mistakenly hearing one name called experiencing hypnagogic hallucinations peri sleep period within realm normal experience
portions mental status examination evaluation potential thought disorder one difficult requires considerable experience
primary care physician frequently desire formal psychiatric consultation patients exhibiting disorders
patient attitude emotional tone displayed toward examiner individuals illness
may convey sense hostility anger helplessness pessimism overdramatization self centeredness passivity
likewise patient attitude toward illness important variable
patient help rejecting complainer
patient view illness psychiatric nonpsychiatric
patient look improvement resigned suffer silence
patient attitude often changes course interview important note changes
feelings aroused examiner patient often source useful information
data sometimes subtle easily overlooked examiner attempt remain objective fails note responding patient
developing sense dysphoria examiner may first clue physician dealing depressed patient
frustration may response help rejecting complainer feeling balance slightly touch conversation may early indication one dealing schizophrenic patient
preceding sections mental status examination provide gestalt view patient illness
structured examination specific cognitive abilities reductionistic approach patient pays careful attention neuroanatomic correlates
testing logically follows hierarchic ordering cortical function attention memory basic functions higher ordered abilities language constructional ability abstract thinking layered
testing attention refined consideration state wakefulness level consciousness
ideal test attentiveness assay concentration simple task placing minimal demand language function motor response spatial conception
reaction times frequently slowed patients diminished attentiveness
may become evident early course examination provide important clue examiner dealing decreased attentiveness
one test often recommended ability listen digit spans increasing length repeal back examiner
another patient listen digit span repeat backward
perhaps better test patient listen string letters one letter repeated frequently randomly tap time letter heard example please tap time hear letter k
l k b k n z k k k g b h w k l k
number errors patient makes noted
another test might patient count number times given letter appears page full randomly ordered letters
left perisylvian cortex mediates aspects language function right handed individuals half left handed individuals
thus aphasia implies damage left hemisphere time
basic examination language function include assessment spontaneous speech comprehension spoken commands reading ability reading comprehension writing repetition
assessment spontaneous speech performed patient supplies answers open ended questions
evaluation one looks disorders articulation abnormalities content disorders output paraphasic errors
phonemic errors mistakes pronunciation semantic errors errors meaning words neologisms meaningless nonwords specific meaning patient
repetition tested patient repeat sentences several nouns pronouns example said yesterday ifs ands buts
comprehension tested several levels responses
first patient asked complex yes questions take clothes taking shower
thereby minimizing need motoric speech acts
second questions gesture alone adequate response asked example point people may sit room
finally patient asked follow command motor response squeeze fingers
word finding disability may suspected spontaneous speech halting nature patient searches proper word
test ability patient asked name number objects several categories ranging everyday unusual
stress ability naming parts objects example crystal watch lead pencil also tested
word fluency specifically tested patient generate many words given category able fixed time period
standard tests ask things items found supermarket words beginning letters f
reading tested patient read loud listening errors testing reading comprehension patient follow written command example close eyes
standardized short stories available patients asked read later recall
scored remembrance key items
writing tested patient sign name generate spontaneous sentences describe object writing
memory disturbance common complaint often presenting symptom elderly
memory grouped simplistically three subunits immediate recall short term memory long term storage
short term memory clinically pertinent important tested
short term retention requires patient process store information move second intellectual task call remembrance completion second task
short term memory may tested patient learn four unrelated objects concepts short sentence five component name address asking patient recall information minutes performing second unrelated mental task
orientation largely reflects recent memory function
questions right
city
today date
time right nearest hour
pertinent questions
immediate recall tested patient repeal digit spans forward backward
long term memory tested patient ability recall remote personal historic events e g naming previous presidents major wars date bombing pearl harbor answer select questions wais information subtest
obviously asking remote personal events physician must privy accurate information judge accuracy patient response
apraxia inability due weakness perform previously learned motor acts
common ideomotor apraxias wherein patient initiate movements manipulation objects unable pretend given action
modality tested asking patient sew imaginary button use imaginary scissors light imaginary cigarette
ideatory apraxia breakdown higher ordered sequencing steps manipulation real objects
tested serial step commands example take piece paper left hand fold place envelope seal envelope
constructional inability loss capacity generate line drawings manipulate block designs verbal command visual reproduction
geschwind pointed older term constructional apraxia insufficient describe ability involves integration occipital parietal frontal lobe functions therefore complex word praxis would indicate
patient tested shown line drawings increasing complexity asked reproduce
next patient asked generate pictures memory example draw clock face put numbers draw hands clock say
finally patient may asked manipulate blocks multicolored cubes wais r reproduce stimulus designs
insight judgment manipulation knowledge solve problems forms abstract thinking tested crudely clinic laboratory
abilities perhaps best assessed probing patient functions job community affairs social situations proxy interview well patient interview
elements formally tested patient perform calculations complex well rote tables interpret proverbs describe similarities ordered pairs example tree like banana
praise similar criticism

complete mental status testing allows localizing potential sensitivity changes time mental status exams strub black mattis commended reader
one thinks standard neurologic examination largely devoted testing thresholds perception special senses integrity motor extrapyramidal systems
terms cerebral cortex neurologic examination concerns mainly narrow motor sensory strips around central sulcus rolando
large portions neocortex removed primary motor sensory strips mediate sensory input formulate response
association areas cortex especially include frontal temporoparietal inferior temporal parieto occipital regions brain
attentiveness requires intact brainstem cortical functioning
ascending reticular activating system extending midbrain hypothalamus thalamus profoundly influences arousal
substantive damage neocortex may likewise effect arousal
inattentiveness often seen effective disorders depression postulated secondary dysfunction ascending biogenic amine pathways
dysfunction may etiologic dementia syndrome depression
condition inattentiveness little differentiate toxic metabolic states diffuse cortical dysfunction psychiatric dysfunction
case however laterality inattentiveness
instances unilateral spatial neglect usually imply destructive lesion contralateral parietal lobe
left perisylvian cortex receiving vascular supply left middle cerebral artery mediates aspects language function individuals
lesion within region results defective language performance
works paul broca carl wernicke late earliest identify specialized functions different areas neocortex
lesions left side frontal lobe near face area motor cortex broca area lead disruption ability perform speech acts
speech patients lesions labored slow often ungrammatic often displaying impaired articulation
resultant speech pattern described telegraphic
comprehension however remains intact
damage superior portion temporal lobe near angular gyrus leads fluent speech may grammatically correct sound phonetically normal either semantically empty overtly nonsensical wernicke aphasia
thus earliest models language function postulated coordinated programs performing speech acts lay within broca area seat language comprehension lay within wernicke area
later refinements theory language function lay elucidation adjacent cortical association areas interconnections
norman geschwind developed excellent operational classification aphasias based hypothesized connections receptive cortical areas associative areas
example destruction arcuate fasciculus connection allowing conduction wernicke broca areas leads speech disorder may fluent wernicke like relatively good comprehension severely impaired repetition
called conduction aphasia
angular gyrus seems mediate visual auditory centers brain lesions effect disconnecting auditory written language
patients may speak understand speech understand written language
classifications lesions cortical areas well subcortical structures result language disorders subtle strict loss comprehension loss ability perform speech acts
lesions may affect normal pitch cadence speech destroy subtleties full comprehension appreciation irony sarcasm humor
termed transcortical aphasias
aphasic patients exhibit defect word finding difficulty exhibit circumlocution inability name objects parts objects
spontaneous speech fluent grammatic many word finding pauses
called anomic aphasia seen lesions many parts dominant hemisphere probably reflects either damage patchy loss patient internal lexicon semantic memory difficulty accessing semantic memory
memory little understood function unsolved puzzle neuroscience faculty imparting wonderment artists philosophers alike
ethereal term refer consciousness philosophically speaking probably resides immediate memory
character fanny jane austen mansfield park reflects upon faculty
one faculty nature may called wonderful rest think memory
seems something speakingly incomprehensible powers failures inequalities memory intelligences
memory sometimes retentive serviceable obedient others bewildered weak others tyrannic beyond control
sure miracle every way powers recollecting forgetting seem peculiarly past finding
finally memory ability many people equate intellectual prowess
wonder memory disturbance one distressing symptoms patient may present
amnestic syndrome produced bilateral damage limbic system hippocampus mamillary bodies anterior thalamus
disorder seen korsakoffs psychosis bilateral hippocampal infarction herpes simplex encephalitis results dramatic loss short term retention extreme total inability lay long term memory traces
cortical lesions dominant hemisphere tend result impairment verbal retention nondominant hemispheric lesions projections hippocampi result nonverbal retention deficits
thus demonstration differential verbal versus nonverbal memory ability localizing potential
primary degenerative dementias alzheimer parkinson pick result complex anatomic neurochemical disturbances affect much neocortical mantle
memory disturbance prominent early symptom resulting first defective short term memory followed retrograde loss remote memory
key clinical issue differentiation pathologic dementia age related benign forgetfulness
historic features suggesting early dementia would memory loss sufficient interfere work recreation community affairs ability carry activities daily living
memory dysfunction worsens matter months tends pathologic
