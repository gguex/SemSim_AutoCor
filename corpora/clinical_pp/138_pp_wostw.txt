gland elaborates two major hormones thyroxine triiodothyronine molar ratio approximately
major thyromimetic activity belongs monodeiodinated product
latter compound may function mainly prohormone whether intrinsic activity remains controversial
released gland arid circulate serum bound large part proteins thyroid binding globulin tbg prealbumin albumin
bound evidence date suggests free hormone biologically available portion
delivered target tissue apparently enters cell deiodinated translocates cell nucleus binds endogenous proteinaceous receptors
nature receptors recently elucidated
apparently encoded isoforms c erb proto oncogene related nuclear receptors steroid hormones retinoic acid
interaction cell nucleus thyroid hormone important regulator protein synthesis may direct actions mitochondrion plasma membrane
one important effect thyroid hormone stimulate cellular respiration process apparently derives induction na k atpase sodium pump
major determinant thyroid gland function thyrotropin tsh glycoprotein synthesized released thyrotropic cells anterior pituitary
tsh regulated turn hypothalamus elaboration thyrotropin releasing hormone trh tripeptide
tsh stimulates thyroid gland increase iodine uptake thyroid hormone synthesis release
thyroid hormone feeds back pituitary provides negative modulation tsh production
enlargement thyroid commonly results increased pituitary secretion tsh lymphocyte production tsh like immunoglobulins
addition number inflammatory infiltrative neoplastic diseases cause goiter
physical examination enables clinician differentiate among possibilities
pituitary commonly secretes excess amount tsh compensate deficiency thyroid hormone biosynthesis
initially tsh causes symmetrical enlargement thyroid gland
time gland become asymmetrical multinodular
dominant nodule multinodular gland resemble neoplastic process
immunoglobulins mimic tsh stimulation also cause symmetrical goiter hormone biosynthesis defective thyrotoxicosis result
