examiner ability help patient clarify elaborate ocular symptom examiner knowledge significance common ocular symptoms often facilitate correct diagnosis basis history alone
patient complains eye pain chapter essential describe ocular discomfort clearly
examiner must differentiate itching tearing burning foreign body sensation photophobia deep pain pain eye movement tenderness touch
frequently patient one type symptom examiner must ask part eye problem disturbing
itching lids conjunctiva fairly specific symptom may associated surface allergy hay fever forms type immediate hypersensitivity
burning external ocular symptom occurs commonly conjunctivitis
foreign body sensation specific occurs break corneal epithelium exposing sensitive corneal nerves opening closing eyelids e g corneal abrasion
contrast photophobia painful spasm exposure bright light often accompanies intraocular inflammation therefore separated mundane complaints burning
asking patient whether headache around eye worse bright light often clarify complaint photophobia
deep pain discomfort eye movements rather specific symptom associated retrobulbar neuritis due proximity extraocular muscles inflamed optic nerve
tenderness touch uncommon ophthalmic symptom may seen episcleritis scleritis
acute decrease visual acuity chapter alarming symptom patient examiner
simple questions often help diagnostic thought process
acute loss vision usually one eye
older patient common causes include retinal vascular disease acute ischemic optic neuropathy latter sometimes associated temporal arteritis
younger patient unilateral central visual loss may associated retrobulbar neuritis deep pain eye movements supporting diagnosis
visual loss associated flashes light photopsia floaters make one think retinal detachment
diabetic sudden unilateral visual loss often vitreous hemorrhage due proliferative retinopathy
reversible central visual loss seen amaurosis fugax occasionally migraine
former visual loss nearly complete one eye signaled sensation drawing curtain restoration acuity always occurring within several minutes
migraine may start central scintillation distortion spreading periphery visual often followed typical migraine headache
gradually occurring painless loss vision seen commonly cataracts advanced glaucoma retinopathy especially degenerative retinopathy elderly
diplopia double vision chapter highly significant symptom frequently signifying presence neurologic disease must separated symptoms represent diplopia
one must establish patient truly means double vision rather blurred vision
one may ask things seem blurry look across room really see two everything
answer question yes next step eliminate rare possibility monocular diplopia
simply tell patient cover one eye ask whether double vision goes away
occlusion one eye relieves double vision one established true diplopia
one asks whether two images seen side side vertically displaced
far common answer horizontal displacement
acute setting usually implies dysfunction either medial rectus muscle cranial nerve iii lateral rectus muscle cranial nerve vi
double vision worse looking distant objects nearby objects difficulty divergence suggested making sixth nerve paresis likely
conversely greater horizontal diplopia near distance represents difficulty convergence third nerve paresis medial rectus likely
finally variability diplopia increasing fatigue toward end day highly suggestive myasthenia gravis
visual disturbances may reported
blurred vision frequent complaint diabetics recent episodes elevation blood glucose caused reversible osmotic swelling crystalline lens
floaters extremely common represent minute opacities suspended posterior aspect vitreous gel
photopsia visual sensation seeing tiny flashes light usually caused mechanical traction retina often seen retinal detachment
light scintillation visual disturbance metamorphopsia alteration form may precede migrainous headaches although metamorphopsia alone may associated swelling deformation retina
table
lists equipment used examining eye
general inspection eyes adnexa discussed chapter
important get overview patient
especially true patient external ocular complaints
specifically eyes eyelids inflamed general pattern inflammation described
pale boggy swelling four eyelids certainly seen classic allergic reactions eczematous changes lower eyelids associated hypersensitivity topical medications
external inflammation present means palpate preauricular submandibular nodes enlarge viral conjunctivitis parinaud oculoglandular syndrome
finally one eye prominent proptotic
central visual acuity chapter vital sign ophthalmic examination
documentation good visual acuity eye establishes presence near normal refraction clear ocular media good retinal function intact afferent neuropathways cortical functioning
use eye chart feet certainly appropriate clinical settings
even bedside however hand held visual acuity card small newsprint used estimate patient visual acuity
essential measuring visual acuity neat distances patients older years age reading glasses customarily used worn
testing visual fields chapter confrontation detect conditions affecting optic chiasm tracts visual cortex
patient instructed cover one eye look directly examiner eye figure
simultaneously examiner make small hand movements periphery visual field telling patient say first awareness movement
confrontation testing one concerned likely find dense visual field loss seen cortical chiasmal lesions
proper alignment eyes extraocular motility easily ascertained brief examination
penlight held inches cm patient eyes aimed directly pupils patient looking light figure
resultant light reflex relative position corneas
examiner uses hand immobilize patient head tells patient follow penlight
examiner moves penlight horizontal extremes well upward downward observing appropriate movement patient eyes
corneal reflex remain symmetrical eyes move patient continue see one light throughout examination
examine pupils level ambient light reduced relax accommodation patient directed look distant object
using penlight directed barely illuminating pupils one inspects symmetry pupillary size
patient continues view distant object pupil tested separately constriction response bright light
penlight quickly moved one pupil shining light directly eye swinging penlight test elicit afferent pupillary defect test one specifically looking pupil dilates light first directed toward demonstrating greater consensual direct response
afferent pupillary defect also known marcus gunn pupil
discrepancy mm pupillary size found pupils measured bright reduced ambient light
differences pupillary size aniso coria tend physiologic pathologic differences mm remain differing levels ambient light
penlight used examine anterior segment eye namely cornea anterior chamber iris pupil
cornea generally crystal clear opacities without inflammation usually represent old scars
anterior segment appreciated three dimensional structure especially viewed side
cornea domed convexity iris pupil single plane several millimeters posterior apex cornea
patients three dimensionality anterior segment easily observed
shallow anterior chamber e predisposition acute angle closure glaucoma suspected iris pupil appear painted back cornea
loss three dimensionality often identifies shallow anterior chamber patient configuration dilated pharmacologically
irregularity pupillary shape usually result previous inflammation surgery described
fundus examination chapter patient directed look straight ahead distant object
ophthalmoscope turned brightest illumination smaller aperture used patient undilated patient approached degrees temporally ophthalmoscope set zero figure
helpful tell patient even though right front please make believe see continue looking object end room
examiner puts ophthalmoscope right eye examine patient right eye approaching degrees temporally
ophthalmoscope approaches patient eye one observes blood vessels optic disk come view
optimal distance patient cornea ophthalmoscope
cm less best maintained wrapping one forefinger around ophthalmoscope resting finger ophthalmoscope patient cheek stabilize viewing arrangement
soon retinal blood vessel disk comes view focusing wheel ophthalmoscope moved one way achieve clearest image
retinal vessel found first one searches vascular bifurcation showing way optic disk e vessels bifurcate course away disk toward retinal periphery
disk view one inspects center outward
first identify borders optic cup proportion horizontal diameter total diameter disk cupdisk ratio
substance disk examined sure pink healthy margins clear sharp
subtle undulation caliber light reflex retinal venules adjacent optic disk represents venous pulsation normal occurs heartbeat recorded present
venules somewhat darker larger caliber arterioles
normal arteriole venule diameter ratio
decreases ratio seen arteriolosclerosis associated hypertension
posterior pole retina examined systematically
first one follows superonasal arteriole venule leaving disk far periphery possible
repeated inferonasal vessels inferotemporal vessels superotemporal vessels
finally fovea visualized directing attention several disk diameters temporal disk slightly inferiorly
maneuver saved last sensitive portion retina bright light
foveal reflex seen often slightly yellowish surrounding area macula lutea
identical procedure carried patient left eye using left eye viewing
