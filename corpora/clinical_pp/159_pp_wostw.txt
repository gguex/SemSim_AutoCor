rheumatic symptoms rheumatism distinguished following seven characteristics pain discomfort usually perceived vicinity one joints including spine pain motion affected areas soreness touch affected regions stiffness affected parts especially period immobility symptomatic improvement mild exercise worsening vigorous exercise symptomatic worsening response climatic factors especially falling barometric pressure rising humidity symptomatic improvement response warming affected areas
rheumatic pain syndromes seven characteristics least first four
history rheumatism foundation rheumatic disease histories least classify symptom complex fully explored may lead precise diagnosis
basic rheumatic history differ fundamentally medical histories approached according seven dimensions symptom outlined morgan engel
rheumatic pain almost always localized see tables
specific syndromes
may localized one region body e g one shoulder girdle single structure multiple sites e g peripheral joints
viewpoint specific diagnosis important aspect musculoskeletal history process localizing symptoms
best done asking patient show exactly hurts
unusually large ill defined area indicated patient helpful inquire pain seem center
times physician might help hesitant patient lightly palpating region question
symptoms adequately localized patterns radiation determined
certain areas discomfort reported
viewpoint classification rheumatism important dimension rheumatic disease history concerns factors aggravate alleviate symptoms
influences motion immobility across affected parts explored
gentle motion affected part would expected increase discomfort motion might result symptomatic improvement motion ceased vigorous exercise worsen pain activity
long periods immobility especially sleep typically result symptom stiffness term readily understood patients rheumatic pain syndrome
fact patient seems understand question stiff morning
probably worth pursuing line questioning
approach influence climatic factors open ended question sensitive changes weather
specifics determined
patients chronic rheumatic pain syndrome learned heat helpful readily respond question concerning influence local heat applications
feel better hot bath
might asked intentionally applied heat painful region
responses drug therapies also determined part interview might terminated open ended question concerning maneuvers patient noted influence symptoms
quality rheumatic pain typically deep aching sensation word soreness also used perhaps emphasize pain motion tenderness touch
question pain feel like
usually suffice cover dimension soreness touch asked volunteered patient
quantity severity rheumatic pain varies widely patient patient time time one patient
except extremely aggravating circumstances generally less severe ischemic neuropathic visceral pain
unexplained fluctuations days weeks months typical rheumatic pain patient asked pattern changing severity
patients frequent fluctuations severity difficulty concepts overall improvement overall worsening
often helpful ask think terms average severity period month compared say december bad pain june
major indicator severity rheumatic syndrome disability
physical social occupational restrictions imposed problem explored detail
chronology rheumatic pain syndrome often helps suggest precise diagnosis however rheumatic pain general may begin insidiously abruptly persist days indefinitely
definitive diagnosis mind time nature onset subsequent overall disease behavior determined
change location character symptoms time noted
major medical interventions might detailed aspect interview
setting rheumatic pain syndrome develops may also point toward specific diagnosis
age sex patient especially important
spondyloarthropathies tend occur young men systemic lupus erythematosus occurs young women rheumatoid arthritis tends begin middle aged women
interviewer develop clear picture patient physical activities antedating onset symptoms patterns might considered unusual fully explored
antecedent musculoskeletal trauma overlooked
final dimension rheumatic pain symptom complex associated manifestations
characteristically absent problem regional characteristically protean many diseases associated polyarthralgia
latter group disorders common important associated manifestations listed table
patients rheumatic symptoms however open ended questions address dimension
would feel well normal pain stiffness would go away
useful purpose
causes rheumatic pain syndromes listed table
diverse nature nonarticular disorders seem induced wear tear sustained use part question
scientific studies inquired origins tendinitis bursitis enthesopathies myofascial pain clinical observations suggest important role repetitive motion sustained muscle contraction
repetitive motion fray tendon moves bony prominence produce sufficient damage result inflammatory focus
bursae occur sites friction may irritated similar fashion
sustained muscle contraction may result ischemic foci muscle belly near attachment resulting tender areas called myofascial trigger points
number observations suggest inflammation enthesis result local ischemia due sustained contraction muscle
rheumatic pain syndromes induced precipitated certain patterns musculoskeletal usage
pathogenesis rheumatic pain syndromes addressed briefly table
scientific evidence associate myofascial pain inflammatory response otherwise acute chronic inflammatory process plays important pathogenetic role remainder
inflammation whether initiated known unknown causes primary event arthropathies except osteoarthritis
even osteoarthritis secondary inflammatory process important production many symptoms
especially case inflamed synovial structures joints bursae tendon sheaths patient likely aware inflammatory process
consequently may possible obtain history local swelling warmth redness well pain tenderness
clinical significance rheumatism traverses spectrum trivial expected discomfort serious disabling life threatening disease
patients seek medical attention local regional nonarticular rheumatic symptoms benign self limited disorder whereas significant number perhaps majority see physician generalized joint symptoms potentially serious disabling disease
