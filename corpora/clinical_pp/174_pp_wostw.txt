galactorrhea nonpuerperal lactation usually results multiple duct discharge breasts
etiology galactorrhea classified terms prolactin abnormalities
galactorrhea associated high prolactins caused failure normal hypothalamic inhibition prolactin release enhanced prolactin releasing factor autonomous ectopic prolactin releasing factor
lesions hypothalamus pituitary stalk section drugs influence central nervous system decrease inhibitory dopaminergic control prolactin
common drugs interfering prolactin inhibition psychotropic drugs butyrophenones phenothiazines antihypertensives reserpine alpha methyldopa cannabinoids opiates marijuana morphine heroin contraceptives metoclopropamide
physiologic enhancement prolactin release caused thyrotropin releasing hormone trh
primary hypothyroidism resulting increases trh cause prolactin release galactorrhea cured thyroid hormone replacement
three types pituitary tumors may associated galactorrhea pure prolactin secreting tumors micro macroadenoma mixed tumors secrete growth hormone prolactin chromophobe adenomas
prolactin also rarely secreted malignancies bronchogenic carcinoma hydatidiform moles chorio carcinomas hypernephromas
majority patients galactorrhea normal prolactins
series women galactorrhea idiopathic galactorrhea normal prolactins
irritative nipple stimulation breast manipulation cause galactorrhea mildly elevated normal prolactins
one third normal nonpostpartum women raise serum prolactin repetitive breast stimulation
postpartum women lactate normal ovulatory function one years following pregnancy especially breast manipulation
duct ectasia comedomastitis produce multicolored sticky discharge commonly bilateral perimenopausal woman
begins dilation terminal ducts irritating lipid fluid collecting producing inflammatory reaction resulting discharge nipple
duct ectasia frequently associated pain itching swelling nipple
palpation areola often reveal tubular mass reflecting dilated ducts

disease progresses mass develop plasma cell mastitis mimic cancer
surgery indicated mass forms discharge changes serosanguinous bloody
patients acute puerperal mastitis chronic lactation mastitis central breast abscesses plasma cell mastitis pus discharged usually unilaterally
breast cultures smears may reveal organism responsible
abscess formation usually requires incision drainage appropriate antibiotics local soaks effect
important remove portion abscess wall histologic study rule possibility underlying cancer secondary necrosis infection
