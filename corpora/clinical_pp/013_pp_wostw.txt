cardiovascular history obtained identify evidence organic heart disease symptoms suggest presence possible presence cardiovascular abnormalities
accurate history taking acquired skill perfected experience
details history may vary according physical emotional status patient educational cultural economic background manner questions asked
direct questioning questioning family members spouse review medical records may required
open ended questions asked time allowed listening entire answer
leading questions avoided
patients often learn use terms heard previous interviews question describe chest discomfort frequently yield useful information chest pain dull squeezing sensation
following areas explored thoroughly
patient ever told heart problem
obtain details regarding diagnosis made made diagnosed done
heart attack
term heart attack means different things different people
history heart attacks child ten heart attacks since viewed skepticism unless documentation obtained
today majority patients myocardial infarction experience hospital stay least week
patients state hospitalized day two discharged emergency room usually suffering acute infarction
documentation needed
coronary artery disease
details concerning diagnosis needed
valvular disease
history leaky valve mitral prolapse obtained frequently
patients told mitral prolapse based solely personality type symptoms usually chest pain palpitations systolic murmur frequently innocent flow murmur support diagnosis needed
heart murmur
age murmur first discovered important piece historical data
addition history physical restrictions placed patient time diagnosis sought
rheumatic fever
frequently misused diagnosis must interpreted caution
details illness must explored
many patients state parents told rheumatic fever give history fever sore throat heart murmur
enlarged heart
usually radiologic diagnosis extremely nonspecific
since enlarged heart mean dilatation hypertrophy poor x ray technique history limited value
heart failure
commonly history shortness breath exertion especially elderly translated due congestive heart failure
congestive failure symptom complex similar fever true diagnosis claim must investigated
ectopy
patient told extra skipped heartbeats
basis irregular pulse often misleading egg
hypertension
patient history high blood pressure
diagnosed
medications prescribed
history heart surgery
sure look appropriate surgical scars physical examination
similarly patient denies heart surgery thoracotomy scar found surgery performed
history vascular disease
association peripheral artery coronary artery disease helpful
since many adults complain cold feet poor circulation leg cramps symptoms alone confirm diagnosis
patient ever tests performed heart evaluate heart electrocardiogram echocardiogram hour holler monitor treadmill exercise tests cardiac catheterization
better describe procedure lay terms rather use words echo cath may understood
also patient may similar procedure e g aortography abdominal ultrasound may realize tests evaluate cardiac structures
patient ever failed military job physical denied insurance medical reasons
medication history
important know medicines taken taken
diuretics prescribed variety reasons many patients know exactly taking particular drug
also one aware hidden medications
example many women consider birth control pills medication mention unless specifically asked
history previous hospitalizations patient spend time intensive care unit icu cardiac care unit ccu
many adults especially elderly cardiovascular disease start sudden significant decompensation
careful history reveal past evidence cardiac problems
following areas reviewed
growth development history obtained
patient healthy child
able keep siblings peers
active sports physically demanding activities
women pregnancy history including problems gestation childbirth important
patients review previous cardiovascular symptoms made include history chest pain pqrst approach degowin degowin good one shortness breath rest exertion orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea edema palpitations dizziness vertigo loss consciousness fatigue nocturia claudication cyanosis cough
patient history diseases conditions known affect cardiovascular system
list conditions long involve multiple organ systems
good starting point new york heart association list etiologies cardiovascular disease
search cardiac risk factors also appropriately incorporated past history
patient ever told high low blood sugar
latter risk factor suggests blood glucose may drawn past
patient high cholesterol triglycerides high low blood pressure
patient smoked chewed tobacco used snuff past
parenteral drugs legal illegal
patient overweight
obtaining past history one must able correlate said known anatomic physiologic hemodynamic electrical properties heart
example definition myocardial infarction includes necrosis tissue hence history seven heart attacks year patient appears clinically asymptomatic must accepted caution
similarly atherosclerosis generally progressive would unusual someone severe disabling angina pectoris years without suffered major cardiac event although coronary artery spasm result prolonged symptoms without causing myocardial infarction
another example would history sudden death
patients suffered cardiac arrest require resuscitative efforts recovery
patients state told died give history efforts made save
said careful history physical examination lead correct diagnosis majority patients
certainly true past history area frequently overlooked house officers especially tense atmosphere acute illness
physician must use considerable skill obtaining accurate historical account
today average patient exposed wealth medical information
accurate inaccurate descriptions heart attacks strokes cancer forth seen daily television films people familiar reye syndrome migraine headaches
addition general population become concerned health especially area cardiovascular disease
although symptoms confined area larynx umbilicus cardiac origin heart patient mind organ prime concern
relating past history many adults describe events told parents relatives friends physicians
classic example patient states mother told never take penicillin reason restriction known
febrile illness accompanied systolic murmur becomes rheumatic fever especially illness occurred era disease common
rheumatic fever becomes translated rheumatic heart disease patient years later complains fatigue
patients history shortness breath swelling lower extremities may acquired label congestive heart failure may placed digitalis preparation
past history cardiovascular disease extremely important part patient evaluation dismissed noncontributory
patient presents emergency room atypical chest pain previous cardiovascular problems evaluations could mean difference outpatient clinic appointment admission ccu
history previous cardiac procedures results obtained may avoid unnecessary repeat testing reduce hospital clinic costs
patient acute distress one hesitate postpone detailed history stable
house officers often reluctant go back patient official admitting history physical written
repeat questioning patient longer pain respiratory distress lead appropriate care avoid embarrassing moments following morning attending rounds
finally one must remember constructive skepticism necessary history taking cynicism counterproductive
whether patient calls heart attack indigestion chest pain smothering gas symptoms real must included evaluation
physician patient attach correct diagnostic label
