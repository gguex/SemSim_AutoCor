inspection consists visual examination abdomen note made shape abdomen skin abnormalities abdominal masses movement abdominal wall respiration
abnormalities detected inspection provide clues intra abdominal pathology investigated auscultation palpation
auscultation abdomen performed detection altered bowel sounds rubs vascular bruits
normal peristalsis creates bowel sounds may altered absent disease
irritation serosal surfaces may produce sound rub organ moves serosal surface
atherosclerosis may alter arterial blood flow bruit produced
palpation examination abdomen crepitus abdominal wall abdominal tenderness abdominal masses
liver kidneys may palpable normal individuals masses abnormal
abdomen inspected positioning patient supine examining table bed
head knees supported small pillows folded sheets comfort relax abdominal wall musculature
entire abdominal wall must examined drapes positioned accordingly
patient arms sides folded behind head tenses abdominal wall
good lighting essential helpful tangential lighting available create subtle shadows abdominal wall masses
first general contour entire abdominal wall observed
contour checked carefully distention note made whether distention generalized localized portion abdomen
similarly flanks checked bulging
abdominal wall skin inspected carefully abnormalities
areas discoloration noted bluish discoloration umbilicus cullen sign flanks grey turner sign
skin inspected striae stretch marks surgical scars
careful note surgical scars made correlated patient recollection previous operations
skin abdomen also checked carefully engorged veins abdominal wall direction blood flow veins
performed placing tips index fingers together compressing visible vein
fingertips slid apart maintaining compression producing empty venous segment fingers
finger removed one end vein watched filling
procedure repeated opposite finger removed vein checked filling
umbilicus blood flow normally upward umbilicus normally downward
obstruction inferior vena cava cause reversal flow lower abdomen
addition large dilated veins note made spider angiomas abdominal wall skin
next abdomen inspected masses
performed several angles
important differentiate abdominal wall intra abdominal masses
mass abdominal wall become prominent tensing abdominal wall musculature whereas intra abdominal mass become less prominent disappear
useful maneuvers patient hold head unsupported examining table hold nose blow raise feet table
abdominal wall masses commonly hernias either umbilical epigastric incisional spigelian neoplasms benign malignant infections hematomas
mass determined intra abdominal location described relation abdominal quadrants figure
relationship intra abdominal organs quadrants considered attempting determine cause mass
mass examined movement respiration pulsation heartbeat
also mass observed peristalsis may well represent dilated bowel
lastly abdominal wall observed motion respiration
normally abdominal wall moves posteriorly symmetrical fashion inspiration
peritonitis may localized generalized rigidity abdominal wall motion absent
patient positioned comfortably supine position described inspection
stethoscope used listen several areas abdomen several minutes presence bowel sounds
diaphragm stethoscope applied abdominal wall firm gentle pressure
often helpful warm diaphragm examiner hands application particularly ticklish patients
bowel sounds present one listen full minutes determining bowel sounds fact absent
auscultation abdominal bruits next phase abdominal examination
bruits swishing sounds heard major arteries systole less commonly systole diastole
area aorta renal arteries
iliac arteries examined carefully bruits
rubs infrequently found abdominal examination occur liver spleen abdominal mass
patient positioned supine head knees supported inspection auscultation
take history perform inspection auscultation palpation tends put patient ease increases cooperation
addition palpation may stimulate bowel activity thus falsely increase bowel sounds performed auscultation
ask patients abdominal pain point area greatest pain
reassure try minimize discomfort examine point last
palpating abdomen one first gently examine abdominal wall fingertips
demonstrate crunching feeling crepitus abdominal wall sign gas fluid within subcutaneous tissues
addition demonstrate irregularities abdominal wall lipomas hernias give idea areas tenderness
deep palpation abdomen performed placing flat hand abdominal wall applying firm steady pressure
may helpful use two handed palpation figure particularly evaluating mass
upper hand used exert pressure lower hand used feel
one start deep palpation quadrant directly opposite area pain carefully examine quadrant
costal margin helpful patient inspire deeply aid palpation liver gallbladder spleen
flanks often helpful elevate flank examined slightly place one hand lower ribs flank push retroperitoneal contents examining hand
way small renal masses would otherwise missed may appreciated
abdominal tenderness objective expression pain palpation
elicited described location quadrant depth palpation required elicit superficial deep patient response mild severe
spasm rigidity involuntary tightening abdominal musculature occurs response underlying inflammation
guarding contrast voluntary contraction abdominal wall musculature avoid pain
thus guarding tends generalized entire abdomen whereas rigidity involves inflamed area
guarding often overcome patient purposely relax muscles rigidity
rigidity thus clear cut sign peritoneal inflammation
rebound tenderness elicitation tenderness rapidly removing examining hand
difficult sign beginning examiner master
common error remove hand quickly exaggerated motion thus startle patient
needs done smoothly quickly lift palpating hand abdomen observe pain facial grimace spasm abdominal wall
tenderness rebound tenderness may elicited palpation different quadrant
thus palpation left lower quadrant may produce tenderness rebound tenderness right lower quadrant appendicitis rovsing sign
called referred tenderness referred rebound
abdominal masses palpated first consideration whether mass intra abdominal within abdominal wall
determined patient raise head feet examining table
tense abdominal muscles thus shielding intra abdominal mass making abdominal wall mass prominent
mass intra abdominal important points size location tenderness mobility
palpation percussion used evaluate ascites
rounded symmetrical contour abdomen bulging flanks often first clue
palpation abdomen patient ascites often demonstrate doughy almost fluctuant sensation
advanced cases abdominal wall tense due distention contained fluid
gas filled intestines float top fluid filled abdomen
thus supine patient ascites periumbilical tympany dullness flanks
one mark level dullness skin turn patient one side full minute
change level dullness termed shifting dullness usually indicates ml ascitic fluid
another physical sign ascites demonstration transmitted fluid wave
patient assistant presses hand firmly abdominal wall umbilical region
examiner places flat left hand right flank taps left flank right hand
presence ascites sharp tap generate pressure wave transmitted left hand
unfortunately fat also transmit fluid wave frequent false positives test
addition detection ascites percussion used help define nature abdominal mass
tympany abdominal mass implies gas filled e intestine
percussion also used define liver size
normal peristalsis intestine produces bowel sounds gas fluid passed intestinal lumen
normally bowel sounds intermittent low pitched chuckling sounds
bowel sounds may decreased increased disease states
ileus failure peristalsis normal physiologic response intestine laparotomy peritoneal inflammation
addition ileus seen number disease states affect peritoneum directly including pneumonia congestive heart failure uremia
bowel sounds markedly diminished absent ileus intestine distends gas paralyzed state
early mechanical bowel obstruction produces hyperactive peristaltic waves proximal mechanical obstruction
waves increased frequency force produce concomitant increase bowel sounds characteristic rushes
bowel gradually dilates gas fluid bowel sounds become high pitched tinkling may periods hypoactive bowel sounds alternate hyperperistaltic rushes
rushes correlate increased peristaltic activity
finally late intestinal obstruction may loss bowel sounds due loss peristaltic activity vascular compromise
vascular bruits audible manifestation turbulent blood flow
found normally thin patients heavier individuals muffled surrounding fat
loud systolic bruits due atherosclerotic plaques within arteries producing turbulent flow
plaques common aorta iliac arteries less common renal arteries
addition turbulent flow within abdominal aortic aneurysm may create bruit
bruits present systole diastole strongly suggestive arteriovenous communication
rubs uncommon abdominal auscultation found result inflamed peritoneal surfaces grating respiration
result neoplastic infectious process destroys normally smooth peritoneal surfaces
crepitus produced gas air andor fluid within tissues
abdominal wall either due traumatic introduction air secondary infection gas gangrene
subcutaneous emphysema occur rupture pulmonary bleb penetrating chest injury dissection air subcutaneous spaces
addition penetrating abdominal trauma may introduce enough air abdominal wall produce crepitus
gas gangrene occur complication intra abdominal surgery produce crepitus abdominal wall
gas produced anaerobic bacteria usually clostridia species specific clinical sign found patient wound infection
abdominal tenderness occurs result irritation parietal peritoneum
inflammation irritation visceral peritoneum cause abdominal discomfort anorexia poorly localized pain cause tenderness rigidity abdominal wall
irritation inflammation parietal peritoneum stimulate pain fibers parietal peritoneum abdominal wall creating symptoms localized pain signs tenderness rigidity rebound tenderness
thus diffuse irritation peritoneum diffuse peritonitis diffuse tenderness rigidity
abdominal masses arise surrounding structures thus importance topographic relationships
presence absence tenderness mass gives important information etiology
appendiceal abscess tender inflames parietal peritoneum whereas carcinoma cecum nontender inflammation involved
tympany mass implies gas filled
abdomen usually signifies mass dilated bowel rarely enough gas mass produce tympany
ascites presence intra abdominal fluid occurs overproduction intra abdominal fluid lack absorption
commonly seen cirrhosis increase portal pressure hypoalbuminemia
increased portal pressure hydrostatically increases transudation fluid capillaries whereas hypoalbuminemia hydrostatically favors ascites formation
thus accumulation fluid peritoneal space signifies severe liver disease
common causes ascites include carcinomatosis increase fluid formation difficulties clearing intraperitoneal fluid congestive heart failure hydrostatic increase venous pressure
inspection abdomen gives clues diagnosis intra abdominal pathology
combined patient history inspection often provide preliminary diagnosis confirmed auscultation palpation
despite current popularity various noninvasive invasive diagnostic tests experienced surgeon usually make accurate diagnosis intra abdominal pathology history physical examination
demonstrated patient several day history right upper quadrant back pain associated nausea vomiting fever visible mass right upper quadrant
patient almost certainly acute cholecystitis hydrops gallbladder
remainder physical examination merely confirms detects additional disease
though inspection alone never provides clear diagnosis overlooked
generalized distention abdomen usually obesity bowel distention gas liquid ascites
obesity cause generalized distension either fat abdominal wall intra abdominal fat omentum viscera
generalized abdominal distention also related ascites particularly associated everted umbilicus
distention upper half abdomen may due pancreatic cyst tumor acute gastric dilatation
distention lower half abdomen may due pregnancy ovarian tumor uterine fibroids bladder distention
scaphoid abdomen due malnutrition
skin abnormalities detected inspection abdominal wall need correlated clinical history
bruising correlated history trauma determine possible organs injured
cullen grey turner signs bluish discoloration umbilicus flanks respectively related intra abdominal retroperitoneal bleeding believed blood dissects along fascial planes reach areas
thus one would want question patient diligently causes bleedingsevere pancreatitis trauma ruptured ectopic pregnancy
striae abdominal wall result rupture reticular dermis occurs stretching
seen clinically pregnancy obesity ascites abdominal carcinomatosis cushing syndrome
surgical scars examined carefully position characteristics
often patients unsure kinds surgery position incision may give examiner clue
even though transverse right lower quadrant incision suggests appendectomy however way proves one must circumspect making assumptions
scar tells examiner surgery
scars initially raised red gradually fade pink months generally flat skin colored gray
wounds heal cleanly first intention thin regular whereas infected heal secondary intention wider irregular
keloids wide irregular scars abundant hypertrophic tissue outside field normal scarring
keloid formation tends recur certain individuals particularly common blacks
enlarged veins seen three clinical situations emaciation portal hypertension inferior vena cava obstruction
emaciation loss subcutaneous fat normally invisible veins become prominent
veins become prominent presence portal hypertension
portal hypertension umbilical vein becomes outflow tract portal system forms collaterals veins abdominal wall
responsible caput medusa diagnostic portal hypertension
direction blood flow veins portal hypertension normal e upward umbilicus downward blood flowing high pressure portal system low pressure systemic system
finally veins abdominal wall may dilated due obstruction inferior vena cava
occurs abdominal wall becomes collateral bypass around obstruction cava
situation direction blood flow reversed umbilicus blood flows femoral vein superior vena cava
obstruction inferior vena cava occur result hepatic malignancy extension hepatic vein obstruction budd chiari syndrome result thrombophlebitis result trauma surgical intervention
masses noted inspection abdomen may related organs area
thus mass right upper quadrant may represent hepatomegaly hepatitis hepatic tumor distended gallbladder cholecystitis pancreatic cancer carcinoma head pancreas
epigastric mass likely acute gastric distention
pancreatic pseudocyst pancreatic cancer aneurysm abdominal aorta pulsatile
masses left subcostal region generally due splenomegaly although carcinoma spenic flexure colon also possibility
masses lumbar region generally renal origin
renal cysts polycystic kidneys renal malignancies may visible asthenic patients
masses lower quadrants may result inflammatory neoplastic disorders intestine
right lower quadrant appendiceal abscess cecal carcinoma likely left lower quadrant diverticular abscess carcinoma sigmoid colon likely
hypogastric masses result pelvic pathology
acute urinary retention common cause mass males
females uterine ovarian neoplasms may cause visible midline abdominal masses
visible intestinal peristalsis usually result intestinal obstruction
seen stomach newborn hypertrophic pyloric stenosis small intestine patients small bowel obstruction various etiologies
bowel sounds significance clinician marker intra abdominal pathology
absence bowel sounds may one indicators intra abdominal infection patients multiple problems particularly altered mental status
patients generalized abdominal distention following laparotomy bowel sounds may key diagnostic finding differentiate ileus early postoperative small bowel obstruction
though radiographic examination abdomen may suggest bowel obstruction characteristic high pitched bowel sounds diagnostic experienced clinician
similarily vascular bruits helpful clinician indicator underlying pathology
thus carefully searched patients hypertension renal artery stenosis chronic abdominal pain mesenteric arterial insufficiency claudication occlusive disease aorta iliac arteries
continuous bruits caused arteriovenous fistulas searched carefully patients penetrating abdominal trauma
abdominal rubs rare may found liver spleen
rub implies surface organ irregular usually due involvement tumor abscess infarction
rarely inflammatory intra abdominal mass may associated rub caused irritation adjacent abdominal wall
mentioned previously abdominal tenderness difficult physical finding master
nevertheless finding must mastered often clear finding peritonitis may well determine therapy
classic example appendicitis
history laboratory findings may suggest appendicitis patient abdominal pain presence absence tenderness makes breaks diagnosis
laboratory studies either exclude ensure diagnosis appendicitis clinician must make therapeutic decisions based physical finding tenderness
tenderness caused inflammation parietal peritoneum etiology tenderness related underlying organs
thus right upper quadrant tenderness may caused cholecystitis ulcer disease pancreatitis hepatitis
epigastric tenderness usually due pancreatitis peptic ulcer disease
right lower quadrant tenderness may related appendicitis cecal diverticulitis perforated carcinoma whereas left lower quadrant tenderness usually due sigmoid diverticulitis
flank tenderness usually related renal pathology either pyelonephritis perinephric abscess
tenderness generalized one must consider causes generalized peritonitis
acute perforated ulcer frequent cause presents characteristic boardlike rigidity abdominal wall
common causes include perforated diverticulitis perforated appendicitis pancreatitis
nevertheless process produces generalized peritoneal irritation chemical infectious produce physical findings
abdominal masses related underlying organs
right upper quadrant masses include hepatomegaly hydrops gallbladder carcinoma head pancreas
epigastric masses pancreatic pseudocyst carcinoma gastric malignancies colon malignancies
masses left upper quadrant usually due either splenomegaly carcinoma stomach colon
flanks masses usually arise kidney cyst tumor although occasionally retroperitoneal structures lymphoma sarcoma
masses lower quadrants usually arise bowel
right side common masses include appendiceal abscess cecal carcinoma left diverticular abscess sigmoid carcinoma
central abdominal masses often aortic aneurysms pulsatile nature mass diagnostic
thus evaluating abdominal mass one must consider location mobility presence absence tenderness order define etiology
clinical significance ascites based largely etiology
often determined history physical examination paracentesis diagnostic
samples peritoneal fluid sent laboratory protein concentration specific gravity cell counts culture
exudative ascites occurs bacterial peritonitis carcinomatosis pancreatic ascites associated protein concentration gmdl specific gravity
transudative ascites occurs cirrhosis budd chiari syndrome constrictive pericarditis congestive heart failure hypoalbuminemic disorders nephrotic syndrome
incidences protein concentration less gmdl specific gravity less
