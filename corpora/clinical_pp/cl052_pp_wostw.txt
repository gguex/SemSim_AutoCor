muscle cramp denotes episodic involuntary painful contraction muscle
muscle spasm encompassing term referring involuntary muscle contraction
muscle cramps ubiquitous yet tend little benign nuisance sufferer
occasion though physician encounters either patients complain cramps might want inquire presence evaluating related symptom
nothing unique taking history cramps aims characterize complaint fully extract clues might reveal cause
accomplished patient describe symptom asking directed questions necessary elaborate information quality location duration precipitating relieving maneuvers course symptom associated features
many patients complain cramps actually related phenomenon
characteristics helpful making correct diagnosis
quality
useful find onset abrupt slow sensation painful
stiff appearance abnormal posture described patient demonstrate
true cramps onset sudden muscle feels taut painful usually visibly palpably knotted although may readily apparent part muscle involved
location
determine muscles involved singly groups certain muscles consistently involved cramps remain limited spread
ordinary cramps often affect leg especially calf muscles locations may point specific syndrome carpopedal spasms tetany unilateral facial involvement hemifacial spasms
duration
ordinary cramps last seconds several minutes severe
fleeting twitches prolonged contractions suggest another type disorder
precipitating relieving maneuvers
attempt uncover relation exercise specifically find occurrence rest exercise also duration intensity exercise may initiate cramps
moreover clarify cramps appear sporadically predictably expected certain level exertion
one may also want ask potential triggers movement sensory emotional stimuli hyperventilation cold fasting
assess anything alleviates cramps
course symptoms
relatively recent onset suggests possibility acquired intercurrent illness whereas affliction since youth may point inherited disorder
important recognize several entities may confused cramps
disorders muscle relaxation myotonia hypothyroidism patient may perceive uncomfortable painless muscle tightness stiffness often made worse cold
one get clue myotonia patient admits difficulty releasing grip handshake doorknob cooking pan improves repeated contractions
rare ailments produce sensation stiffness via various mechanisms see table
focal dystonias share certain similarities may easily mistaken cramps
dystonia refers movement disorder manifest assumption involuntary abnormal postures
patients may relate spasmodic even painful bending twisting movements extremity neck face trunk remain persistent attitude e g overextendedoverflexed posture hand inversion foot pulling head one side
sometimes spasms occur relation interfere specific skilled motor act called writer cramp
slower onset inappropriate contraction many opposing muscles unusual postures evoked help distinguish dystonia
far away common patient complaint crampy feeling meant aching discomfort muscles without visible palpable hardening
myalgias common childhood
also seen variety neuromuscular systemic illnesses well context generalized pervasive fatigue without objective muscle weakness depressed patients
emphasized though conditions along abnormal muscle contractions may occur conjunction actual muscle cramps
patients historians lumpers splittersthey may complain cramps one many symptoms include number different phenomena rubric cramps

appropriate queries might include weakness numbness paresthesias present may indicate underlying neuromuscular disorder
muscle twitching noted
fasciculations spontaneous visible muscle twitches due contraction motor unit seen several neuropathic disorders associated cramping
also appear benign condition muscle cramps particularly people large muscles
bouts myoglobinuria occur
sign reflecting muscle fiber breakdown ascertained asking urine ever becomes cola colored
carefulpatients frequently say urine becomes dark concentrated rarely admit actually turns brownish

family history cramps
normal voluntary motor activity depends functional integrity motor unit comprising lower motor neuron muscle fibers innervates also descending spinal excitatory inhibitory circuits influence
cramps may result malfunction various points pathway
muscle fibers contract response impulses generated lower motor neurons
arrival impulses action potentials ap presynaptic nerve terminals neurotransmitter acetylcholine released
sufficient amounts acetylcholine activate postsynaptic receptors muscle ap produced
ap transmitted interior muscle fiber liberates calcium stored sarcoplasmic reticulum system tubules surround contractile filaments actin myosin
calcium binds regulatory protein permitting chemical interaction actin myosin results muscle shortening
energy contraction supplied hydrolysis adenosine triphosphate atp
muscle relaxation depends active reuptake calcium sarcoplasmic reticulum
reuptake energy dependent process requiring atp
thus atp lacking muscle remains shortened even absence continued action potentials
known contracture
alternatively reuptake occurs second ap arrives muscle relaxed contraction continued
motor neuron firing frequencies hz twitches fuse sustained contraction
activity motor neuron modulated spinal interneurons via presynaptic postsynaptic inhibition decrease motor neuron excitability
energy muscle contraction produced either carbohydrate fatty acid metabolism
oversimply put resting muscle predominantly utilizes lipid
intense anaerobic exercise additional atp generated glycogen breakdown
prolonged mild moderate activity however fatty acids provide principal fuel
scheme one could postulate number mechanisms muscle cramps
may impairment normal descending spinal inhibitory pathways subsequent motor neuron overactivity
could hyperirritability motor nerves anywhere cell body terminal muscular branches
level muscle fiber deficiency atp might prevent calcium reuptake sarcoplasmic reticulum leaving fiber shortened state
indeed examples every mechanism thought exist described next section
mentioned previously cramps due variety causes
cramps remain benign mysterious others definite nature respond specific therapy
ordinary muscle cramps characterized painfully hard palpable contraction explosive onset times preceded followed brief twitches usually involves one muscle time
may precipitated volitional movement trivial extent forceful contraction muscle already shortened may occur exercise
cramps terminated passive stretching muscle activation antagonist
severe cramps muscle may remain sore tender days
leg cramps fairly common elderly hardly unusual otherwise healthy athletic individuals appear frequently certain clinical settings see table
mechanism relatively familiar malady remained obscure although popular theory suggests intramuscular nerve branches reason rendered hyperexcitable
clinically similar different pathophysiologic basis cramps correctly contractures muscle associated various metabolic myopathies
several inherited disorders glycogen metabolism myophosphorylase mcardle phosphofructokinase tauri deficiency patients classically experience myalgias painful hard muscle cramps vigorous exercise
occasionally episode cramps followed myoglobinuria excessive could induce acute renal insufficiency
conversely patients deficient carnitine palmityl transferase enzyme critical fatty acid oxidation get cramps prolonged exercise especially fasted state low carbohydrate diet cold weather
proposed physiologic thread ties conditions together acute depletion atp exercise disrupting calcium reuptake sarcoplasmic reticulum preventing muscle relaxation
tetany cramplike syndrome consisting painless spasms notable carpopedal distribution potentially involving muscles
hand typically assumes posture tonic adduction thumb fingers flexion metacarpophalangeal joints extension interphalangeal joints
toe becomes plantar flexed ankle inverted
spasms commonly precipitated hyperventilation preceded tingling paresthesias mouth fingers toes discriminative feature dystonia
tetany seen states cause alkalosis reduction ionized calcium magnesium appear render peripheral nerves hyperirritable
focal disorder peripheral nerve function hemifacial spasm
potentially facial movement e g blinking may provoke either fine twitching prolonged gross spasms facial muscles
believed cases attributable compression facial nerve posterior fossa
tetanus contrast due suppression spinal inhibitory neurons exotoxin bacterium clostridium tetani
clinically involuntary spasms triggered movement sensory emotional stimuli superimposed state virtually continuous stiffness
symptoms may begin vicinity wound remain localized often become generalized
even localized form one may note mild trismus due susceptibility masseter innervation
persistent muscular rigidity painful cramps also occur strychnine poisoning black widow spider bites rare stiff man syndrome
patients prominent spasticity due spinal cord lesions frequently complain stiffness muscle cramps spasms
presumably damage descending motor pathways disrupts normal suprasegmental inhibitory influences spinal motor neurons allowing afferent sensory impulses evoke unbridled reflex activity
result flexor spasms thigh knee foot set cutaneous visceral e g distended bladder stimuli
reflexogenic nature times accompanied autonomic responses sweating piloerection incontinence
