hyperosmia increased olfactory acuity hypoosmia diminished olfactory acuity
anosmia inability recognize odors may unilateral bilateral
dysosmia abnormal sense smell
carry vial nonirritating substance bag vanilla lemon freshly ground coffee good examples tobacco scented soap necessary
odors stimulate olfactory receptors
use irritating odors camphor menthol
substances stimulate trigeminal sensory receptors addition olfactory receptors potentially giving false result
inform patient going test sense smell
patient places index finger one nostril block e g right index finger right nostril
closes eyes
instruct patient sniff repetitively tell odor detected identifying odor recognized
bring test odor within cm less nose
touch patient test
movement body give clue test object presented
give auditory clues
repeat process nostril
smell intact patient reports detection odor
recognition odor involves olfactory memory higher cortical function
olfactory epithelium occupies
cm area apex nostril
patch yellowish brown mucosa located small cavity main nasal passage
reason sniffing provides rapid stimulation normal breathing
receptors surrounded nasal mucous membrane covered thin layer moisture
two kinds receptors
first kind consists trigeminal nerve fibers sensitive irritating substances temperature neuroanatomy similar pain temperature receptors elsewhere body
second kind receptor consists olfactory nerve cells form receptor olfaction
soma body cell lies olfactory epithelium
olfactory epithelium primitive type sensory epithelium lending support concept olfaction phylogenetically oldest senses
cell receptor bipolar first order neuron
single dendrite projects apical pole cell surface epithelium
dendrite ends apical dendritic knob olfactory knob
knob gives rise long delicate nonmotile cilia extend mucus covering sensory epithelium
olfactory neuron unlike neurons life span days
new neurons differentiate stem cells deepest basal region olfactory epithelium
basal pole neuron gives rise single unmyelinated axon
axons form bundles sheathed schwann cells pass cribiform plate synapse olfactory bulb
axons collectively known olfactory nerve
detection threshold odorants quite low air
studies suggest volume concentration receptor molecules mucus range
olfactory neuron receptor molecules cilia
odors penetrate mucus overlying sensory epithelium gain access receptors virtue partition diffusion coefficients olfactory mucus
odorant traverses mucus range dozen milliseconds forms complex receptor time span
odorant molecule combines integral membrane proteins form receptor
proteins odorant gated channels mediate sensory transduction located membranes olfactory cilia apical dendritic olfactory knob
voltage gated channels located initial axonal segment axolemma associated impulse initiation propagation
second messenger system probably g protein adenylate cyclase cascade
precise mechanisms leading detection identification odors area active vigorous research
figure
illustrates possible molecular model olfactory reception
structure olfactory bulb quite complex
structural units discrete spherical bodies glomeruli
mm diameter
axons olfactory cell first order neuron synapse glomeruli primary dendrites mitral cells second order neuron
number receptors converge mitral cell large
cell types bulb include tufted cells whose dendrites also participate synaptic connections glomeruli
olfactory bulbs apparently participate extensively processing olfactory information
least five feedback loops interconnections within bulb
connections olfactory bulb via anterior commissure
centrifugal fibers conveying impulses brain influence activity bulb
bulb apparently follows neural organization visual sensory systems
interplay inhibitory excitatory mechanisms acting process incoming information efferent influence cortex
axons leave olfactory bulb olfactory tract
tufted cell axons mainly pass laterally anterior commissure contralateral olfactory bulb
mitral cell axons project centrally
central areas olfactory bulb projects include anterior perforated space amygdaloid nucleus cortex piriform lobe
secondary tertiary connections various areas including limbic system
hyperosmia lowered threshold odors occurs addison disease mucoviscidosis
clinical perception hyperosmia ordinarily impossible either history taking bedside testing
hypoosmia usually caused local processes involve nasal olfactory mucosa
examples include rhinitis due common cold allergy smoking certain industrial fumes intranasal polyps carcinoma
pernicious anemia diabetes vitamin deficiency cause diminished olfactory acuity
pernicious anemia also cause anosmia
hypoosmia occur total laryngectomy
reasons known
anosmia may bilateral unilateral
patient recognize bilateral anosmia unilateral anosmia usually perceived
head trauma probably frequent cause incidence
one large series
blows occiput five times likely produce anosmia blows forehead contrecoup effect
injury trivial go almost unnoticed
tumors floor anterior fossa meningiomas sphenoid ridge olfactory groove produce anosmia usually unilateral
meningitis abscess associated osteomyelitis frontal ethmoid bones produce anosmia
congenital absence smell present albinos
subarachnoid hemorrhage cause anosmia
hysteria another cause anosmia
hysteria identified comparing perception coffee vanilla ammonia perception
coffee vanilla principally stimulate olfactory cell receptors
ammonia trigeminal nerve stimulator
anosmia organic cause ammonia detected coffee vanilla odor
number neurological diseases cause dysosmia dysfunction smell alzheimer disease korsakoff psychosis huntington chorea parkinson disease
pathologic changes olfactory system may among earliest changes alzheimer disease
olfactory hallucinations usually unpleasant odors burned rubber occur epilepsy withdrawal states certain psychiatric conditions
amygdala may source hallucinations
valuable clinical corollary patient often reports hypoosmia anosmia decreased absent ability taste food
example pernicious anemia leading possibility elderly patient spastic paraparesis anemia complains longer enjoys eating food taste
