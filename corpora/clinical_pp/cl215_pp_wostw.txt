general appearance patient may provide diagnostic clues illness severity disease patient values social status personality
astute physician begin gather information immediately upon meeting patient
observing gait facial features expression handshake quality voice physician may begin detect unique qualities potential problems
physicians ability remember patient name face many years pay intense attention initial encounter
detail unimportant
following evaluated systematically
facies expression table
gait table
clothing paraphernalia table clothes appropriate time year
jewelry makeup say patient
particular scarf hat patch covering area deformity disease
stature habitus table observe patient body build
short stature seen dwarfism pseudohypoparathyroidism turner syndrome prepubertal steroid therapy
tall lanky individuals long thin extremities suggest marfan syndrome posture decubitus table normal state resting tone muscle groups results healthy upright posture tone greatest antigravity muscles
alteration tone may result characteristic postures parkinson disease stroke cerebellar abnormalities
decubitus refers observed posture patient bed
patient prefer lie one side occurs lateral decubitus position patient abdominal disease
patient lying still bed might occur peritonitis flailing seen renal colic
odor breath body table breath suggest poor hygiene anaerobic infection
comatose patient fruity odor diabetic ketoacidosis
physician much like detective searching clues history physical examination reserving judgment quest conclusive data
read example following passage emphasizes sherlock holmes powers observation
pon word watson coming along wonderfully
really done well indeed
true missed everything importance hit upon method quick eye colour
never trust general impressions boy concentrate upon details
first glance always woman sleeve
man perhaps better first take knee trouser
observe woman plush upon sleeves useful material showing traces
double line little wrist typewritist presses table beautifully defined
sewing machine hand type leaves similar mark left arm side farthest thumb instead right across broadest part
glanced face observing dint pince nez either side nose ventured remark upon short sight typewriting seemed surprise
surprised
surely obvious
much surprised interested glancing observe though boots wearing unlike really odd ones one slightly decorated toe cap plain one
one buttoned two lower buttons five first third fifth
see young lady otherwise neatly dressed come away home odd boots half buttoned great deduction say came away hurry
general appearance demands less data collection represented items database content
yet information gleaned patient appearance particularly valuable since usually first bit objective data
examining general appearance patient may likened surveying forest walking among trees
writings years ago contain best descriptions relating patient appearance disease
osler detailed description patient typhoid fever classic example
sensitivity specificity patient appearance withstood test time
excellent clinicians continue use technique high yield
learned looking patient face eyes
eyes called windows soul face mirror mind
authors poets described importance observation
physicians long remember patients faces pain anger pleading vividly expressed human face
clues endocrine physiologic abnormalities may also become apparentthe rounded facies cushing disease prominent jaw frontal bossing acromegaly exophthalmos hyperthyroidism
icteric sclera may tell patient alcohol problem stated
pallor may quickly explain shortness breath
lateral thinning eyebrows may suggest hypothyroidism periorbital edema may represent nephrotic syndrome butterfly rash may predict lupus erythematosus
simple handshake may help assess circulatory system suggest active inflammation patient arthritis differentiate cold moist hands anxious patient warm moist ones thyrotoxic patient
patient voice may suggest fear depression mania
speech also first clue dysarthria aphasia
thickened low pitch hypothyroidism hoarseness laryngeal carcinoma detected careful listener
observation shuffling gait require particular review symptoms signs parkinsons disease physical examination particularly directed toward assessment mobility
similarly gait may suggest mild hemiparesis secondary stroke ataxia cerebellar disease
illustration patient appearance reveal shown following case
patient rural area brought clinic family members
cachectic thin clothes fit loosely
face shows great sadness fear
speech difficult mouth dry fecal odor evident breath
pale sclera icteric head bobs body jars heartbeat
shaking hands skin warm nails subungual hemorrhages
hole cut shoe large toe protrudes
patient extremely ill detailed history physical examination provide necessary data diagnosis treatment
however important information already collected used make hypotheses chart course
patient chronic debilitating disease
perhaps fears medical care delayed presentation resulted advanced disease
odor breath suggests poor oral hygiene head bobbing suggests advanced aortic regurgitation
presentation could consistent subacute endocarditis
subungual hemorrhages provide support hypothesis
pale complexion scleral icterus may caused hemolytic anemia secondary endocarditis chronic hemolytic anemia might cause gout requiring modified shoe
hypotheses generated data obtained patient general appearance
possibilities require confirmation detailed history fever chills weight loss night sweats physical examination aortic regurgitant murmur splenomegaly podagra laboratory data blood cultures complete blood count peripheral smear uric acid
used patient general appearance begin scientific process eventually lead accurate diagnosis
