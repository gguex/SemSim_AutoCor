early concern value annual comprehensive physical examination apparently well adults began expressed
concern identified number problems examinations
one concern lack sensitivity annual examination serious disease despite fairly frequent detection deviations normal particularly elderly individuals e g bunions
related problem low prevalence serious disease asymptomatic populations consequent low predictive value positive test results ordered screening purposes see chapter
example positive stress electrocardiogram performed asymptomatic year old man prevalence significant coronary disease likely represent false positive result significant coronary artery disease
third concern risk discomfort cost examinations including worry visits could actually increase patient anxiety due false positive results cause inappropriate care seeking facilitating patient sick role decrease patients self care provision false reassurance
concerns cost continue raised including cost making adequate screening facilities available patients providing follow abnormal findings
another concern examinations may applied need least burden disease risk factors disproportionately present lower socioeconomic populations groups typically receive encouraged receive periodic comprehensive examinations
final concern focus examinations
emphasizing advancing knowledge disease rather improving health status examinations concentrated secondary rather primary prevention
primary prevention involves identification risk factors behaviors could reduced reversed adversely affect health future
even behaviors identified periodic examinations typically linked behavior change efforts
may part due physician pessimism motivating patients achieve lasting behavior change
breslow somers made series recommendations regarding examination well adults took consideration many concerns
called inclusion preventive packages incorporated day day care patients rational varying periodicity rather annual package tailored specific age gender needs rather single vague check selected based scientific proof efficacy least prudent interpretation available evidence
finally recommendations included educational counseling practices designed influence health related behaviors e g seat belt use smoking habits
rationale package approach based fact prevention activities need highly focused needs partly time limited partly cost effectiveness highly linked prevalence
consequently prevention activities need based epidemiologic data identify frequent causes death serious morbidity
adults age causes communicable disease motor vehicle accidents coronary heart disease stroke cancer table along lifestyle concomitants seat belt usage alcohol consumption smoking habits dietary fat intake
epidemiologic burden suggest conditions targeted growing body evidence attests benefit primary secondary prevention activities reducing morbidity mortality
veterans administration cooperative study recent hypertension detection follow program attest benefit lowering diastolic blood pressure prevention stroke perhaps coronary artery disease
lipid research clinics trial studies shown decreased mortality high risk men achieve cholesterol lowering
demonstration benefit early detection treatment certain cancers difficult
sometimes demonstration benefit apparent real problem lead time bias
many cancer detection efforts may simply increase time presence cancer known thereby appear advance survival rather make real change disease outcome figure
nevertheless studies beginning demonstrate benefit cancer detection efforts particularly cervical breast carcinoma women possibly skin colorectal carcinomas sexes
several sets recommendations issued deal periodic examination well adults
set recommendations slightly different figure attempted base recommendations careful scrutiny available scientific evidence agreed
number conditions sought screened limited annual examinations abandoned age sex risk specific packages developed
persons certain high risk groups e g pregnant women iv drug users family history breast carcinoma require different intensive types screening
recommendations apply asymptomatic individuals
whereas routine immunization become accepted obligation pediatric practice true physicians caring adults
substantial portion remaining morbidity mortality vaccine preventable diseases occurs older adults adolescents
adults primary immunization tetanus diphtheria followed continued booster doses adult toxoids every years
young adults age years immunized measles mumps history previous infection vaccination
rubella well documented history vaccination immunity checked laboratory testing clinical diagnosis undependable susceptible young adults women childbearing age vaccinated pregnant women vaccinated
persons receive influenza pneumococcal vaccines former annual basis
booster doses pneumococcal vaccine currently recommended
adults receive inactivated polio vaccine never previously immunized traveling endemic areas
motor vehicle accidents major cause morbidity mortality young adults contributing roles alcohol consumption failure use seat belts well documented
unfortunately efficacy physician counseling regarding measures yet known recommendations call counseling particularly adolescents young adults regarding practices
prevention unwanted pregnancy sexually transmitted diseases could also thought accidents worthy prevention counseling young adults
hypertension prevalent major risk factor stroke coronary artery disease benefited lowering elevated blood pressure including mild elevations mm hg sustained
blood pressure measured adults least every years experts suggest measured anyone visit physician
coronary artery disease sequelaeangina pectoris myocardial infarction sudden cardiac deathhave high annual death rates evidence support early treatment asymptomatic patients
available screening tests resting stress ecgs performed patients severely limited due low prevalence problem
consequently prevention coronary artery disease directed identification correctable risk factors cigarette smoking hypertension hypercholesterolemia rather detection occult disease
cigarette smoking hypercholesterolemia identified early possible
adults blood cholesterol measured initial visit every years thereafter
adults moderate th th percentile high risk th percentile age categories treated dietary intervention table
high risk individuals respond inadequately diet treated appropriate drugs
american cancer society made major contributions development periodic examinations well adults cancer related health check upthe tests procedures health counseling recommended prevention early detection cancer table
four cancers singled periodic screening based considerations prevalence benefit early detection risk feasibility screening procedures colorectal lung cancer men women breast cervical carcinoma women
cancers seem like ideal screening cancers common lethal year survival dependent upon stage tumor diagnosis
lung cancer common lethal cancer men becoming women
accounts cancer deaths overall year survival rate
regard screening problem lack good feasible early detection procedure
several studies attested lack benefit periodic chest x rays detecting curable lung cancers
periodic cytologic screening sputum may benefit costs enormous
currently recommended procedure lung cancer area primary prevention earliest possible detection intervention cigarette smoking
situation colorectal carcinoma also complicated
common lethal cancer overall year survival year survival dukes b stages
many studies attest ability guaiac impregnated slides hemoccult detect early stage carcinomas whether mortality lowered yet demonstrated
recent studies suggest guaiac impregnated slides may insensitive polyps become cancerous perhaps many carcinomas
consequently mortality benefit realized screening likelihood guaiac slide testing sigmoidoscopy necessary
current recommendations cancer society annual stool guaiac tests adults age plus sigmoidoscopy every years two negative examinations year apart
breast cancer recommendations dominated two studies demonstrated mortality lowering women screened annual breast examinations age coupled periodic mammography annually one study every years another
concerns raised feasibility cost offering every woman united states yearly mammogram age biannually ages although appears dominant recommendation united states present
finally pap test shown epidemiologically decrease incidence mortality invasive cervical carcinoma periodic testing widely recommended although variation interval recommended examinations
despite widespread nature cervical cancer screening recommendations numerous women either never papanicolaou test received regular basis
screening ought occur least every years normal risk women continue indefinitely
cancer society recommends cancers screened periodic cancer related check include examination skin oral cavity neck lymph node digital rectal examination testicular ovarian examination performed annually age although group makes recommendation
surveys physicians practices reveal actual performance recommended primary secondary prevention procedures surprisingly low range given frequency well adult visits
disagreement published recommendations one reason cited even physicians state agreement screening recommendations performance still low particularly items physicians must perform rather order done others
suggests barriers implementing periodic health procedures recommended canadian task force others
barriers include lack physician knowledge recommended procedures lack skill particularly counseling area forgetfulness lack motivation due conflicting recommendations patient resistance lack reimbursement
major factor may well boredom repetitive activities low frequency yielding abnormal results well lack time clue short office visits agendas
successful implementation components periodic health examination likely require reminder systems assistance staff organized system patient education periodic assessment physician performance
number important questions respect examination well adults remain answered
foremost among include pay implement activities wide scale
present small number activities procedures tailored specific age gender risk needs identified
activities periodically included routine care adult patients
emphasis primary prevention including identification risk factors personal behaviors related risk factors well organized office systems ensure activities actually carried
