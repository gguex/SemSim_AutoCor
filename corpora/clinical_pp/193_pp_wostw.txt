introduction flame photometry late made measurement sodium concentration practical reliable laboratory determination
increasing clinical experience abnormalities sodium concentration followed stimulated studies helped explain control plasma sodium level pathogenesis changes value
flame photometer replaced automated methods using ion specific sodium electrodes provide equally reliable measurement plasma sodium concentration
disturbances serum sodium concentration often seen hospitalized patients may provide clinician valuable inferences nature severity underlying disease process
necessary stress conceptual importance distinguishing body sodium content concentration sodium body fluids
active energy requiring processes cell boundary exclude sodium intracellular compartment practical purposes confine extracellular fluid
concentration governed addition removal water extracellular compartment
changes content sodium stimulate addition removal water thus determine volume extracellular fluid
two mechanisms serve maintain plasma sodium concentration narrow range healthy subject
thirst antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin release
concentration osmotically active plasma solutes sodium important govern controls
contribution sodium plasma osmolality apparent formula calculating plasma osmolality
substituting normal values
absence hyperglycemia renal failure sodium concentration chief determinant plasma osmolality
rise osmolality antidiuretic hormone release subsequently thirst stimulated organism conserves water reducing urinary excretion water minimum seeks drinks water restore plasma osmolality normal figure
two controlling systems thirst important
even absence antidiuretic hormone resulting inability conserve water thirst drive sufficient allow maintenance normal plasma sodium concentration albeit expense nuisance polydipsia polyuria
patient denied access water unable obtain water unconsciousness disability serum sodium concentration rise resulting hypernatremia
situation pure water deficit amount sodium extracellular fluid normal concentration increased
dilution body solute water excessive water overly vigorous administration intravenous fluids leads inhibition antidiuretic hormone release water diuresis restoring plasma osmolality normal
addition osmolar control vasopressin release sizable contraction extracellular fluid volume range may also trigger release vasopressin conservation water
decrease effective blood volume even total extracellular fluid volume increased may effect
normal mechanisms controlling release antidiuretic hormone disturbed reasonassociated diseases profound changes volume extracellular fluid administration certain drugswater may retained dilution plasma solutes e hyponatremia result even sodium content extracellular fluid normal
water deficit plasma sodium concentration rises water excess falls regardless extracellular fluid content
even though plasma sodium concentration tells us nothing extracellular fluid volume allows inference regarding intracellular volume
increase plasma sodium plasma osmolality attracts water cell leading shrinkage intracellular volume
hyponatremia decreased plasma osmolality allows flow water cell expands intracellular volume
since sodium major osmotically active particle since changes osmotic activity govern thirst antidiuretic hormone release consequent gain loss water may seen sodium content key factor controlling volume extracellular fluid
gain sodium leads seeking retaining water expansion extracellular fluid volume
loss sodium least initially leads loss water contraction extracellular fluid volume
thus sodium metabolism governs volume extracellular fluid
health expansion extracellular fluid volume leads renal sodium excretion contraction extracellular fluid volume leads renal conservation sodium
precise say contraction effective extracellular fluid volume blood volume
effective blood volume difficult define exactly seems relate best adequate filling arterial circuit
requires maintenance adequate cardiac output adequate intravascular volume normal peripheral resistance
reduced cardiac output hypoalbuminemia reduction blood volume arteriovenous fistula serve diminish fullness circulation conditions may lead sodium retention
abnormalities extreme may signal sodium retention also antidiuretic hormone release may lead water retention hyponatremia
occurs amount sodium extracellular fluid increased concentration reduced
thus water metabolism governs concentration extracellular fluid whereas sodium metabolism governs volume extracellular fluid
rarely hypernatremia result excess sodium
virtually always due deficit water
nevertheless absolute sodium excess occurred infants given excessive salt formulas occasionally patients given large amounts hypertonic sodium bicarbonate resuscitation cardiopulmonary arrest
hypernatremia due water deficit exemplified patient impaired absent antidiuretic hormone release central diabetes insipidus inability kidney respond antidiuretic hormone nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
two rather special situations common
cases hypernatremia seen hospital practice elderly patients varying degrees impairment mental function often residents nursing homes
pathogenesis hypernatremia clinical setting inability conserve water either impaired thirst drive debility inability obtain water
patients unless malnourished concentrate urine normally disabled bedridden dependent attendants provide water
amount water provided inadequate especially insensible losses increased fever high environmental temperatures hypernatremia results
occasional patients may perception thirst even increases plasma osmolality less common mechanism
symptoms hypernatremia hyponatremia central nervous system origin consist changes thought processes level consciousness

hypernatremic patients disturbed consciousness leading stupor confusion compounds problem patient even less likely seek request water water deficit hypernatremia worsen
sequence may progress irreversible neurologic damage death
treatment consists administration solute free water restore plasma sodium osmolality normal
many patients either hypo hypernatremia asymptomatic
two features greatest importance determining presence absence symptoms degree abnormality rapidity change developed
symptoms attributable changes sodium concentration unusual unless sodium level meql

variations plasma water may produce apparent actual abnormalities plasma sodium spurious hyponatremia
hyperlipidemic states pronounced hyperproteinemia water content per unit volume plasma reduced
conditions plasma sodium concentration per liter plasma water normal reduction water content sodium concentration per liter plasma reduced

importance condition lies recognition confused hyponatremic states
hyponatremia may occur addition osmotically active particles glucose uncontrolled diabetes mellitus exogenous solutes like mannitol glycerol used osmotic diuretic lower intraocular pressure glaucoma respectively
examples presence osmotically active solute confined extracellular compartment attracts water cell diluting extracellular fluid lowering sodium concentration
despite reduced sodium concentration osmolality normal increased state could termed hypertonic hyponatremia
instances hyponatremia indicates hypotonicity water excess amount sodium present
isotonic hyponatremia hyperlipidemia dysproteinemia hypertonic hyponatremia hyperglycemia exogenous solute eliminated may concluded disproportionate water retention occurred hypotonic hyponatremia result

features separating patients hyponatremia different categories based extracellular fluid volume outlined table
consider first patients expanded extracellular fluid volume
important point note presence absence edema ascites signs congestive heart failure gallop rhythm basilar rales
patients congestive heart failure cirrhosis ascites appearance hyponatremia relatively late development usually history preexisting edema dyspnea aid physician
states edema fluid sodium concentration plasma total body sodium increased
disproportionate retention water however led dilution extracellular fluid solute hence term sometimes applied disorder dilutional hyponatremia
although mechanism hyponatremia patients topic debate past appears instances release antidiuretic hormone due reduction effective intravascular volume major contributor water retention
skilled clinicians learned patients excrete water loads poorly infusion solute free water dextrose water hypotonic saline may produce aggravate hyponatremia
management depends improvement underlying disease restriction water intake
approach appropriate hyponatremia severe less meql symptomatic altered level consciousness
contrast patients become depleted sodium hypovolemic
sodium lost extracellular fluid initially loss water extracellular fluid volume reduced
loss water occurs sodium loss decreases plasma osmolality thus inhibits vasopressin release
addition reduced osmolality extracellular fluid leads movement water intracellular space
moderate sodium losses water lost proportionately plasma sodium concentration remains normal
sodium losses continue exceed approximately meq reduction extracellular fluid plasma volume become sufficient trigger release antidiuretic hormone
patient drinks water given hypotonic fluid water excreted
tonicity sacrificed volume water retained hyponatremia results
teleologically eminently sound mechanism
water losses continued pari passu sodium hypotension impaired cerebral coronary perfusion ultimately death would result
better alive hyponatremia dead normal serum sodium
condition appropriate management clear replacement sodium water losses
replacement usually given isotonic sodium solutions normal saline one half normal saline meq sodium bicarbonate added often used
symptomatic hyponatremia uncommon setting present treatment hypertonic saline warranted
water retained absence sodium deficit presence normal circulation slight expansion extracellular fluid volume dilution solutes hyponatremia results

confusion belligerent behavior stupor coma seizures may seen progressive hyponatremia particularly plasma sodium concentration fallen rapidly
approaches treatment include
acute hypertonic saline hypertonic saline plus furosemide chronic water restriction demeclocycline furosemide

morphologic change note loss myelin certain areas central nervous system particularly pons hence name central pontine myelinolysis
role rate correction hyponatremia syndrome debated
since elevation plasma sodium concentration meql patients symptomatic hyponatremia usually reverses neurologic abnormalities rapid elevation sodium level necessary may harmful
additional causes hyponatremia mentioned
patients acute oliguric renal failure infusions hypotonic solutions dextrose water hypotonic saline inevitably lead hyponatremia unless solutions given replace known losses
situation administered water place go dilution plasma sodium result
psychotic patients sometimes drink large amounts water upward l per day
may present hyponatremia seizures stupor
pathogenesis clear many patients although reduction water intake usually corrects hyponatremic state reverses symptoms
treatment thiazide diuretics impairs ability excrete water
prescribed compulsive water drinkers symptomatic hyponatremia coma seizures result
similar sequence may observed elderly patients given thiazide diuretics given hypotonic fluids postoperative period
certain drugs may also impair water excretion lead hyponatremia
chlorpropamide clofibrate carbamazepine vincristine cyclophosphamide
finally plasma sodium level reduced meql pregnancy
