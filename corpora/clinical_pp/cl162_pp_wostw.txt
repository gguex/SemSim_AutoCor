pain discomfort may arise around articulation mandibular condyle glenoid fossa temporal bone
pain may mild severe acute long standing sharp dull character
facial pain originating area temporomandibular joint tmj may due intraarticular disease disorders adjacent structures outside joint combination
question patient character pain whether remains localized spreads adjacent areas ear angle mandible neck
tmj pain often dull constant ache aggravated opening mandible chewing
may complaint limited jaw opening frequent clicking popping grinding noise within joint associated mandibular movement mastication
associated symptoms may include tinnitus changes hearing facial numbness headache
symptoms may worse morning particularly patient clenches grinds teeth sleep
questioning patient bed partner helpful regard
history systemic disease e g rheumatoid arthritis manifest tmj ear infection trauma mandible e g motor vehicle accident altercation difficult tooth removal prolonged jaw opening dental treatment sought
patient may taking medications e g phenothiazine tranquilizers cause dystonic movements masticatory muscles neuromuscular disorder e g parkinsonism involuntary dislocation tmj occurs
patient questioned possible job marital interpersonal conflicts might enhance stress related habits e g clenching bruxism habitual subluxation
normal function temporomandibular joint depends coordination rest mandibular movement joint position masticatory muscle activity occlusion teeth
highly sensitive proprioceptive nerve endings structures provide input maintains equilibrium function normal state
delicately balanced anatomic area body improper function easily initiated susceptible patient
aside injuries systemic illnesses occasionally involve tmj vast majority disorders stress related
parafunctional habits e g bruxism clenching responsible sustained contraction masticatory muscles become self perpetuating chronic called myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome mpds
vast majority mpds patients young otherwise healthy females
sensory nerve supply tmj principally branches auriculotemporal nerve component mandibular division trigeminal nerve
pain disease mandible mandibular teeth therefore easily referred preauricular area misinterpreted originating within tmj
conversely intra periarticular tmj pain may perceived patient earache treatment may sought basis
differentiation pain originating within joint coming extraarticular structures essential successful treatment
distinction always made history however intra extraarticular structures may involved simultaneously
patient stress related mpds usually complains constant dull pain may may exacerbated mastication mandibular movement relieved jaw rest
quite often pain worse morning related nighttime parafunctional clenching bruxism
patient intraarticular tmj pain due arthritis pain relieved jaw rest may pain free except moving mandible masticating solid food
unfortunately intraarticular tmj disease often involves masticatory muscles secondarily types pain intra extraarticular experienced simultaneously patient
joint noise function highly suggestive intraarticular disease
grinding crepitus often indicates arthritic degenerative process caused contact roughened bony surfaces function
clicking popping joint usually associated displacement fibrocartilaginous disk meniscus separates joint upper lower compartments
limitation mandibular opening may due reflex spasm masticatory muscles secondary mpds fibrous bony ankylosis joint fracture mandibular condyle total anterior displacement joint meniscus blocks normal forward movement mandibular condyle
