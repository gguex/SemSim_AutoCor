physical examination process evaluating objective anatomic findings use observation palpation percussion auscultation
information obtained must thoughtfully integrated patient history pathophysiology
moreover unique situation patient physician understand interaction intended diagnostic therapeutic
physical examination thoughtfully performed yield data necessary patient diagnosis management
almost without exception medical history patient available time physical examination
rarely may history best brief recordings acute events
information pertinent physical examination learned observation speech gestures habits gait manipulation features extremities
interactions relatives staff often revealing
pigmentary changes cyanosis jaundice pallor may noted
diaphoresis blanching flushing may provide clues vasomotor tone related mood physiologic abnormalities
aspects patient habits interests relationships ascertained pictures books magazines personal objects bedside
aside hospital room office physical examination may occur variety settings difficult establish privacy quiet
best resource available physician set stage physical examination communicate respect genuine interest patient welfare
patient addressed politely asked perform required maneuvers examination technique far preferable imperative language want
patients prepared unpleasant portions examination
aside explanations reassurance necessary maintain continuous conversation patient examination
avoid embarrassing patient
certain draping material used appropriately personal areas subjected undue exposure
examination ends abruptly may diminish value doctor patient relationship may destroy therapeutic content
patient may benefit brief summary relevant findings may require reassurance found
single useful device optimal performance physical examination inquisitive sensitive mind
next useful mastery techniques observation palpation percussion auscultation
less important tools required examination table
environment affects quality physical examination wise arrange quiet privacy darkening room parts examination comfort patient examiner
complete examination proceed orderly fashion minimum required position shifts patient table
hand physician must able ascertain integrity various organ systems regional examinations
instance examination head neck physician must identify vascular neurologic lymphatic skeletal integumentary components must relate complements body regions
would tedious contrast examine vascular system entirety followed complete neurologic examination organ systems turn
examining anatomic region observer must alert appearance abnormality question time morphologic aspects abnormality clinical significance
general physical examination take many forms depending upon circumstances
often examiner evaluates body regions general way looking abnormalities
clues derived history signal need precise detailed examination given system
thorough physical examination often includes sequence presented table
clinically significant physical examination flexible entity vary needs patient
periodic examinations health assessment need comprehensive hospital admission examinations
contrast cost effective undertake complete physical examination patients presenting symptoms upper respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection
physical examination key part continuum extends history present illness therapeutic outcome
history physical examination linked properly physician reasoning capabilities laboratory tests large measure confirmatory
physical examination however weak link chain performed perfunctory superficial manner
understanding pathophysiologic mechanism physical abnormality essential correct diagnosis management
instance failure discriminate know origin carotid bruits transmitted sounds valvular origin critical significance
knowledge disease changes techniques physical examination become augmented
astute physician constantly reviews adds repertoire techniques physical examination
evaluation physical examination terms sensitivity specificity difficult
interpretation isolated physical findings often influenced presence absence historical information coexisting physical findings
instance assessment whether clubbing fingers present absent significant interobserver variability demonstrated influenced clinical appearance patient
number studies attempted look validity physical exam diagnostic tool
concept interobserver intraobserver variability introduced looking specific isolated findings
example judging presence absence râles likely agreed upon several observers repeated exams single blinded observer graded intensity breath sounds
presence absence ascites patients known liver disease shown difficult determine using physical exam techniques alone
bedside measurement forced expiratory time auscultation however shown small interobserver variability trained observers clinical value following degree airway obstruction
large degree variability observing many physical signs following recommendations made reporting interpreting physical findings
emphasis placed dichotomous variables e presence absence râles rather graded variables e intensity breath sounds
physical signs e clubbing fingers represent continuum obviously normal obviously abnormal
emphasis placed findings represent extremes rather borderline cases
recognition physical findings high degree interobserver variability important
good examples include detection moderate small amounts ascitic fluid detection diaphragmatic movement percussion
findings deemphasized favor better reproducibility
beneficial use body symmetry advantage
differences auscultated breath sounds similar area right left lung far clinically important overall decrease breath sounds
points kept mind physical exam fill proper role care patient
adjunct thorough history way physician interact physically patient
