ejection clicks high pitched sounds occur moment maximal opening aortic pulmonary valves
heard first heart sound
sounds occur presence dilated aorta pulmonary artery presence bicuspid flexible stenotic aortic pulmonary valve figure
ejection clicks may also called ejection sounds
diastolic correlate ejection click opening snap occurs maximal opening flexibly stenotic mitral tricuspid valve
clicks heard stethoscope auscultation heart
high frequency clicks best heard diaphragm stethoscope
aortic pulmonary clicks prominent along upper right left sternal border
mitral tricuspid clicks loudest along lower left sternal border apex
first step identifying click distinguish normal heart sounds determine timing cardiac cycle
best accomplished simultaneously auscultating heart palpating carotid artery pulse clearly identify first second heart sounds
systolic clicks may characterized location systole early mid late systolic clicks
timing click ascertained response respiration postural change valsalva maneuver various pharmacologic agents amyl nitrite phenylephrine evaluated
systolic clicks classified ejection nonejection clicks
systolic ejection clicks occur early systole may result either abrupt opening semilunar valves rapid distention proximal aorta pulmonary artery onset ejection
systolic ejection clicks may aortic pulmonary origin
two difficult differentiate
fact frequently difficult even separate systolic ejection click split first heart sound atrial gallop sound followed closely
aortic ejection clicks usually best heard diaphragm second right intercostal space apex whereas pulmonary ejection clicks maximal second left intercostal space left sternal border
pulmonary ejection clicks frequently decrease intensity merge first heart sound inspiration whereas aortic ejection clicks affected respiration
aortic pulmonary ejection clicks usually occur immediately coincident initial carotid upstroke however significant delay onset click suggests pulmonary origin
systolic nonejection clicks commonly produced mitral tricuspid valve apparatus
clicks usually occur mid late systole appear related tensing chordae tendineae valve leaflets mitral tricuspid valve prolapse present
clicks often multiple quite variable timing responsive changes ventricular volume induced posture pharmacologic agents
originally nonejection clicks thought extracardiac barlow subsequently others clearly demonstrated cardiac origin
mitral tricuspid clicks usually move earlier position systole response factors decrease left ventricular volume standing administration amyl nitrite
move later position systole response maneuvers squatting agents phenylephrine increase ventricular volume
right sided ejection clicks occur presence normal pulmonary valve loudest upper left sternal border usually accompanied enlarged pulmonary artery chest x ray
ejection clicks associated dilated pulmonary artery normal pulmonary valve consistent respiratory variation
origin unclear occurrence maximal opening pulmonary valve may coincidental may mean changes tensions valve cusps annulus related generation click
right sided ejection clicks may also heard association flexibly stenotic pulmonary valve
ejection clicks also heard upper left sternal border mild moderate stenosis respiratory variation
contrast right sided acoustic events e g murmur tricuspid regurgitation ejection click introducing murmur pulmonary stenosis becomes softer inspiration
pulmonary stenosis evokes hypertrophy right ventricle stiffening chamber
blood drawn right ventricle inspiration thickened right ventricle distend normally pressure chamber rises pulmonary valve partially opened
pulmonary valve partially open right ventricle contracts excursion less ejection click associated maximal opening softer earlier figure
severe valvular pulmonary stenosis right ventricle may stiff atrial contraction vigorous right atrial contraction actually opens pulmonary valve completely produces click late diastole
phonocardiogram recorded along pulmonary arterial pressure tracing ejection click associated pulmonary stenosis may seen correspond notch upstroke pulmonary arterial pressure tracing low frequency mechanical event also occurs maximal opening pulmonary valve
left sided ejection clicks occur presence dilated aorta aortic valve abnormalities
aortic valve normal left sided ejection clicks seem related dilation aortic root even though ejection click occurs maximal opening normal aortic valve
ejection clicks associated dilated aortic root best heard aortic area poorly transmitted apex
aortic valvular ejection clicks contrast loudest apex
aortic stenosis aortic ejection click precedes murmur
ejection clicks occur flexibly stenotic aortic valves nonstenotic bicuspid aortic valves
may difficult impossible distinguish aortic ejection click tricuspid component widely split
tricuspid component best heard left lower sternal border becomes louder inspiration
combination may also mistaken ejection click
atrial gallop best heard bell lightly applied cardiac apex associated presystolic apical impulse
like right sided ejection clicks aortic ejection click may correspond notch upstroke aortic pressure tracing carotid pulse tracing figure
notch apparently results maximal opening abrupt deceleration flexibly stenotic aortic valve
aortic valve immobilized heavy calcification sudden deceleration cusp motion occur ejection sound aortic component second heart sound soft absent
ejection click associated nonstenotic bicuspid aortic valve ejection click loud widely separated first heart sound
causes systolic clicks described mitral valve prolapse pseudoejection sound idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis aortic dissection ventricular septal aneurysm
correct identification ejection click prevents confusion heart sounds localizes ventricular outflow obstruction valvular level suggests presence bicuspid aortic valve dilation aorta pulmonary artery
