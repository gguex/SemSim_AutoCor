calculating ms
jones likelihood cad based stress test results dr
burns needed use sensitivity specificity test
obtained values published reports stress test results persons known free cad according cardiac catheterization
understood test characteristics express good poor test predicting presence disease
understanding characteristics derived helped decide whether use stress test
diagnostic tests indirect measures disease thus must standardized best estimate disease estimate often referred gold standard
stress test gold standard coronary arteriography
validity diagnostic test determined comparing test results gold standard results performed appropriate number selected patients
agreement occur diagnostic test said falsely positive falsely negative
thus sensitivity specificity diagnostic test describe ability test correctly classify patient compared gold standard
one additional feature dr
burns notes test cutoff point
clinicians generally desire diagnostic test results reported either abnormal normal e categorical
desire categorizing results presents problem since measurements biologic variables usually form continuum values
continuous values made categorical selecting point cutoff point along continuum assigning values one side point abnormal category side point normal category
sensitivity specificity test determined cutoff point selected
true test values diseased non diseased populations usually overlap
cutoff point chosen test high sensitivity high true positive rate specificity true negative rate usually lowered
unavoidable tradeoff important clinician since different cutoff points produce different test characteristics
thus clinician obtain different predictive values based particular cutoff point used
example exercise stress test cutoff point set mm st depression
effect using different cutoff points seen figure
cutoff point chosen st segment depression
mm test higher pvp given pretest probability less stringent cutoff points chosen
occurs fewer false positive tests
however remembered also greater number false negative test results
price paid choosing stringent criterion abnormal result
summary dr
burns realizes characteristics test determine validity usefulness particular disease
addition knows test characteristics vary depending choice cutoff point
question set cutoff point test received considerable attention stimulated clinicians look receiver operating characteristic curves test likelihood ratios
clinicians likelihood ratio useful test characteristic sensitivity specificity estimating probability disease following test result
using likelihood ratio plus estimate prior odds disease pretest odds clinician calculate positive test posttest odds disease
done multiplying likelihood ratio test prior odds disease obtain posttest odds disease

prior odds disease thus
sometimes written

formula follows

indicated table prior odds disease calculated dividing prior prevalence one minus prior prevalence
multiplying prior odds likelihood ratio gives last column posttest odds disease test positive
posttest odds easily converted posttest probability using odds numerator divided plus odds e
likelihood ratio incorporates sensitivity specificity test value vary depending cutoff point chosen
different likelihood ratios particular test cutoff point changes may derived receiver operating characteristic roc curve particular test consideration
curve plot sensitivity versus minus specificity test cutoff point changed
using personal computer dr
burns easily plot curve data obtained laboratory
minutes produce plot seen figure hypothetical roc curve stress test
pair coordinates taken curve may used calculate likelihood ratio thus along prior odds disease may used calculate posttest odds disease
clear curve false positive false negative rates low cutoff point
chosen
roc curves may also used compare efficiency different diagnostic tests used particular disease
hanley mcneil give excellent discussion use roc curves
test high specificity example would give relatively large likelihood ratio even sensitivity test low
occurs specificity denominator small value give relatively large likelihood ratio
may seen table
cutoff point set give specificity sensitivity
case likelihood ratio
seen multiplying value times pretest odds give much higher posttest odds data table
unfortunately something must lost obtaining higher likelihood ratio case false negative rate minus
student actually goes literature learn performance characteristics signs symptoms tests struck divergent estimates reported
sources variability derive patient selection factors differences technique performing test center center different stringency criteria constitutes abnormal result interobserver variability reading test results differences quality test administration
thus important able evaluate published reports respect validly studied performance characteristics
discussing skills beyond scope chapter ransohoff feinstein report department clinical epidemiology biostatistics mcmaster university contain excellent discussions issues
second clinician still needs incorporate probabilistic information gained history physical examination laboratory tests patient management decisions
many situations decisions complex selected clinical situations advocate using decision trees tool enable one maintain explicit approach patient management
makes little sense use explicit approach diagnosis suddenly hide assumptions steps reasoning went making therapeutic management decision
