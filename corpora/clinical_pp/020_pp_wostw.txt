apex impulse sought followed search additional pulsations
impulse characterized location size contour timing
carefully palpate pulsatile areas fingertips palm right hand
determine location size force duration impulses
examination repeated patient left lateral decubitus position
experience indispensable patient
hundreds examinations necessary clinical laboratory correlation order hone skill
anticipate warm phenomenon
visual tactile perception improve concentration moments
apical location often best estimated observation palpation apex patient sitting leaning forward exhaling
turning patient left lateral decubitus position improves appreciation contour apical pulsation prolongs thrust displaces laterally
best appreciate timing impulses essential auscultate heart sounds simultaneous observation palpation
palpation carotid artery also helpful timing msec delay carotid upstroke source confusion especially setting tachycardia
apex impulse generally results precordial displacement interventricular septum thrusts forward isovolumic contraction ventricles
maximal precordial motion occurs subsequent aortic valve opening
impulse falls away ejection blood
ventricular enlargement hypertrophy often alter area myocardium abuts chest wall cause impulse
left ventricular enlargement septum rotates medially anterolateral wall ventricle constitutes apex
right ventricle enlarges may cause apical impulse
ventricular contraction causes left ventricle move downward laterally counterclockwise right ventricular motion anterior medial clockwise
motion detected examiner differentiate right left ventricular impulse
finger sensitive amplitude motion frequency vibration
general outward pulsations better palpated observed whereas reverse true inward motion
low frequency vibrations associated diastolic filling abnormalities auscultated third fourth heart sounds often observed palpated auscultated
precordial impulses observed palpated consideration location size character includes duration force contour
normal apex impulse less cm diameter localized within midclavicular line brief duration lasts less two thirds systole palpated tap upon fingertip
location least reliable characteristic measure many patients normal hearts impulses lateral midclavicular line
furthermore left lateral decubitus position essential examination almost invariably rotates apex laterally
diameter palpated impulse less cm supine left lateral positions
size greater cm indicative left ventricular hypertrophy enlargement

apex impulse generally peaks within first third systole returned baseline time systole two thirds complete sensed tap palpator
sustained thrust timed last throughout systole suggests enlarged hypertrophied ventricle
degree thrust subjective accuracy examination proportional examiner experience interest
increased amplitude seen excitable states caused fever anxiety anemia hyperthyroidism
increased amplitude also found enlarged hypertrophied ventricles capable vigorous contraction
contour also important figure
apex generally observed palpated single systolic outward motion
double systolic impulses often present hypertrophic cardiomyopathy left bundle branch block
early diastolic impulse correspond auscultated third heart sound found normal hearts young thin patients dilated ventricles chronic heart failure volume overload states
extra impulse late diastole occurs atrial contraction corresponds auscultation fourth heart sound observed hypertrophied noncompliant ventricles example patients systemic hypertension aortic hypertension aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy angina pectoris
patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often triple apical impulse pulsation late diastole two systole
rarely quadruple impulse present rapid ventricular filling early diastole also appreciated
systolic retraction apex followed diastolic expansion described constrictive pericarditis
unless timing systole diastole corroborated finding mistaken normal
systolic retraction may also occur apical area prominent parasternal lift right ventricular hypertrophy
apical impulse must interpreted proper context patient
example tapping cm midclavicular impulse obese patient obstructive pulmonary disease may represent severe left ventricular hypertrophy enlargement apex rarely discernible patients
alternatively thin person straight back pectus excavatum may lateral forceful impulse entirely normal heart
slight outward pulsation occasionally present children thin adults normal hearts
generally however left parasternal impulse caused dilated hypertrophied right ventricle
dilated right ventricle often associated excess volume impulse may vigorous brief whereas impulse hypertrophied right ventricle sustained
common condition associated right ventricular dilatation functional tricuspid regurgitation less frequent causes include right ventricular infarction atrial septal defect pulmonic insufficiency ventricular septal defect
systolic thrill left lower sternal border characteristic latter condition
right ventricular hypertrophy generally secondary pulmonary disease severe chronic left ventricular failure
less common causes include mitral stenosis pulmonary stenosis primary hypertension pulmonary artery veins
severe mitral regurgitation may cause precordial pulsation absence pulmonary hypertension
impulse tends peak late systole caused regurgitant flow left atrium expanding lifting anterior right ventricle chest wall
pulsation second left intercostal space normal found children young thin adults
distinguished discrete tap often felt closure pulmonic valve
sustained impulse found numerous causes pulmonary hypertension
briefer forceful impulse found high volume states pulmonary artery dilatation
pulsation sternoclavicular joint important subtle finding dissecting aneurysm
types aortic disease proximal dilatation rarely cause pulsation
ectopic systolic pulsations frequently found medial superior apex
dyskinetic e g bulge outward systole caused left ventricular aneurysm
transient dyskinesis occur myocardial ischemia
patients severely dilated left ventricles often diffuse rocking apex impulse feels dyskinetic although true aneurysm absent
