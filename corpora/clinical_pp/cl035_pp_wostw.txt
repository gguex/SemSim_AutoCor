dyspnea uncomfortable abnormal awareness breathing
number different sensations experienced patients probably included category
dyspnea common cause respiratory limitation activity patients pulmonary disease
dyspnea subjective symptom reported patients
always sensation expressed patient confused rapid breathing tachypnea excessive breathing hyperpnea hyperventilation
dyspnea frequently described shortness breath inability take deep breath chest tightness
good history necessary separate truly dyspneic sensation dysphoric sensations experienced chest chest tightness caused myocardial ischemia
exertional dyspnea must separated exertional fatigue weakness
history dyspnea obtained detailed study important evaluating differential diagnosis
differential diagnosis dyspnea includes number pulmonary cardiac diseases well neuromuscular diseases chest wall anxiety
information obtained every patient dyspnea outlined table
history generally allow pursuing reasonable path toward making diagnosis
quantification dyspnea also important judging severity prognosis underlying disease
dyspnea may limiting symptom may responsible economic social disabilities
dyspnea like pain subjective symptom frequently influenced state mind patient
spite patients good association exists severity underlying disease complaint expressed patient
although physical findings directly relate complaint dyspnea several things may seen dyspneic patients
dyspneic patients frequently breathe rapidly shallowly
accessory muscles respiration may used supraclavicular intercostal retractions may seen
cardiac pulmonary neuromuscular examinations receive particular attention patients dyspnea
chest radiograph frequently helpful evaluating patients dyspnea
characteristic roentgenographic findings occur patients congestive heart failure pneumonia pulmonary fibrosis
chest radiograph may also abnormal patients obstructive pulmonary disease chest film neither sensitive specific detection airflow obstruction major abnormalities chest film seen patients far advanced obstructive pulmonary disease
laboratory use detection dyspnea may great value differential diagnosis quantifying severity underlying disorder
pulmonary function tests useful detection obstructive restrictive diseases lung chest wall
vital capacity forced expiratory volume second fev obtained simple spirometry usually correlate well sensation dyspnea patients lung disease
sophisticated expensive tests frequently unnecessary
arterial blood gas studies generally performed dyspneic patients limited usefulness evaluating dyspnea
good correlation severity hypoxemia severity dyspnea
arterial blood gases therefore useful quantifying severity gas exchange abnormalities patients established pulmonary dysfunction
depending findings obtained history physical examination laboratory testing cardiac function neuromuscular function may useful making diagnosis
occasionally patients require sophisticated testing including exercise testing gas exchange measurements measurements pulmonary compliance measurements respiratory muscle strength respiratory neurologic drive
none measurements actually aids detection dyspnea may value explaining quantifying dyspnea patient
dyspnea difficult subject study laboratory detected measured subjective reporting conscious people
number ways produce uncomfortable respiratory sensations normal people
include breathing devices increased resistance chest wall restriction produced elastic wrapping
addition everyone develops uncomfortable irresistible urge breathe following prolonged breath holding
somewhat similar sensation may produced preventing sighing occasional deep breathing normal subjects
rapid elevation arterial carbon dioxide tension produces uncomfortable respiratory sensation accompanied headache normal subjects
sensations produced normal people experiments probably even though frequently lumped single category dyspnea
similarly probable patients complaints dyspnea identical sensations
dyspnea common complaint patients obstructive restrictive pulmonary disorders
addition patients chest wall abnormalities kyphoscoliosis patients neuromuscular disease frequently complain dyspnea
mechanisms various dyspneic sensations completely clear
diseases associated dyspnea accompanied abnormality pulmonary mechanics subsequent increase overall work breathing
increased work breathing may due increase elastic work restrictive disease resistive work obstructive disease
conscious perception dyspnea probably results complicated interrelationship peripheral receptors neural pathways central nervous system
peripheral receptors commonly implicated include receptors chest wall associated respiratory muscle spindles receptors pulmonary parenchyma receptors central airways chemoreceptors carotid body
connecting neural pathways include vagi afferent neurons spinal cord
central neural mechanisms include central chemoreceptors inspiratory neurons medulla higher cortical centers
whenever mechanisms produce overall respiratory pattern increased requirement ventilation balanced expected increase respiratory output sensation abnormal breathing occurs
respiratory output way inappropriate ventilation requirements conscious sensation inappropriateness results sensation dyspnea
interest dyspnea generally experienced normal subjects subjected progressive arterial hypoxemia
subjects exposed reduced oxygen tensions generally demonstrate progressive central nervous system dysfunction complain difficulty breathing
hypoxemia undoubtedly contributes dyspnea patients preexisting pulmonary dysfunction stimulating respiration increasing ventilation probably directly produce sensation dyspnea
