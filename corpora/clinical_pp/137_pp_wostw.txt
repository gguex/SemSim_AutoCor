body size habitus describe physical characteristics individual include considerations physique general bearing body build
historically attempts made classify humans discrete somatotypes mesomorphicmuscular athletic endomorphicrounded stout ectomorphictall thin relate habitus propensity disease e g habitus apoplectus
terms little clinical relevance today body size habitus said encompass quantifiable measurements height weight body proportions skinfold thickness mid upper arm circumference
measurements true normal abnormal values must interpreted context individual age sex clinical status previous measurements
values plotted percentile reference population percentage ideal value
height length plantar surface foot crown head
heights fall rd percentile th percentile may require investigation
weight total weight body
weights greater ideal suggest obesity weights less ideal may indicate severe malnutrition
body proportions include trunk limb ratio arm span
trunk upper segment represented distance symphysis pubis crown head
lower segment distance symphysis pubis plantar surface foot represents limb contribution total height
birth normal upper lower segment ratio
legs grow rapidly trunk age segments equal remain adults
arm span distance tips middle fingers arms fully extended
adults arm span equal height
mid upper arm measurements taken midpoint acromial process olecranon process
skinfold thickness site measure subcutaneous fat used estimate total adiposity
obesity indicated value greater mm men mm women
severe depletion energy stores indicated values th percentile
mid upper arm circumference used calculate midupper arm muscle circumference
muscle circumferences less th percentile suggest severe depletion protein stores
accurate measurement height requires firm horizontal surface measuring tape attached true vertical surface movable block right angles vertical surface brought make contact scalp
unsteady base flexible bar office scales limit accuracy
subject stand bare feet heels together back straight possible
outer canthus eye horizontal plane external auditory meatus headpiece brought crown head
body weight measured beam scales nondetachable weights

insurance data represent sample selected group healthy middle class individuals
average weight sample less average found representative cross sectional studies
general obesity readily diagnosed examination naked patient
height weight tables despite limitations provide useful reference standards several studies shown increased mortality weights greater actuarial ideal weights
use determining weight goals tempered clinical judgment
patients hyperlipidemia hypertension non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus may increased percentage body fat may benefit weight loss despite weights within reference range
may also group healthy obese persons frequently strong family histories obesity obese past managed reduce weight maintain level fat cell size normal identifiable risk factors callaway
persons would unlikely benefit efforts weight reduction
wide variation body size comparison weight reference standard may less useful assessing adequacy caloric intake determining percentage usual body weight rate weight loss
weights less usual evidence significant malnutrition
almost one half body fat distributed subcutaneous fat
thickness layer bears relationship total body fat loss subcutaneous fat occurs proportionately dieting measurement skinfold thickness relatively simple practical method determining extent fatness
triceps sub scapular skinfolds commonly used age specific tables derived cross sectional studies provide reference values measurement sum
presence obesity usually obvious excessive weights moderate degrees overweight may due increased muscularity e g football players
skin fold thickness may used supplement weight height measurements
measurement body fat also useful estimate duration severity inadequate dietary intake fat lost slowly malnutrition
mid upper arm muscle circumference reliable index skeletal protein mass
take account bone nonmuscle tissues skinfold shape arm useful comparative measurement standards developed
measurement subject lack reproducibility observers
addition applying standards derived healthy populations overestimate protein calorie malnutrition
hospitalized patients often chronic illness may result disuse denervation atrophy subsequent loss muscle mass despite adequate protein stores
laboratory assessment nutritional status may include determinations serum albumin transferrin creatinine height index total lymphocyte count skin tests cell mediated immunity
tests suffer lack specificity

growth proceeds nonlinear fashion greatest rate immediately birth
general deceleration throughout childhood except small mid childhood growth spurt prominent adolescent growth spurt epiphyses close maximum height attained
regulation growth complex incompletely understood phenomenon genetic hormonal environmental influences
although racial differences exist clear much differences environmentally determined
hormonal influences growth outlined
thyroid hormone appears moderate growth regulating synthesis secretion growth hormone well permissive action effects growth hormone
thyroid hormone necessary develop normal adult proportions
growth hormone increases chondrogenesis protein synthesis cell profileration
growth promoting actions may mediated somatomedins
insulin acts primarily preserve metabolic homeostasis necessary growth rather direct growth stimulator
glucocorticoid oversecretion inhibit growth apparently direct effect target tissues rather inhibiting growth hormone actions release
androgens complementary action growth hormone potent growth stimulators pre puberty
however also accelerate epiphyseal maturity
administration androgens may lead early epiphyseal closure loss growth potential
hypogonadism may cause delay closure result long limb length
estrogens inhibitory effect linear growth stimulatory effect epiphyseal maturity
estrogens may inhibit somatomedin secretion
obesity defined actuarial ideal weight cross sectional surveys indicate men women united states overweight

obesity prevalent women men particularly women lower socioeconomic status

summarizes health consequences obesity
although obesity results intake calories excess energy expended undoubtedly genetic metabolic endocrine behavioral influences
onset obesity early life results hyperplasia fat cells may lead intractable form obesity
emotional disorders maladaptive eating patterns may also contribute weight gain
although patients frequently believe weight gain must due glandular problem endocrine disorders infrequently identified
thorough history including dietary history physical appropriate patients presenting obesity endocrine studies reserved patients features suggestive primary endocrine disorder see table
protein calorie malnutrition present alarming number seriously ill hospitalized patients prevalence high surveys
malnutrition may contribute poor wound healing decreased immune competence increased susceptibility sepsis hypoventilation decreased tolerance chemotherapy delayed ambulation
many illnesses predispose patients malnutrition
common mechanism decreased nutritional intake may related appetite loss associated illness drugs surgical procedures gastrointestinal disorders swallowing problems impaired ability self feed secondary neurologic psychiatric illness
addition illnesses malabsorption protein losing enteropathies diabetes nephrotic syndrome may result increased loss nutrients
hypermetabolic state associated major illness also increase protein calorie requirements
cancers may cause malnutrition mechanisms addition may independent effects metabolic processes
marasmus kwashiorkor like syndromes may present malnourished patients
marasmus seen prolonged starvation total dietary intake inadequate
often seen severe chronic illnesses patients generally recognizable weight loss muscle wasting loss fat deposits general cachectic appearance
kwashiorkor like malnutrition occurs diet contains ample calories little protein e g prolonged administration dextrose containing intravenous fluids
acute depletion obesity may present skeletal mass may slightly depleted
laboratory tests visceral proteins immune competence usually depressed
malnutrition may also seen outpatients chronically ill alcoholic well elderly individuals children inadequate diets
anorexia nervosa eating disorders may result life threatening malnutrition
