physical diagnosis origins grecian medicine
clinical medicine flourished greeks especially egypt crete babylonia undoubtedly greeks influenced earlier physicians
writings countries become part mainstream western civilization greeks
table
contains two quotations illustrate level medicine practiced greeks
took careful history practiced direct auscultation
masters observation descriptions patients could fit modern texts without much change
greek medicine flourished early
homer iliad ca b c
described wounds used anatomic terms
hippocrates ca b c
lived golden age greece
contemporaries included plato socrates aeschylus sophocles euripides aristophanes pericles
medicine became hands art science profession major
hippocratic writings probably collection number individuals including master period dominant medical figure
collected death hippocrates stored alexandria
disseminated parts civilized world
surviving collection contains clinical cases likes encountered years
cases demonstrate high level medicine included careful history inspection palpation direct auscultation examination sputum urine
enduring contribution hippocratic school conviction disease natural divine
consider remarks epilepsy thus regard disease called sacred appears wise divine sacred diseases natural cause originates like affections delp manning
major conceptual leap
natural phenomena studied course predicted
concept necessary prerequisite development physical diagnosis
greeks develop accurate knowledge human anatomy pathology
dissection human bodies occur except brief time alexandria third century b c
greeks concept nosology
felt disease caused imbalance four humors body blood yellow bile black bile phlegm

next great greek physician hippocrates galen caa
born pergamum
spent professional life rome becoming physician emperor marcus aurelius
prolific author
many works lost surviving ones fill twenty two volumes
studied wrote extensively anatomy based upon pigs monkeys
first experimental physiologist
supplemented findings speculation
written work accepted ultimate truth time vesalius
enshrinement knowledge much incorrect hampered medical progress next years
andreas vesalius founded modern anatomy publication de humanis corporis fabrica structure human body june
book based upon personal dissection human bodies
represented remarkable departure zoological anatomy galen
accomplishments vesalius possible resumption dissection human bodies began thirteenth century
human dissection rare thirteenth century
egyptians knew body organs extracting tiny incisions made purposes embalming
continuing controversy human dissection hippocratic period
knowledge anatomy except skeleton scanty corpus hippocraticum
consensus human dissection practiced hippocratic period either reverence human body belief life death required intact body
dissection purpose acquiring knowledge human body probably originated alexandria egypt fourth century b c years hippocrates
herophilus studied nervous system gastrointestinal tract describing cerebrum cerebellum meninges fourth ventricle brain duodenum eye
counted pulse water clock analyzed rate rhythm
erasistratus ca b c
described aortic pulmonic valves chordae tendineae heart
clearly saw heart pump although direction circulation backward
practice human dissection antiquity confined largely alexandria
dissection apparently occurred rome second century must sparse
galen
said alexandria studied place anatomy could learned
good evidence galen practiced human dissection
human dissection began thirteenth century bologna one great medieval universities continued uninterrupted present time
several occurrences early thirteenth century set stage lifting taboo disturbing human body
emperor frederic ii issued imperial decree authorizing performance public anatomes bodies executed criminals teaching purposes
legend frederick ii also stomachs two subjects opened order determine digestion enhanced exercise rest
another sign relaxation concept sanctity human body thirteenth century practice dismembering bodies crusaders boiling parts bones could returned families europe burial
specific reason resumption human dissection probably legal scholars university bologna famous law school
scholars concerned know causes deaths legal reasons

work much influence upon contemporary medicine detailed nosologies following system appeared various countries
nosologies however appreciably influence practice medicine
differences nosologists eighteenth century sydenham merely catalogued arranged symptoms characterized diseases
sydenham delineated disease manifestations clinical course
succeeding nosologists classified symptoms
distinction symptom disease appreciated
next advance development discipline pathologic anatomy morgagni described
morgagni established concept whole organs diseased
philippe pinel paris published nosologie philosophique
book stressed importance arriving typical picture disease ignoring varying picture individual patient
characterized diseases divided classes orders genera species
grouped diseases involved particular tissue together diseases mucous membranes
entirely new concept
previous authors arranged disorders according anatomic location heart lungs etc
bichat expanded upon idea showed disease type tissue could give rise two different kinds symptoms

morbid anatomy origins alongside descriptive anatomy
first known forensic autopsy done bologna also mondino started descriptive anatomy klemperer
body individual named azzolino examined authorities felt death suspicious
visceral congestion found authorities investigated
great descriptive anatomists time quite interested morbid anatomy
bodies executed criminals dissected teaching purposes anatomia publica bodies individuals died disease also examined anatomia privata
vesalius inquired carefully history bodies dissected planned publish records apparently lost destroyed
many great physicians anatomists early strongly advocated autopsies means furthering clinical medicine
johannes schenck von grafenberg collected pathologic reports preceding years well experiences seven volumes
book classified index collection aphorisms designed arouse interest pathology
wilhelm fabry von hilden physician bern wrote book called attention learned autopsies
noted germany behind france italy medicine fewer autopsies performed germany
public apparently willing support autopsies fact often requested done relatives order determine cause death
situation british colonies north america mirrored europe
cotton mather boston described congenital rectal atresia autopsy done son
copenhagen bartholin given permission authorities perform autopsies patients died public hospitals
bartholin gave detail methods permission autopsies could obtained well techniques gaining information looking previously existing surgical incision inspecting bodies embalmed
recommended deception could used advocated caution tact klemperer

statements history really remarkable
important ask questions patients help questions one know exactly things concern disease one neat disease better
one start interrogating patient
one learn sane troubled patient degree strength weakness patient
one obtain certain notion disease process body site affected
one conclude spirit mind good shape patient responds suitable manner faithful memory
sign delirium ask one question patient replies another forgets saying talks
physician interrogate patient first question relatives friends especially learn patient
important beginning find precisely disease process began
ask rapidity manifestations diseasewhether damaging phenomena develop rapidly contrary arrive progress slowly
ask disease present patient previously
believe important informed nature disease individual patient formed fashion differ markedly one another many respects

modern view history probably began french school corvisart laennec louis andral keele
responsible nearly told might termed modern clinical method
boerhaave exemplified best time french noted previously made rounds students beds day questioning inspecting patient examining urine feces going autopsy table patient died
next great step french school exemplified martinet
louis martinet published manual pathology containing symptoms diagnosis morbid characters diseases together exposition different methods examination applicable affections head chest abdomen
preface martinet states intends book clinical guide containing brief statement necessary requisites proper conduct clinical pursuits
martinet clinical examination scheme fills seventy four pages small book
martinet begins book exposition various methods examination used medicine
selected quotations
bedside patient observer must study disease see true character stripped false shades frequently disguised books
physician calm conciliating hear attention communications patients make put questions mildness listen kindly complaints never fail demonstrate active interest welfare
drawing case always recollected done view convey others exact representation facts observed
report case like copy picture
leading symptoms particularly serve establish diagnosis first noted ranged according importance reference always made far done order appearance
may however sometimes useful note absence particular symptoms usually exist similar cases lest omission may attributed negligence forgetfulness part observer discredit cast facts detailed
observations transcribed immediately visit book kept purpose means ensuring correctness statements
commencing take case first note name sex age occupation patient done according form given
cases becomes necessary state country district patient conies diseases prevail
acute chronic forms disease require plan examination narration altogether different
everything connected previous history known stated fully chronic cases means throwing light obscurity generally surrounds
acute cases far less necessary
martinet quain translation
martinet history begins taking full history applicable diseases uses special methods three great cavities bodythe brain chest abdomen keele
history comes physical examination
stethoscope used percussion chest

engel say meagerness historical record
particularly bothered record sparse
eliciting historical accounts experiences others means gaining knowledge course old man
also quintessentially human one ways learn early childhood stories others tell known unfamiliar us
reason suspect process history taking recently thought anything needed taught even studied much less scientific method
yet science scientific represent man persistent effort extend organize knowledge reasoned efforts ultimately depend evidence consensually validated charles odegaard said history taking interviewing qualify scientific method
even rufus ephesus appeared know intuitively
thus recommends asking questions order physicians know exactly things concern disease suitable manner patient response faithful memory recommends verification questioning relatives friends advises physician find precisely

teaching senior physicians acting role models bedside
rare exceptions verbatim accounts history students rarely ever actually observed critiqued history
didactic material ask found albeit sparsely physical diagnosis texts manuals physical examination
questions given examples highly specific ever tuberculosis
circumscribed attention social circumstances
martinet next real advance history taking came publication clinical interview felix deutsch william murphy
book based part upon reviewing transcribed tapes psychiatric resident interviews patients period years
process interview received detailed attention
examiner allows patient talk without asking leading questions answering questions patient usually give detailed account complaints ideas illness
exhausted ideas recollections regarding organic disturbances stop wait asked question
examiner waits feels patient continue spontaneously repeats one points patient last sentence interrogative form
usually therapist repeats one somatic complaints last mentioned careful use wording patient
patient rule gives new information centering around symptoms stimulated associations
