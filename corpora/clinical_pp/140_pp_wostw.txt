ketone bodies acetoacetic acid beta hydroxybutyric acid acetone insignificant blood urine normal individuals postprandial overnight fasted state
however ketoacids become important sources metabolic energy circumstances availability glucose restricted prolonged fasting ability use glucose greatly diminished decompensated diabetes mellitus
prolonged starvation arterial concentrations metabolically active strong organic acids increase approximately fold mm significantly higher levels mm diabetic ketoacidosis
mechanisms responsible development ketonemia increased production liver decreased peripheral utilization muscle reduced volume distribution
since ketone bodies bound plasma proteins freely filterable solutes renal glomerulus appear quantifiably tubular urine
low plasma concentrations ketone bodies encountered normally overnight fast urinary excretion rates negligible
plasma levels increase beyond
mm however excretion increases measurable amounts ketone bodies appear urine
two semiquantitative tests available rapid determination primarily acetoacetate urine blood although never considered totally satisfactory blood
ferric chloride test performed adding drops freshly voided urine drops solution ferric chloride
first precipitate ferric phosphate forms additional drops urine precipitate disappears burgundy red color appears
intensity color judged
assay measures acetoacetate sensitivity less mgdl
unfortunately drugs salicylates antipyrines well phenols acetates cyanates cause false positive results
overcome sample boiled minutes remove unstable acetoacetate causes red color disappear
preferable repeat test previously boiled urine sample
sodium nitroprusside reaction measures acetone acetoacetate hydroxybutyrate biological materials

samples containing mgdl acetoacetate judged large large mgdl mgdl
ketostix test accurate urines tested high specific gravity
low ph
highly pigmented urine specimens may yield false positive readings
levodopa also cause false positive result
ketostix strips less sensitive acetest tablets high degree variability lots
acetest sensitivity mgdl range preferable method
several methods available measuring ketone bodies
isolation purification enzyme hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase became possible develop sensitive highly specific enzymatic assay acetoacetate hydroxybutyrate
enzyme catalyzes redox reaction
recently fluorometric techniques automated colorimetric method developed analysis enzymatic methods described determination acetoacetate
finally kobayashi co workers developed gas chromatographic method determination acetone acetoacetate urine
speculate method could easily adapted measure hydroxybutyrate well following quantified oxidation acetoacetate
ketones commonly detected accelerated adipose tissue triglyceride hydrolysis increased hepatic fatty acid permeability across inner mitochondrial membrane produced decrease circulating insulin increased glucagon cause increased glycogen breakdown gluconeogenesis lipolysis fatty acid oxidation ketogenesis
normal individuals plasma ketone levels self limited mm concentrations greater insulin release stimulated thereby preventing ketoacidosis insulin limitation lipolysis availability free fatty acids hepatic oxidation
insulin dependent diabetic concentrations free fatty acids continue increase uncontrollably ketoacidosis ensues
addition fasting prolonged starvation uncontrolled diabetes ketonuria may observed physiologic conditions
acute alcoholism severe prolonged exercise may result ketonuria
ketone bodies may also detected urine third trimester pregnancy labor delivery immediate postpartum period occasionally lactation
ketogenesis may also increased neonate resulting significant ketonuria
clinical conditions characterized temporary decrease glucose availability increased glucose utilization elevated levels counterregulatory stress associated hormones cortisol epinephrine
reduce urinary loss important metabolic fuels furnish significant amount caloric requirements fasting kidney capable reabsorbing portion increased filtered load ketoacids
linear correlation found urinary excretion acetoacetate plasma concentration renal threshold exceeded
reports described similar linear relationship excretion hydroxybutyrate filtered load increases
elevated plasma levels ketone bodies mean fractional excretions
acetoacetate hydroxybutyrate respectively
thus ketone bodies appear completely reabsorbed renal tubules low plasma concentrations plasma levels rise filtered load ketone bodies increases significant ketonuria appears
net reabsorption rate remains directly proportional filtered load ketone bodies despite large increases plasma concentrations excretion rates approximately filtered load remain unchanged
recent evidence would support conclusion tubular maximum ketone bodies exceeds high filtered loads seen studies starvation
since excretory rates relatively unchanged reabsorption rates must therefore increase
mechanisms increase reabsorption rate unknown shown reabsorption rates altered reduction extravascular volume sodium balance accompany starvation decompensated diabetes
studies rat demonstrated initial decrease fractional reabsorption hydroxybutyrate concentrations decline hydroxybutyrate concentration raised higher levels
data may suggest saturable nonsaturable renal transport systems hydroxybutyrate
maximal transport rate saturable component achieved arterial concentration approximately
mm
although renal utilization hydroxybutyrate rises increasing arterial levels ketoacid affect net reabsorption rate
reabsorption rates hydroxybutyrate always exceed utilization
humans excretion rate acetoacetate rat directly proportional filtration rate
maximal rate observed indicating nonsaturable mechanism reabsorption acetoacetate also present kidney
reabsorption acetoacetate decreased increasing levels hydroxybutyrate indicating common competitive tubular transport mechanism
acetoacetate released kidney blood increasing hydroxybutyrate utilization simultaneous net utilization acetoacetate kidney
tended increase rising concentrations arterial acetoacetate
evidence lower levels acetoacetate reabsorption higher rates utilization sustained cellular uptake peritubular blood
finally membrane vesicles isolated brush border rat kidney known contain sodium gradient dependent carrier system transports ketone bodies osmotically reactive space
carrier demonstrates reciprocal inhibition acetoacetate hydroxybutyrate accelerated exchange diffusion saturation competitive inhibition lack ouabain sensitivity
renal utilization ketoacids accounts approximately turnover infused ketone bodies
thus oxidative metabolism accounts major fraction measured renal clearance ketone bodies blood
prolonged starvation calculated renal reabsorption ketone bodies spares approximately k calday would otherwise lost urine
consumed kidney rest released utilization central nervous system glucose deprivation
ability kidney reabsorb ketone bodies also preserves sodium potassium ammonium ion since urinary electroneutrality equimolar excretion cations required loss anions
first days fasting throughout course diabetic ketoacidosis sodium potassium lost excretion ketone bodies
starvation continues obligate cation accompanying ketone bodies becomes ammonium ion
reabsorption ketone bodies therefore spares calories also ammonium nitrogen conserving least g nitrogen per day
poorly controlled decompensated diabetes mellitus common pathologic condition causing ketonuria
result routine testing urine ketones diabetics universally employed hospitals outpatients assess adequacy diabetes control determine insulin dosage periods loss control
widespread availability self blood glucose monitoring superiority method urine testing glucose monitor diabetic control deemphasized importance hence frequency testing ketone bodies urine
serious omission blood glucose level per se diagnostic life threatening ketoacidosis
although necessary test every urine specimen ketonuria hyperglycemia almost level associated intercurrent illness stress demands urine ketone testing
many cases advanced ketoacidosis gone undiagnosed progressed serious states health care professionals well patients abandoned urine testing glucosuria ketonuria well
presence absence ketonuria also useful clinical classifications fasting hypoglycemia infancy childhood
absence ketone bodies evidence excess insulin secretion associated beta cell neoplasia whereas ketonuria suggests lack fuel availability
however caution required generalizations discriminatory test may inaccurate unreliable
cases hyperinsulinism plasma levels ketone bodies may suppressed sufficiently low prevent ketonuria
rationale based action insulin suppress ketogenesis used serve rough indicator occurrence nocturnal hypoglycemia insulin requiring diabetic patient
severe glucosuria without mild ketonuria upon arising considered evidence rebound hyperglycemia following insulin induced hypoglycemia somogyi effect
problems low renal threshold ketone bodies high sensitivity nitroprusside test problems mixing urine within bladder may make clinical judgment unreliable
excessive intake ethanol also frequent cause ketonuria
often use associated recent chronic lack sufficient nutrients simulating state acute chronic starvation
addition metabolism ethanol inhibits gluconeogenesis
consequently instances relative hypoglycemia insulinopenia although ethanol found stimulate insulin secretion directly combined sucrose ingestion
