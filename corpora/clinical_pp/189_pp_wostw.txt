three major conditions affect prostate gland benign prostatic hypertrophy prostatitis prostatic cancer
hypertrophy prostate occurs primarily medial lateral lobes

prostatitis may acute chronic bacterial abacterial
abacterial prostatitis sometimes referred prostatosis
acute bacterial prostatitis accompanied irritative urinary symptoms dysuria frequency urgency
fever may significant
prostatic examination limited making diagnosis since setting prostatic massage may lead considerable morbidity including septicemia
prostatitis may evaluated three glass test described chapter hematuria

sixty cases show local extension distinct metastases
hence early diagnosis treatment imperative best facilitated obtaining biopsy early course suspected abnormalities prostate
