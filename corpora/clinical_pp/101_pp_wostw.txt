hundreds proteins dissolved plasma
measuring concentration proteins clinician obtain information regarding disease states different organ systems
measurement protein done serum fluid remains plasma clotted thus removing fibrinogen clotting factors
total protein content provides information regarding patient general status clinically useful data obtained fractionating total protein
normal serum protein level gdl
albumin makes
gdl remainder total globulins
values may vary according individual laboratory
widely used method measuring serum protein biuret reaction
principle reaction serum proteins react copper sulfate sodium hydroxide form violet biuret complex
intensity violet color proportional concentration protein
albumin generally measured dye binding technique utilizes ability albumin form stable complex bromocresol green dye
bcg albumin complex absorbs light different wavelength unbound dye
method may overestimate albumin binding proteins
total globulin fraction generally determined subtracting albumin total protein
electrophoresis common means fractionating serum proteins
process protein solutions appropriate buffered solvents placed medium paper starch blocks exposed electrical current
differences electrical charge cause protein components migrate different rates toward anode cathode
immunoelectrophoresis used evaluate increase gamma fraction
specific antisera immunoglobulin type used determine whether increase monoclonal e composed one immunoglobulin type polyclonal e due increase number many different immunoglobulins
albumin makes half total protein present serum
approximately body total albumin pool found intravascular compartment
remainder extravascular located interstitial spaces mainly muscles skin
albumin also found small amounts variety body tissue fluids sweat tears gastric juice bile
albumin diffuse freely intact vascular endothelium
hence major protein providing critical colloid osmotic oncotic pressure regulates passage water diffusable solutes capillaries
albumin accounts colloid osmotic pressure
exerts greater osmotic force accounted solely basis number molecules dissolved plasma reason completely replaced inert substances dextran
reason albumin negative charge normal blood ph attracts retains cations especially na vascular compartment
called gibbs donnan effect
albumin also binds small number cl ions increase negative charge ability retain na ions inside capillaries
enhanced osmotic force causes colloid osmotic pressure greater would protein concentration alone
albumin serves transport bilirubin hormones metals vitamins drugs
important role fat metabolism binding fatty acids keeping soluble form plasma
one reason hyperlipemia occurs clinical situations hypoalbuminemia
binding hormones albumin regulates amount free hormone available time
negative charge albumin also able furnish anions needed balance cations plasma
albumin synthesized liver
rate synthesis constant normal individuals mgkgday resulting production g albumin daily kg man
liver produces albumin less half capacity
primary factors affecting albumin synthesis include protein amino acid nutrition colloidal osmotic pressure action certain hormones disease states
fasting protein deficient diet cause decrease albumin synthesis long deficiency state maintained
normal individual liver increases albumin synthesis response increased availability amino acids provided portal blood following protein containing meal
decrease extravascular colloidal pressure serves stimulus albumin synthesis thought act within liver
thyroid hormone corticosteroids growth hormone insulin increase albumin synthesis
main site albumin degradation known
albumin appears catabolized locations capable rapid equilibration bloodstream
degraded amino acids utilized energy requirements cell secreted pool extracellular amino acids
globulin fraction includes hundreds serum proteins including carrier proteins enzymes complement immunoglobulins
synthesized liver although immunoglobulins synthesized plasma cells
globulins divided four groups electrophoresis
four fractions b g depending migratory pattern anode cathode
increases globulin fraction usually result increase immunoglobulins increase proteins pathologic states characteristic electrophoretic patterns see figures

immunoglobulins e antibodies migrate mainly g region migrate b regions well
immunoglobulin molecule composed two heavy chains class two light chains also alike
heavy chain variable region amino acid substitutes make chain different next constant region amino acid differences constant region immunoglobulin heavy chain type
light chains either l k type constant variable regions
different kinds immunoglobulins named capital letters correspond heavy chain type igg iga igm ige igd
three fourths immunoglobulin level normal serum igg type
many antibodies bacteria viruses igg
normal collection igg molecules made minute amounts different igg antibodies produced diverse clones plasma cells thus polyclonal
single clone escapes normal controls reproduce excessively synthesize excess monoclonal protein single heavy chain class light chain type
clinical situation causes elevation serum albumin acute dehydration
variety clinical entities result decreased albumin level either depressed synthesis increased losses
decrease albumin synthesis caused end stage liver disease intestinal malabsorption syndromes protein calorie malnutrition
examples albumin loss nephrotic syndrome severe burns skin important extra storage pool albumin
consequence decrease serum albumin shift fluid intravascular interstitial space resulting intravascular volume depletion edema formation

haptoglobin rises response stress infection acute inflammation tissue necrosis probably stimulation synthesis
haptoglobin levels decrease hemolytic reaction haptoglobin complexes free hemoglobin cleared circulation
