viscera innervated sympathetic parasympathetic fibers ans controls activity cardiovascular respiratory gastrointestinal genitourinary systems effects smooth muscle blood vessels sweat glands endocrine system
provides mechanism influences end organs chemical transmitters catecholamines sympathetic acetylcholine parasympathetic nerve endings
centrally acetylcholine monoamines several peptides hypothalamus brainstem may modulate system
sweating provoked increasing body core temperature indicating efferent sympathetic sudomotor pathway intact
diabetes sweating initially lost distally first feet progresses proximally
core temperature raised °c period minutes different ways using heat cradle hot bath simple immersion hand hot water
variation methods trunk heated briefly electric lamp source without increasing core temperature
normally sweating occur within minutes without patchiness provided sweat glands present
sweating quantified coating area tested quinizarin powder cobalt chloride solution iodine solution starch skin conductivity measurements using starch iodine paper
sweating occur significance finding enhanced demonstrating sweat glands actually present area tested

skin vasodilation tested using plethysmography record hand blood flow
exposure chest wall radiant heat skin vasodilation occurs probably due reduction sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity
ans strong influence cardiovascular system controlling heart rate blood pressure
sympathetic efferent fibers capacitance resistance vessels muscles splanchnic area kidneys affecting renin release represent important mechanisms preventing hypotension
sympathetic parasympathetic efferents control heart rate vagus altering rate beat beat sympathetic provides gradual cardioaccelerator effect
tests cardiovascular system divided testing parasympathetic function response heart rate deep breathing valsalva maneuver standing others testing sympathetic function response blood pressure standing sustained hand grip stress tests
tests aortic carotid baroceptors also employed
normally heart rate varies continually increasing inspiration decreasing expiration sinus arrhythmia
variation abolished atropine uninfluenced propranolol
however isoproterenol also extent decreases beat beat variation normal subjects
therefore heart rate variation solely dependent parasympathetic activity although commonly used assessment limb ans
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy variation heart rate reduced even lost completely
heart rate variation measured easily provides simplest sensitive index autonomic damage
patient sits quietly breathes deeply breaths minute minute
electrocardiogram lead ii recorded throughout period deep breathing marker used indicate onset inspiration expiration
maximum heart rate inspiration minimum heart rate expiration calculated breath mean difference maximum minimum heart rate breaths represents result test
variation less beats per min definitely abnormal borderline normal result
valsalva maneuver deep inspiration patient performs forced expiration standardized resistance blood pressure falls heart rate increases breath released blood pressure rises overshoots original value heart rate slows
changes heart rate mediated vagus nerve post valsalva hypertension prevented sympathetic blockade
test performed patient sitting supine position blowing mouthpiece connected modified sphygmomanometer holding pressure mm hg seconds continuous egg lead ii recorded

standing hypotension normally prevented peripheral vasoconstriction mediated sympathetic efferents
therefore severe sympathetic damage postural hypotension results
test performed measuring blood pressure sphygmomanometer patient supine standing
fall systolic blood pressure less mm hg would normally expected
autonomic neuropathy fall mm hg found
sustained hand grip sharp rise blood pressure occurs due heart rate dependent increase cardiac output unchanged peripheral resistance
extensive sympathetic damage rise blood pressure abnormally small nonexistent
using hand grip dynamometer maximum voluntary contraction first determined maintained maximum long possible
blood pressure measured minute intervals hand grip

rise mm hg hand grip normally expected
stress tests mediated sympathetic efferent pathway cause vasoconstriction hypertension tachycardia
include sudden cortical arousal unexpected noise mental arithmetic cold pressor test hand immersed water °c seconds
tests well standardized ones described
aortic carotid baroceptors sense changes blood pressure sudden fall rise blood pressure followed reflex increase decrease heart rate predominantly vagal response
blood pressure raised briefly injecting phenylephrine intravenously
amyl nitrite inhalation nitroglycerine tablets used cause transient fall blood pressure
tests baroreflex arc used routinely interpretation individual results difficult
role vagus nerve ventilatoryrespiratory system undoubted therefore unexpected abnormalities may occur patient autonomic neuropathy outlined
however tests investigating aspects autonomic function still certain extent experimental nature
response carotid body chemoreceptors hypoxia autonomic neuropathy controversial although animals vagal blockade destruction carotid bodies abolishes increased rate breathing expected response hypoxemia
hand hyperventilation reduces pco leads cerebral vasoconstriction muscle vasodilatation fall blood pressure vasomotor center functioning normally
reflex vasoconstriction return blood pressure normal follow vasomotor center intact
bronchial airway tone mainly vagal control
patients autonomic neuropathy lose bronchodilatory effect occur response local cholinergic blockade show fall airway conductance provocation test cold air

pupil reciprocal innervation parasympathetic sympathetic systems
parasympathetic supply concerned constriction sympathetic dilation
long term diabetics abnormally small pupil diameters dark damage sympathetic innervation dilator muscles
light reflex appears normal pupil size taken account
spontaneous oscillations pupil size hippus observed normally also lost autonomic neuropathy
pupil abnormalities correlate abnormal cardiovascular tests indicative autonomic neuropathy
number tests described investigate pupillary responses localize neurologic damage
solution metacholine similar effects acetylcholine instilled eye normal pupil respond
parasympathetic damage constrictor muscles supersensitive metacholine cause pupillary constriction
neither epinephrine phenylephrine causes change normal pupil size
however sympathetic lesion dilation occurs due denervation hypersensitivity
homatropine normal pupil becomes widely dilated patient sympathetic damage dilation slight absent
cocaine leads dilation pupil sympathetic activity effect absent sympathetic damage occurs
defects hormone secretion response different stimuli appear definite component autonomic failure syndrome

several conditions impair autonomic function afferent efferent central components ans may affected separately together
disorders categorized systemic diseases e g diabetes mellitus alcoholism amyloidosis primary neurologic diseases e g tabes dorsalis parkinsonism idiopathic degenerative diseases e g progressive autonomic failure paf without associated neurologic disorders paf associated parkinson disease paf associated multiple system atrophy shy drager syndrome miscellaneous causes e g hypokalemia
conditions autonomic derangement secondary diabetes mellitus far common patients disease symptomatic commonly asymptomatic involvement determined clinical features andor sensitive tests
involvement autonomic nervous system may patchy distribution generally irreversible although symptoms may curiously intermittent
peripheral neuropathy usually also present patients autonomic neuropathy
symptomatic autonomic neuropathy diabetics associated bad prognosis according one estimate mortality reaching within year period
particular autonomic functions affected differ case case according end organ involved
although site lesion reflex arc afferent central efferent interest frequently difficult pinpoint always practical value identify
tests commonly performed investigate autonomic function take consideration different organ systems comprising ans
differ complexity simplest performed bedside
since organ body without autonomic innervation autonomic neuropathy represents multisystem disease
pattern involvement varies investigations chosen judiciously multitude tests described taking consideration patient presenting complaints
contrast cardiovascular tests lend best screening large numbers patients interpretation much easier tests thoroughly standardized
therefore diabetic patients screened autonomic neuropathy symptoms suggestive autonomic neuropathy following tests would appropriate

diabetic patients symptoms genitourinary tract gastrointestinal tract involvement appropriate tests described previous sections confirm indeed clinical problems secondary ans disease
progressive autonomic failure postural hypotension sympathetic lesion responsible
attempt localize lesion reflex arc afferent central efferent connections number tests may performed
vasoconstrictive response stress preserved afferent central lesion likely
sweating response rise body temperature defective lesion probably efferent
normal piloerection sweating intradermal acetylcholine indicates preganglionic lesion whereas defective response indicates postganglionic lesion
following postganglionic denervation supersensitivity vessels transmitter norepinephrine loss response tyramine
tests usually provide evidence efferent sympathetic lesion preganglionic progressive autonomic failure multiple system atrophy shy drager syndrome postganglionic progressive autonomic failure alone
investigating parasympatheticsympathetic innervation pupil best proceed follows
