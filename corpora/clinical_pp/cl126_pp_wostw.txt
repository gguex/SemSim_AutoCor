abnormalities involving skin cartilage bone eardrum may interfere hearing
rinne weber tuning fork tests used office evaluate hearing
weber test tuning fork usually hz activated applied skull forehead chin upper incisor teeth
normal response lateralization sound energy generated fork either ear
perceived patient middle head top head
abnormal patient vibrating fork perceived ear conductive hearing loss drum perforation impacted wax middle ear fluid stapes fixation otosclerosis provided ear normal
sensorineural dysfunction exists ears caused aging deafness presbycusis ototoxicity drugs acoustic trauma excess noise exposure following central nervous system infection vibrating fork perceived ear best sensorineural function
rinne test activated tuning fork held
cm ear placed mastoid process normal subject hear better louder distinctly front ear behind ear
proper notation ac bc indicates air conduction better bone conduction
patient abnormal hearing tuning fork activated held
cm ear placed mastoid process heard better behind ear
result written bc ac e bone conduction better air conduction
air conduction testing measures integrity entire hearing apparatus external ear auditory cortex
bone conduction testing measures integrity sensorineural structures cochlea eighth nerve brainstem nuclei relays auditory cortex
combination two tests permits examiner use fundamental physiologic information categorizing patient hearing within normal limits
examination auditory system includes visual inspection outer ear tuning fork tests
external examination pinna child years age pulled downward adequate visualization ear canal eardrum figure
adult pinna pulled upward backward figure
external ear must inspected carefully nodules growths serious injuries surgical scars cysts crusting fistulas
prominent protruding ears called lop ears commonly seen
pinna pulled firmly directions determine tenderness
tragus pushed determine tenderness
tuning fork tests examiner using rubber reflex hammer elbow strikes one tine strongly enough produce sound clearly perceived examiner cm

fork held firmly vertex skull midline firmly forehead chin upper incisors

probably exact referral incisor teeth
remove false teeth use upper gum
always remove patient wig using vertex
ask patient hear better right left ear

external ear system collects sound energy transmission ossicular chain malleus incus stapes thence fluids inner ear cochlea
obstruction flow energy system create hearing impairment
proper painless cleansing ear canal often necessary adequate inspection
canal innervated fibers cranial nerves v vii ix x thus exquisitely sensitive area
patients often cough examination ear branches tenth nerve arnold nerve stimulated
skin pinna canal drum subject disorders skin elsewhere body presence cerumen glands may lead special problems
wax normal substance left undisturbed patient physician unless removal needed accurate examination
long tubular nature ear canal predisposes infection saprophytic bacteria fungi especially moisture frequently present
inner two thirds ear canal bony outer third cartilaginous
cartilaginous canal freely movable accommodate examination instruments speculum
bony canal rigid tender thus speculum inserted cartilaginous portion
bony protrusions often obscure drum bulge auris monsauris
accurate visualization thus requires scope angled various directions
normal drum pale pink flesh color presence tiny vessels coursing primarily mucosal side
radial circular fibers compose middle layer drum
perforation disease healed area lacks fibers usually appears translucent mobile flaccid area
negative pressure middle ear eustachian tube obstruction exceedingly common particularly upper respiratory infections flying
retracted state drum prominent short malleus process increased opacity retained fluid middle ear must searched case
inflammation skin external ears ear canal common eczema otitis externa swimmer ear
may caused allergies infection saprophytic bacteria sometimes yeast fungus
ear canal must carefully cleaned adequate diagnosis
failure cleansing often cause misdiagnosis ear disease
tenderness moving pinna tragus usually indicates external canal inflammation
canal swelling exudate wax foreign bodies drum perforations may create conductive hearing loss see chapter
upper part drum must carefully inspected retractions perforations area lead serious ear mastoid disease cholesteatoma
fluid behind eardrum serous otitis media common children adults
basic cause eustachian tube obstruction
physical changes subtle must searched make accurate diagnosis decreased movement drum yellowish color fine reticular blood vessels drum prominent short process malleus
eardrum infant years age quite oblique examiner line vision junction canal drum often indistinct figure
canal edema inflammation may erroneously called drum middle ear disease also see chapter
hz fork preferred weber rinne tests intermediate range permits evaluation low tone hearing impairment without excessive vibratory sensation influencing response
higher pitched fork miss early conductive hearing losses lower pitched one test vibration predominantly
forks octave apart hzcan used manner evaluate losses higher frequencies
frequencies also used electronic audiometers permit recording audiogram graph hearing response
accurate fork testing permit clinician predict pattern patient audiogram
certain variations classical abnormal findings weber test may found
vibrating fork perceived ear severe conductive loss conductive dys function exists ears bilateral drum perforation bilateral impacted wax bilateral middle ear fluid bilateral stapes fixation
hearing loss mixed type conductive sensorineural rules unpredictable variable
generally speaking weber refer ear predominant conductive loss
rinne test normal subjects well sensorineural hearing loss ac bc
air conduction usually shortened time louder fork needed allow patient perceive air conduction sensorineural loss
nothing wrong patient conductive mechanisms external ear canal eardrum middle ear ossicular chain
therefore air conduction greater bone conduction air conduction loud enough overcome patient hearing loss threshold hearing
hearing impairment categorized conductive sensorineural loss
proper use weber rinne tests combined clinician knowledge patient complaints examination ear canal eardrum permit accurate classification
patients combined mixed conductive sensorineural loss fork tests help tell predominant
