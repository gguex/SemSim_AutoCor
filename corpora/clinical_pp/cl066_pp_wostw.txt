make cake
important feature many cases aphasia dysfunction minimal aphasia nothing condition
patient speaks listen carefully note fluency words per unit time
place patient one three groups fluent normal nonfluent
circumlocution use phrases eat instead fork write instead pen
empty words using generalized nonspecific terms refer specific objects thing place
patient never gets punchline words
paraphasia common important finding aphasia
phonemic literal paraphasia substitution addition deletion phonemes fish dish kenry hissinger henry kissinger
verbal semantic paraphasia use incorrect word cleaned fingernails ice pick
neologism applied speech source word unrecognizable
paraphasic speech commonly combines types
word finding difficulty frequent hesitation coming words especially nouns times using wrong word
delayed response questions delay difficulty answering questions
anxiety speech many patients aware problems become agitated confronted tasks involving language
perseveration using word
example asked name pencil patient say pencil succeeding object regardless
note especially handling small grammatical words numbers versus handling nouns
aphasic patients handle small words andor numbers much greater ease nouns
comprehension spoken language use questions answered yes feel well

follows fairly simple diagrammatic approach cortex handles higher functions
current knowledge quite incomplete
number different concepts concerning cortex handles language
concept outlined clinically useful taken bedside
outline based upon elegant discussions geschwind
approaches used covered references
cerebral cortex receives sensory impulses integrates produces motor response speech
great majority individuals largely function left dominant hemisphere
trace path visual stimulus time reading word monkey spoken word figure

normally course word perceived visual fields
monkey seen left visual field stimulus goes right visual calcarine cortex area brodmann
see chapters visual acuity visual fields description path taken
stimulus next transferred contiguous area cortex visual association cortex parietal areas brodmann occipital lobes
concept association areas quite important
current views cerebral organization follow flechsig rule see geschwind
gray matter cerebral cortex composed two types primary cortex association cortex
principal primary areas include vision hearing sensory motor cortex
areas connected part body served e g retina visual cortex surrounding cortex short u fibers
surrounding adjacent cortex termed association cortex table
association cortex connected association areas within hemisphere intrahemispheral fibers sibling association area opposite hemisphere transcallosal fibers
example calcarine cortex right side direct connections left calcarine cortex distant cortical areas

next station hearing association cortex wernicke area
primary cortex association cortex superior temporal gyrus near posterior end
collectively constitute areas brodmann
wernicke area thought storehouse auditory associations geschwind
words least nouns must processed wernicke area comprehended
apparently true spoken written words presumably related fact humans use spoken words learn written words
brain hear word monkey spoken internally comprehend word even word read
explains comprehension spoken written language lost lesions wernicke area
one way look functions three association areas described thus far visual angular supramarginal hearing conceive angular supramarginal gyri one side receiving visual image monkey side scanning wernicke area discover spoken word matches visual image
comprehension perhaps occurs two matched associated
note word monkey spoken instead read example would gone immediately primary hearing cortex thence wernicke area
presumably angular supramarginal gyri would activated told scan visual association cortex image matches word
stimulus monkey goes wernicke area portion motor association cortex known broca area
located posterior portion third frontal gyrus pars opercularis
broca area probably largely corresponds brodmann area although mohr points unique histological features
broca area association area primary motor cortex speech
question arises motor association cortex related primary motor cortex
primary motor cortex activates individual muscles participate action
apparently knowledge sequence muscle activation contained motor association cortex
put another way memory code muscles activate activate present motor association cortex
lesion association cortex result inability carry certain action walking waving goodbye making fist command even though strength present
called apraxia
loss memory motor performance
lesions broca area result loss memory speak words
comprehension intact since wernicke posterior areas intact
final cortical station monkey primary motor cortex direction broca area activates specific muscles necessary speak word

patients associated right hemiplegia due involvement primary motor cortex
repetition quite abnormal
auditory visual comprehension either intact largely since posterior speech areas affected
patients become frustrated angry hear speak since self monitoring intact due fact posterior speech areas spared
lesion involves broca area
buccofacial respiratory apraxia present command patient unable perform activities sticking tongue puckering lips whistling coughing sniffing like

fascinating aspect type aphasia many patients intact singing swearing serial speech counting months year etc
yamadori et al
mohr feel classic view broca aprasia presented corresponds clinical autopsy material
describes two different syndromes
first small lesions limited broca area produce spectrum features
mildest cases slight disturbance melody speech mechanisms speech suddenly altered way possibly apparent victim beholder
severely affected patients mute severe dyspraxia upper extremities oral buccal lingual respiratory function
agrammatism features broca aphasia described present although slight degree language disorder patient tested carefully
improvement mute patients rapid emergence dysarthric speech elements aphasia
lesions cases small discrete infarcts produced emboli lying origin anterior branches upper division left middle cerebral artery
second syndrome described mohr large lesions present sylvian region involving operculum including broca area insula adjacent cerebral cortex territory supplied upper division middle cerebral artery
patients different clinical picture one described broca area infarcts
initially mutism profound total aphasia contrast mutism faint evidence aphasia patients lesions limited broca area
time mutism aphasia evolve classic picture broca aphasia agrammatism telegraphic speech disturbances language communication described
picture present months years onset illness
mohr conclusions follows
cases embolic hemorrhagic stroke affecting anterior superior sylvian region including operculum insula subjacent white matter appear produce spectrum deficits predicted lesion site size
broca area appears one many regions along sylvian region integrate one another allow speaking
brain appears able overcome broca area infarction perhaps recruitment adjacent regions side transcallosal pathways minor hemisphere
mutism vocal apraxia central language disorder seem result broca area infarction
larger disorder referred broca aphasia appeals require much larger lesion involving upper operculum insula
spread deficit tasks speaking indicates fundamental disorder shared modalities speech production reception
linguistic features different wernicke aphasia seem distinctive
requirement lesion larger broca area suggests broca area may important language function
suggests language function mediated sylvian operculum insula might analogy orchestra synergistic product elementary individual speech functions accomplished along region resistant significant persisting functional loss enough elements lost cooperative results longer recognizable
conduction aphasia central aphasia kurt goldstein three features characteristically present benson et al fluent speechthough fluent wernicke aphasiawith notable paraphasia
paraphasia commonly literal fish dish
patients often become quite frustrated hear speak indicating posterior speech areas functioning monitors
normal comprehension
grossly defective repetition
three conditions must met make diagnosis
additional common necessary features include l anomia variable degree inability read aloud due repetition disturbances although silent reading normal terms comprehension dysgraphia varying mild misspellings complete agraphia buccofacial bilateral upper limb apraxia face mild absent motor deficits neurologic abnormalities including mild right hemiparesis hemisensory deficit
common lesion lies deep supramarginal gyrus left anterior inferior parietal area
lesion interrupts arcuate fasciculus connecting wernicke broca areas
less common location lesion destroys first temporal gyrus left obliterating left auditory cortex
apraxia associated former lesion latter
wernicke aphasia receptive aphasia sensory aphasia fluent aphasia posterior aphasia consists outpouring words absent comprehension repetition
broca area running without control posterior speech area wernicke
since wernicke area required comprehension spoken written words understandable comprehensionwritten spokenand repetition defective

since wernicke area connected broca area repetition intact
characteristics case reported quadfasel segarra geschwind
absent spontaneous speech lack comprehension
intact repetition addition completion certain phrases
example roses red
said would say roses red violets blue sugar sweet
could learn new songs sing
would repeat sentences said parrotlike fashion echolalia
penmanship intact since broca area intact writing absent
example patient could copy express ideas
comprehension absent connections cortical areas lacking
written material could connected wernicke area verbal expression therefore comprehension
similarly spoken information access visual association area images could aroused speech
disturbance produced lesion frontal lobe anterior superior broca area
speech nonfluent comprehension relatively preserved producing similarity broca aphasia
however repetition remarkably preserved patient easily repeat long sentences phonetically syntactically complex
upper extremity weakness may pronounced proximally distally watershed distribution rubens
large lesions watershed distribution parietooccipitotemporal areas destroy connection areas wernicke area remains connected broca area
comprehension defective one would expect
patient effortlessly repeat long complex sentences
fluent empty speech strikingly devoid substantive words nouns action verbs
repetition intact
comprehension varies intact impaired
patients left angular gyrus lesion also seen lesions locationseven frontal lobe
patients understand spoken word though hearing intact
comprehend written word normally read aloud without problems
disorder seen bilateral temporal lobe lesions single deep left sided temporal lesion separates wernicke area primary auditory cortex
many cases arise recovery phase wernicke aphasia
patients comprehend spoken word normally read
