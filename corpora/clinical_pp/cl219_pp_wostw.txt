proper evaluation use anthropometric measures height weight head circumference must accorded equal status clinical data
greatest difficulty lies definition normality
generally done statistically
unfortunately often leads common error assuming average median value represents optimum given patient
erroneous clear one imagines normal children age different weight
child median th percentile child heavier half others lighter would considered normal even though violates original premise children normal
necessary concept wide range normal allows another kind error accepting normal individual value falls within normal range fact abnormal given child
compounded fact eye figures paper abnormality may apparent even practiced eye skilled physician
reason absolutely necessary plot parameters growth suitable graphic chart
plotting data brings light even slight departures expected path
small changes failure gain kilogram months apparent
serial data thus plotted constitute best standard normality individual
well established individual grows channel probably genetically determined channel specific individual
departures channel rare exceptions occur event noxious influence e g disease calorie excess deficit even psychic disorder
departures occur return original channel observed cause repaired
case growth failure example return occurs catch growth represents fastest growth rate known
dealing sick child absence earlier serial data turning corner catch growth channel parallels designated percentile guide good often means identifying channel normal child opportunity accumulate sufficient serial data
charts common use based measurements populations presumed normal children
one familiarity base data
chart based children living boston derived population iowa farm children
group charts set recent standard derived nih studies covering wider spectrum united states
wetzel grid although never popular little used unique property developed theoretic grounds instead statistical description population
grid plots developmental level parameter related physique surface area basal metabolic rate age
shown valid population species
another type chart tanner developed depicts rate growth versus unit time
particularly useful studying changing rates growth characteristic various periods life relating events puberty adolescence physical growth
referred later
happens one adheres standard normality consisting following channel maintaining percentile rank charts alluded serve purpose although percentile ranking may vary chart used
charts designed increments measure plotted time thus represent achieved status given age
humans grow different rates different times life rate differences sexes various tissues different rates growth time
obvious examples fact girls often even greater height male peers surpassed stature males within couple years
lymphoid structures child grow rapidly within years achieve status far exceeding adult size fact receding adolescence body whole skeletal muscle mass blood volume increasing rate growth
thus second grader tonsils may large yet enlarged young child spleen may become palpable infection mesenteric adenopathy ever present differential diagnosis appendicitis children
human head grows fast reaches near adult size years
rapid head growth necessitates birth humans unlike mammalian species time long walking possible
head could pass pelvic outlet
special charts used follow phenomenon
skull readily expansible increasing intracranial pressure may manifest signs papilledema example may occur sutures knit
human growth curves characteristic species
conception lag phase soon becomes logarithmic
term birth occurs logarithmic phase birth child growing rate kgyr
growth rate declines almost asymptotically end first year growth proceeding much slower pace
kgyr
marked reduction rate regarded physiologic marker end infancy
notable major inflections growth curve also associated signal developmental events example accomplishment locomotion psychodynamic companion first autonomy struggle
nutritional requirements high periods rapid growth hence deficiency states likely wake
characteristically clinical scurvy rickets iron deficiency anemia arise latter half first year
similarly next inflection adolescent growth spurt find increased vulnerability depletion calcium iron stores another autonomy struggle time involving separation home parents whereas first one terrible twos represented chiefly separation mother
awareness growth phases attendant psychodynamic implications enables examiner anticipate patient behavior facilitates establishment effective rapport well suggesting normal pathologic phenomena searched
useful conceive developmental periods characterized certain tasks accomplished
failure accomplish developmental tasks evidence disease either past present
birth infant largely reflex equipped primitive reflexes
rooting sucking reflexes obviously utilitarian
generally true developmental milestones first present reflex form modified developing central nervous system achieves peripheral connection myelinization long spinal tracts
example newborn infant firm reflex grasp
requires months child able reach seize object done gross fashion using chiefly ulnar musculature
require another months able release object held grasp hence ability move object one hand marks middle first year
months thumb finger apposition come play child becomes prehensile
development follows principle cephalo caudal differentiation easily observed child struggles seize objects hand made brain wishes
social interplay cortical function well developed months child begin move objects hand hand shoulder girdle cervical spine yet usefully move lower extremities lumbar plexus associated myotomes
early speech sounds appear ambulation well established
evaluation young sick infant quite difficult signs indicating disease manifest
social smile earliest sign interpersonal interaction appears weeks
lack even rudimentary sign aid overall estimate severity illness commonly dictates infants lesser age observed hospital conditions becomes clear serious disease present
acquiring command one body major task first year
soon end first year ambulation well established
newfound ability leave mother ushers period known parents terrible twos
developmental task period discover establish self identity
reason child finds difficult accede adult requests
essential established autonomous individual
therefore child agreeable always bidding others fact autonomous existence would firmly established
usually futile examiner try coax child age cooperation
firm gentle mastery effective humane emerging personality required lose face yielding
child established independent existence usually age years become friendly amiable patient readily cooperate reasonable nonthreatening requests
exploration environment interpersonal difficulties encountered adults operate make accident trauma child abuse major health problems age group
immunologic adaptations also changing
young infant certain passively acquired defenses infectious disease lost toward end first year
effective replacement artificial immunity supervision natural acquisition disease resistance major medical tasks
newborn infant lived recently acquired gut flora enteric organisms important hazard
child inability respond certain antigens results vulnerability encapsulated bacteria respiratory tract first years creating spectrum disease unique time life
acquiring skills independent function within family task next years
things toilet training self dressing eating behavior learned difficulties encountered process common problems life
success phase preparation next years task develop capacity skills necessary function society
years society takes leading role formalized training programs established young
although child relatively free acute disease years slippage due mental slowness learning disability chronic disease socioeconomic status begins manifest wreak secondary tolls
adolescence ushered undeniable physiologic anatomic changes puberty characterized accelerating growth rates mesenchymal reproductive tissues
changes occur females years earlier males
growth spurt contains within endocrine feedback mechanisms seeds termination
wide range normal developmental schedules requires great precision descriptive terminology
describe genitalia infantile might acceptable earlier age entirely useless period one normal year old may infantile another well developed
tanner described staging development correlates events sexual development growth rate curve makes possible quick accurate recording individual status
use tanner staging standard purpose
first task adolescence acceptance new body gender role accompanies
many difficult task one must approached gradually
unisex clothing strategies useful delaying decisions required development seen
girls ladies one day tomboys next
quiet boy difficulty taking macho ways distressed
normal differences breast genital size even though temporary cause problems
second task separation home family establishing oneself independent adult society
important separating mother age equally unpleasant
difficult parents understand parents disqualified counselors children must least symbolically revolution child declares independence accomplished relationship however close must adult adult parent child
necessary separation come easy child must seek secure base outside home hence importance peer groups following styles fads means allying resources outside home
essence must differ parent generation
parents efforts join adolescent children pursuits ill conceived attempts buddies counterproductive
unfortunately failure part parents understand normal development often leads younger generation adopt extreme tactics drug abuse running away pregnancy establish point must made
females menarche best clinical sign patient entered last phase declining rate growth
males enter phase years later event lacks clear clinical marker case
cessation growth marks logical end pediatrics current convention usually taken around age
practical reasons pediatricians use high school graduation convenient marker extending case patients suffering marked developmental delay
practice course brings pediatrician problems gynecology contraception occasional example non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus mature onset diabetes young problems characteristic adult practice
continual change essence life
cessation growth end adolescence end development
development physical prowess skill mental processes continues many years
even middle age interrupt development
inevitably process involution begins
like growth earlier years affects different tissues structures different rates slowed first replacement declining functions newfound skills bionic parts
ultimately however change ceaseslife ceases
two patients diagnosis disease
problem formulations different appropriate managements
