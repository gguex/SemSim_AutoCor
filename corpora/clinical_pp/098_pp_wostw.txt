tests fecal occult blood detect blood stool visible gross inspection usually less mg hemoglobin per gram stool
normal adults usually show less mggm
increased amounts associated variety benign malignant gastrointestinal diseases especially colonic neoplasms tests often used screening patients lesions
benzidine based tests e g hematest virtually eliminated use excessive sensitivity results high frequency false positive reactions well carcinogenicity reagent
current worldwide standard hemoccult slide test smith kline diagnostics guaiac based test one side guaiac impregnated paper smeared stool tested addition drops developer solution stabilized peroxide reagent opposite side paper

however rehydration specimens also increases rate false positive reactions plant peroxidases meat hemes diet recommended unless rigid adherence restricted diet outlined table
modification hemoccult test marketed coloscreen helena laboratories selective inhibitor nonheme vegetable peroxidases added hopes diminishing false positive reactions source
another group tests based immunologic detection human hemoglobin globin stool tests developed thus far unreliable undersensitivity poor reproducibility
approaches might improve specificity neither solves problem major variable degradation hematin globin intestinal lumen problem shared hemoccult
new promising almost quantitative approach hemoquant bioscience labs measure fecal hemes specific fluorescence porphyrin derivatives extraction porphyrins specimen remove interfering substances
variable proportion unabsorbed hemoglobinhematin converted porphyrins intestinal bacteria called intestinally converted fraction icf fraction extracted organic solvent presence citric acid
remaining intact hemes chemically converted porphyrins heating test tube presence oxalic acid ferrous sulfate extracted along icf yield total converted porphyrins measure total unabsorbed hemes
hemoquant little affected variable degradation hemes intestinal lumen degree hydration stool insensitive nonheme peroxidases oral iron cimetidine almost quantitative
therefore highly likely become future test choice simplified cost reduced
early hope icf would help distinguish upper lower gastrointestinal blood loss realized
neither hemoquant variants new tests numerous commercial imitations hemoccult undergone extensive evaluation large screening programs documented efficacy identified limitations interpretation hemoccult test
moreover appropriate upper normal limits fecal hemes established new tests
present therefore hemoccult validated test appropriate use detection fecal occult blood
shown figure erythrocytes entering gastrointestinal lumen usually lysed free hemoglobin converted free hematin fe state plus globin
hematin absorbed converted bilirubin microsomal heme oxygenase enterocytes
remaining may degraded principally colonic bacteria form porphyrins
globin digested pancreatic intestinal mucosal proteases yield peptides amino acids
many tests designed detect hemoglobin intestinal metabolites stool figure
thus blood released gastrointestinal tract detected hemoglobin cr labeled red cells immunoassay hematin peroxidase activity porphyrins fluorescence globin immunoassay
tests inherent unreliability however proportion hemoglobin degraded varies greatly among individuals
truly quantitative tests radioassay cr stool intravenous administration autologous red cells labeled cr chromate b chain hemoglobin chromate neither degraded absorbed intestine measurement total fecal porphyrins chemical conversion fecal hemoglobin porphyrins hemoquant test
unfortunately two tests complex cumbersome time consuming expensive
consequently widely used established methods rely detection undegraded hematin hemoglobin virtue peroxidase like activity
peroxidase based tests figure
involve addition stool sample peroxide substrate guaiac benzidine related compounds redox indicator
peroxidase activity hematin andor hemoglobin catalyzes oxidation colorless indicator compound blue quinone
false positive reactions given materials catalyze peroxidase reaction table including dietary peroxidases vegetable fruits hemoglobin myoglobin red meats especially rare raw oral iron thought problem shown clearly affect hemoccult test
cimetidine also gives false positive reactions aspirates gastric arid duodenal juice drug absorbed reaching colon
false negative tests occur high concentrations reducing agents present diet especially ascorbic acid citrus fruits juices doses mg daily
drugs aspirin nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents often cause erosions bleeding otherwise normal gastric mucosa also lead positive tests may falsely suggest presence intrinsic lesion
therefore important intake interfering substances eliminated days days collection stools tested
colonic neoplasms gastrointestinal lesions bleed intermittently variable amounts day day
therefore six windows per stool Ã— stools yields blue reaction patient undergo intensive diagnostic study determine source blood loss
western nations hemoccult screening truly asymptomatic populations aged years yielded positive tests unrestricted diet less positive tests restricted diet table
latter diet positive tests found carcinoma benign neoplasms e g polyps usually colon
another positive subjects reveal gastrointestinal lesions might responsible occult bleeding e g hemorrhoids diverticulosis inflammatory bowel disease peptic ulcer gastritis esophagitis esophageal varices
less usually less positive subjects reveal lesions probably false positive tests due vegetable peroxidases diet
sixty five colorectal carcinomas benign colonic adenomas detected three stool hemoccult test
thus one positive stool indication full work entire colon including either air contrast barium enema plus flexible cm sigmoidoscopy full colonoscopy
flexible sigmoidoscopy rigid proctoscopy alone satisfactory complementary tests hemoccult screening programs inadequate evaluation hemoccult positive stool one third colonic neoplasms proximal rectosigmoid
benign lesions lesions discovered full examination colon upper gastrointestinal endoscopy probably indicated though cost effectiveness validated
still nothing found probably best evaluate hemoccult test false positive using cr labeled erythrocytes hemoquant test quantify fecal blood loss
presence bleeding confirmed one may consider performance small bowel series mesenteric angiography andor abdominal scintiscan intravenous administration mtc labeled erythrocytes
unfortunately tests low yield patient occult blood loss
fluorescein string test upper gastrointestinal blood loss high frequency false positive results used
colorectal neoplasms detected hemoccult screening either benign adenomas duke stage b carcinomas year survival resection
contrast patients symptomatic carcinoma proportion year survivals less
built biases screening programs however one may merely making diagnosis earlier stage disease without actually postponing time demise
therefore yet proven screening colon cancer actually improves survival long term randomized prospective studies well way new york minneapolis answer important question
