diabetes mellitus name given heterogeneous group disorders common abnormal glucose tolerance
classification given table
based etiologic differences disorders rather formerly used phenomenologic classification
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus iddm type diabetes formerly called juvenile onset diabetes characterized absolute dependency exogenous insulin
people diabetes type
non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm type ii diabetes formerly referred adult onset maturity onset characterized gradual onset hyperglycemia tendency ketoacidosis except extraordinary stress
people niddm may take insulin control hyperglycemia absolutely required
people niddm obese type sometimes subdivided obese nonobese categories
eighty five people diabetes type
maturity onset diabetes young mody differs niddm clearly defined autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
hyperglycemia type generally quite mild
mody also characterized decreased frequency long term complications diabetes
diabetes due abnormalities amino acid sequence insulin abnormalities cleavage proinsulin causing decreased insulin action referred insulinopathies manner analogous hemoglobinopathies
prevalence abnormalities established
least three types diabetes found association dermatologic disorder acanthosis nigricans
three types associated severe resistance action insulin due abnormal insulin receptor type antibodies insulin receptor type b post receptor abnormalities type c
number congenital syndromes associated abnormal glucose tolerance mechanisms responsible disordered carbohydrate metabolism mostly unknown
diabetes may secondary result direct ablation beta cells association pancreatitis pancreatectomy hemochromatosis
separate category designated gestational diabetes refers women whose diabetes first becomes manifest pregnancy
although diabetes normally resolves upon delivery following years women subsequently relapse overt niddm
criteria varying degrees impairment glucose tolerance given table
criteria used diagnosis diabetes mellitus type diabetes
three types acute complications generally occur severe hyperglycemia associated hyperosmolar non ketotic state severe hperglycemia associated ketoacidosis hypoglycemia
chronic complications generally classified vascular nonvascular
macrovascular complications caused large vessel disease complications relate vascular system involved e g cerebrovascular coronary artery peripheral vascular disease
microvascular complications caused small vessel disease include retinopathy renal glomerular disease kimmelstiel wilson disease neuropathies mononeuropathies possibly cardiac small vessels
non vascular complications include cataracts polyneuropathy peripheral autonomic
history conceptually divided several sections classification type diabetes delineation complications diabetes assessment usual control especially recent control diabetes mode therapy including diet exercise oral hypoglycemic agents insulin medications conditions impact control diabetes
type diabetes usually easy classify
ketoacidosis onset moderate stress usually indicates iddm
insulin use per se differentiate iddm niddm patients latter may using insulin control hyperglycemia
one hand lack requirement insulin effectively excludes iddm
many patients especially onset disease may difficult classify never ketoacidosis
patients mody strong family history diabetes display autosomal dominant mode
insulin receptor disorders characterized acanthosis nigricans may detected examination
patients secondary diabetes history pancreatitis andor pancreatectomy usually obtainable
patients hemochromatosis usually display characteristic hepatomegaly bronzing skin often hypogonadal
frequency episodes severe hyperglycemia may clue underlying medical conditions recurrent urinary tract infections psychologic disorders
patients said brittle usually underlying reasons brittleness
frequent hypoglycemic reactions usually result erratic timing meals andor exercise match timing insulin injections
critical parts history detecting presence hypoglycemia reactions night sleep presence nightmares excessive perspiration waking morning headache
often urine show morning ketones nocturnal hypoglycemic episode
patients long standing iddm lose many warning symptoms characteristic hypoglycemia e g tremor perspiration anxiety
patients may go feeling normal unconsciousness within minutes
therefore necessary ask typical symptoms patients hypoglycemia reaction
hypoglycemia rarely occurs patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents may prolonged may require inpatient treatment
rarely fasting hypoglycemia may indicate development insulinoma patients diabetes increased risk
patients may may aware chronic complications
slow gradual decrease vision may indicate presence cataract especially older patients
recent blurring vision may simply indicate lens swelling poor control
sudden loss vision concern indicates need rapid ophthalmologic consultation
sudden loss vision may result hemorrhage retinal detachment vascular disease
sudden onset diplopia ptosis may indicative cranial nerve infarct causes need exclusion
bell palsy also frequent diabetes
loss strength speech neurologic symptoms may secondary cerebrovascular disease usually thrombotic type
patients occlusive coronary artery disease commonly pain myocardial infarction
therefore sudden onset dyspnea peripheral edema symptoms congestive heart failure may indicative recent infarction
nephropathy often silent advanced stages patients may present edema nephrotic syndrome
hypertension may reflect developing nephropathy
historical review however may elicit previous history previous physicians noticed proteinuria
uncommonly renal failure may present increase hypoglycemic reactions caused loss kidney component insulin degradation
early peripheral neuropathy frequently asymptomatic
later stages patients may complain numbness burning pains feet
neuropathic findings may also present hands patients frequently complain dropping things
neuropathy progresses symptoms ascend stocking glove fashion
carpal tunnel syndrome frequent patients diabetes characteristic symptoms may confused diabetic neuropathy
muscle weakness atrophy may present diabetic neuropathic amyotrophy especially hands
peripheral neuropathy may cause development foot ulcers patient feel discomfort poorly fitting shoes pebble
questioning evidence redness skin breakdown may serve prevent future problems
various types autonomic neuropathy particularly bothersome
cardiac plus peripheral vascular autonomic neuropathy may cause orthostatic hypotension lightheadedness
gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy may cause delayed gastric emptying patients may develop early satiety vomiting undigested food
patients may also get hyperglycemic mismatching insulin action timing nutrient absorption intestine
intestinal autonomic neuropathy may also cause erratic peristalsis nocturnal diarrhea common complaint
rarely patients may develop bacterial overgrowth steatorrhea symptoms foul smelling floating greasy stools
genitourinary neuropathy common cause impotence diabetic men although vascular disease may also cause
neuropathic vascular impotence characterized absence nocturnal morning erections intact libido
several varieties bladder neuropathy early sign may recurrent urinary tract infections secondary failure complete bladder emptying
symptoms new onset poor control diabetes include polyuria polydipsia polyphagia weight loss fatigue vaginal candida infections
patients previously diagnosed disease monitor diabetes either self monitoring blood glucose levels urine glucose testing
tests may assessed degree control
evidence recent decrease glycemic control may clue underlying infection inflammatory disorder
various modes therapy used patients important
assessment adherence diet compliance insulin regimen may reveal control worsened hypoglycemic reactions occur
remember rather large interindividual variation insulin time action regard
pattern insulin site rotation may important exercise shortly injection insulin exercising limb shown affect insulin absorption dramatically
patients taking older oral hypoglycemic agents symptoms flushing dizziness may indicate antabuse like reaction alcohol
drugs may also uncommonly cause cholestatic jaundice
chlorpropamide use may occasionally result syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone siadh secretion patients may present altered consciousness
medications may also affect diabetes
propranolol nonselective beta blockers may cause worsening glucose tolerance also decrease ability recover hypoglycemia
furthermore drugs may block adrenergic warning symptoms hypoglycemia e g palpitations tremor resulting profound hypoglycemia loss consciousness
thiazide diuretics estrogens phenytoin may worsen glucose tolerance well
current classification given diabetes based etiology
based proper classification patients future epidemiologic studies may afford better insights pathogenesis prognosis types diabetes complications
autoimmune etiology iddm well established quite different etiology niddm
although etiology niddm well understood clear disorder characterized resistance action insulin inability islets secrete enough insulin overcome insulin resistance overproduction glucose liver
long term complications diabetes likely caused abnormal metabolic milieu
although studies suggest long term complications may ameliorated cases intensive management aim restoring normoglycemia proven
whether long term complications prevented remains seen
also clear intensive management results significantly greater frequency hypoglycemic reactions
links postulated occur complications diabetes abnormal metabolism include accumulation polyols tissues glycosylation structural proteins lowering high density lipoproteins hdl elevation low density lipoproteins ldl
