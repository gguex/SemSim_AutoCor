humans animals exposed intermittent high potassium intake could increase extracellular potassium abruptly resulting major change ki ke ratio potentially disastrous consequences
prevent potassium initially shifted cell added large intracellular pool without changing ratio significantly kidney able excrete dietary load
following factors important internal regulation potassium
factors shift potassium cell
insulin catecholamines aldosterone alkalemia
factors shift potassium cell
increase osmolality acidemia
insulin secretion stimulated increase serum potassium shifts potassium liver muscle cells
catecholamines stimulation beta receptors also able shift potassium cell
aldosterone stimulated rise serum potassium minimal effect potassium distribution intracellular extracellular compartments
insulin catecholamines important normal regulation potassium given exogenously physiologic pharmacologic doses change potassium distribution significantly
acid base balance plasma osmolality usual physiologic regulators potent influence potassium distribution
acid base balance affects serum potassium exchange hydrogen ions potassium across cell membrane

reverse occurs acidemia shift potassium cell
sudden increase plasma osmolality shift water cell drag potassium water
result significant rise serum potassium

table
indicates hypokalemia associated low total body potassium either due poor dietary intake increased potassium loss body
poor intake uncommon cause foods contain potassium
nevertheless patients extremely poor dietary intake commonly alcoholics patients severe weight reduction programs danger developing severe potassium deficiency
hypokalemia due increase potassium loss commonly secondary gastrointestinal disorders
although potassium content gastrointestinal fluids quite low table resultant dehydration stimulates aldosterone production increases urinary potassium significantly
renal potassium wasting continues long dehydration persists
gastrointestinal fluid loss stomach hypokalemia partly due intracellular shift potassium secondary alkalemia partly due increased renal potassium loss due high aldosterone level
sweat contains small amount potassium excess sweating rarely cause significant hypokalemia
renal potassium loss commonly associated high aldosterone level either primary secondary event
common cause renal potassium wastage use diuretics induce kaliuresis several mechanisms including increase aldosterone level increase urine volume increase delivery sodium exchange sites hypochloremia metabolic alkalosis
