liver largest organ human body
development liver size increases increasing age averaging cm span years attaining adult size age
size depends several factors age sex body size shape well particular examination technique utilized e g palpation versus percussion versus radiographic
percussion mean liver size cm women
cm men table
liver span cm larger smaller values considered abnormal
liver weighs g adult woman g adult man
normal liver concealed right rib cage beyond feel examiner hand figures
normal liver smooth irregularities
liver felt usually due increased diaphragmatic descent presence palpable caudate riedel lobe presence emphysema associated depressed diaphragm thin body habitus narrow thoracic cage fatty infiltration enlarged rounded edge active hepatitis enlarged tender cirrhosis enlarged nodular irregularity hepatic neoplasm enlarged rock hard nodular consistency
examination performed patient recumbent position right handed examiner right side patient
every effort made patient relaxed avoid tensing abdominal musculature
flexing knees placing pillow beneath knees may facilitate relaxation abdominal wall
initial observation abdomen important enlarged liver may visible inferior margin protuberant abdomen harboring ascites may first clue hepatic cirrhosis malignancy
stigmata liver disease e g vascular spiders caput medusa may observed
patient right upper quadrant observed appearance fullness rest deep inspiration
auscultation liver follows inspection
percussion performed determine liver size margins liver estimated technique
upper border percussed using heavy percussion eliminating resonant quality produced overlying segment lung
light percussion examiner ear close abdomen best determines lower border liver liver apposition anterior abdominal wall
inferior extent may underestimated heavy percussion used
percussion first performed right midclavicular line midsternal anterior axillary lines
normal upper level liver level right nipple whereas lower margin liver right costal margin
normal size variable particularly relation body size
palpation performed determine liver shape consistency
single handed palpation used lean individuals bimanual technique best obese muscular individuals deep palpation
using either technique liver felt best deep inspiration
single handed palpation examiner right hand initially placed level percussed dullness inferior liver margin midclavicular line parallel rectus muscle
done palpation rectus confused palpation underlying adjacent liver
bimanual palpation figure left hand held posteriorly twelfth rib iliac crest lateral paraspinous muscles
lifted gently upward elevate bulk liver easily accessible position right hand held anterior lateral rectus musculature
right hand moves upward using gentle steady pressure liver edge felt
normal liver may slightly tender upon palpation inflamed liver hepatitis often exquisitely tender
patient reassured discomfort momentary
nodularity irregularity firmness hardness liver characterized
repeated studies shown percussion liver superior palpatory measurement liver span right costal margin estimation hepatic enlargement
although palpation percussion commonly used clinical methods determining liver size radiologic methods recently become popular
technetium liver scans favored past often underestimated liver size particularly metastatic disease
ultrasound fairly accurate computed tomography reliable method determining vertical liver span overall dimensions
advent liver transplantation become clear great need exact determination liver size
calculated volume measurements made ultrasound computed tomography provide best estimates
computed tomography serial transverse slices obtained enclosed area calculated computer total organ volume estimated
technique provides calculated liver volumes within actual volume determined autopsy
recent report using sagittal sections liver obtained ultrasound found superior transverse sections obtained computed tomography lack respiratory artifact sagittal sections obtained
refinements scanning techniques may increase accuracy
majority normal examinations liver palpable
cases normal liver palpable include emphysema right sided pleural effusion thin body carriage riedel lobe deep diaphragmatic excursion
emphysema lungs hyperexpanded diaphragmatic flattening thereby lowering upper lower borders liver
large right pleural effusion effect lowering liver boundaries
accurate percussion upper liver border patient right pleural effusion difficult fluid density overlying liver dullness
persons deep diaphragmatic excursion singers endurance athletes may palpable liver inspiration
common diseases table
associated palpable enlarged liver include metastatic cancer lymphoma congestive heart failure alcoholic hepatitis causes fatty liver e g jejunoileal bypass total parenteral nutrition
cirrhosis may associated liver small normal enlarged size
metastatic primary liver cancer liver becomes infiltrated deposits cancer cells grow rapidly
neoplastic growth usually distinguished normal liver palpation hard andor nodular tissue consistency
similar liver enlargement occur lymphoma
cirrhosis liver may enlarged small latter usually occurring end stage cirrhosis fulminant hepatic failure following hepatocyte necrosis collapse
consistency usually nodular cirrhosis
classically micronodular due alcoholic nutritional disease macronodular cirrhosis posthepatitic
alcoholic hepatitis causes fatty liver lead liver enlargement hepatocyte fatty infiltration hepatocyte enlargement
hepatic distention smooth enlargement typical significant right sided heart failure occurs hepatic venous congestion secondary impaired myocardial function
