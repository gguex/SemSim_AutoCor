patient history determines scope intensity chest examination
history elicits suspicion presence chest problem physical examination thorax must expanded beyond minimal screening examination determine nature problem diagnosis made
setting chest examination must environmentally comfortable clinician patient
physical examination begins commencement history taking
examiner extends hand greeting asks symptoms initiated visit begins physical inspection noting body position assessing degree comfort inspecting palpating hands noting grip strength
history determines examination format
experienced clinicians exploit history help look specific physical findings answer questions posed totality data collected previously
using process unusual two consecutive chest examinations identical
time physical examination complete even laboratory evaluations initiated diagnosis reasonably certain
pulmonary examination consists inspection palpation percussion auscultation
inspection process initiates continues throughout patient encounter
palpation confirmed percussion assesses tenderness degree chest expansion
auscultation sensitive process confirms earlier findings may help identify specific pathologic processes previously recognized

dress may give clue occupation hobby grooming may related conscientiousness patient may follow health care plan bulging shirt pocket may stuffed open package cigarettes important clue possibility chest problem
inspection continues even though patient remains fully clothed formal physical examination yet begun
often helpful make initial assessment ventilatory pattern early data collection process
specifically one concerned rate rhythm breath volume apparent effort associated breathing
resting adults breathe times per minute customary often noted medical records
tidal volumes range around ml
except occasional sigh normal ventilatory pattern regular effortless
disease pattern may change
assessment ventilatory pattern history give patient opportunity alter breathing involuntarily confound data
also allows one process data earlier increase efficiency
formal physical examination begin setting changed
inspection continues patient undressed waist either entirely sequentially drapes changed expose areas actively observed
chaperon present would make either patient examiner comfortable
first one observe thoracic cage deformity pectus excavatum pectus carinatum scoliosis kyphosis surgical traumatic scars thoracoplasty gynecomastia called barrel chest deformity
presence skin lesions may reflect intrathoracic pathology
static observations
even useful information obtained patient breathes quietly deeply
dynamic observations include search supraclavicular intercostal retraction paradoxical movement abdomen degree asymmetry asynchrony chest expansion muscle wasting hypertrophy reproducible grimaces discomfort given point ventilatory cycle

palpation table
next stage examination
patient disrobed place entire palm hand first superior portion hemithoraces gently though firmly move hand inferiorly twelfth rib
repeat process moving laterally subsequently anteriorly search rib deformities nodules areas tenderness
face history chest discomfort ask patient point areas greatest discomfort
palpate area increasing firmness attempt elicit tenderness assess maneuver reproduces patient symptoms
pay particular attention costochondral junctions patients reporting anterior chest pain evaluate possibility costochondritis
palpation also important assessment ventilation
one sensitively assess symmetry synchrony volume breath
done examining patient posteriorly placing examiner thumbs together midline level tenth rib hands grasping lateral rib cage visual tactile observations made tidal volume breathing deep forceful inhalation
latter thumbs typically separate approximately cm
part palpatory portion chest examination assess position trachea

discussed auscultation
purpose percussion table
determine area percussed finger air filled sounding resonant like drum fluid filled dull sound solid flat sound
make interpretation important listen sound produced also feel intensity frequency vibrations produced maneuver
technique percussion best accomplished following approach
press distal phalanx middle finger firmly area percussed raise second fourth fingers chest surface otherwise sound tactile vibrations blunted
use quick sharp wrist motion like catcher throwing baseball second base strike finger contact chest wall tip third finger hand
best percussion site proximal distal interphalangeal joints
novice quickly learns trim fingernail prevent personal discomfort minor abrasions lacerations
sound vibrations produced seem suboptimal make sure finger placed directly thorax making firm direct contact chest wall
vibrations little sound produced
percuss posterior lateral anterior chest wall manner long axis percussed finger roughly parallel ribs
compare one side
area begin percussion superiorly extend inferiorly identify level diaphragm quiet tidal volume breathing
note position diaphragm
ask patient inhale fully hold continue percuss inferiorly determine new level diaphragm forced maximal inspiration
dont forget tell patient breathe normally
difference two levels known diaphragmatic excursion equal cm
auscultation chest table
part every chest examination data collected inspection palpation percussion alert clinician listen auscultation order identify correct diagnosis effectively
stethoscope instrument significantly amplify sound important acts selective filter sound
briefly bell filters high frequency sounds greater cycles per second therefore used detect low frequency sounds
hand diaphragm selectively filters low frequency sounds
since sounds produced breathing tend relatively high pitch chest ausculted diaphragm
auscultation chest ideally performed quiet room patient either sitting standing
posterior thorax examined patient arms crossed anteriorly move scapulas laterally much possible
comparing one side helpful maneuver identify patient normal
auscultation performed tidal ventilation deep forceful inspiration forceful expiration
intuitively obvious rigorously proved intensity breath sounds related flow rates louder sound greater flow rate things equal
primary structure chest designed facilitate ventilation accomplished increasing intrathoracic volume
increase due elevation ribs contraction scalene intercostal muscles descent diaphragm
structure ribs scalenus muscles elevate first rib sternum anteriorly
causes slight increase anteroposterior p diameter chest
lower ribs expand laterally contraction intercostal muscles
diaphragm contracting elevates lower ribs superiorly laterally well increases intrathoracic volume
deviation normal anatomical relationship skeletal system associated muscles would expected cause abnormality inspiratory cycle ventilation
ventilation movement gas produces sound audible stethoscope
generally velocity gas movement proportional intensity sound
qualitatively three types normal breath sounds vesicular bronchovesicular bronchial
three sounds clearly differentiated characteristics duration pitch intensity see table
vesicular sounds thought produced gas movement distalmost portions lung units
low pitch predominantly inspiratory timing breezy character
bronchial tracheal sounds produced high upper airways trachea
often loud high pitched
expiratory phase longer inspiration follows silent gap
bronchovesicular sounds intermediate two
normal circumstances air filled lung units act high frequency filters bronchial breath sounds generated upper airways poorly transmitted air filled lung
hand little air filled lung airways stethoscope lung units filled liquid rather gas bronchial breath sounds heard clearly
result bronchial breath sounds heard normally trachea upper sternum paraspinal areas upper thoracic vertebrae
one moves peripherally air filled lung found airways stethoscope breath sounds first become bronchovesicular quality eventually vesicular
stated intensity sound function airflow
careful examination upper lung fields reveals greater intensity breath sounds early inspiratory phase compared sounds generated inspiration lower lung fields intensity peaks rather late
reflection normal physiologic phenomenon one inhales residual volume initial bolus gas enters upper lobe alveoli lung units nearly filled bulk movement gas lower lung fields
obstruction airways upper lobes pattern longer present
three types abnormal breath sounds
frequently collectively referred adventitious breath sounds
easily recognized abnormal breath sound wheeze continuous musical sound produced critical velocity gas flow passes slitlike opening
pitch sound function compliance material producing slitlike opening original size obstructed tube
one may appreciate wheezing entire thorax locally
two abnormal breath sounds noncontinuous nature
crackle often called rale sounds like rubbing lock hair ear
vivo sound produced snapping open previously collapsed lung structures either airways alveoli
timing crackles invariably occur inspiration noted
done asking patient exhale fully noting timing crackles subsequent full inspiratory maneuver
crackles heard initiation inspiration called early inspiratory crackles
occur toward terminal portion inspiratory maneuver referred late inspiratory crackles
times crackling sounds heard throughout inspiratory phase called paninspiratory crackles
final abnormal breath sound called gurgle
similar sound produced one exhales straw placed glass water
gurgles produced airflow liquid varying viscosities airways
since clinicians use term rhonchus mean low pitched wheeze others use term mean gurgle recommended confusion minimized using term rhonchus
physical findings must interpreted light previously collected data
general scheme develop postulate test history additional observations maneuvers physical examinations laboratory tests
example year old pipefitter known exposure airborne asbestos material never smoked cigarettes presents increasing dyspnea cough would likely asbestosis interstitial fibrosis caused asbestos inhalation one observed dry nonproductive cough following every moderate deep breath initial data differed cigarettes pocket intermittent cough associated expectoration blood carcinoma lung might head differential diagnosis list
respiratory rate may increase presence interstitial pulmonary process chest wall restriction tidal volume typically remains unchanged
presence slow gasping ventilatory maneuvers ominous sign suggesting cerebral hypoxemia
dysrhythmic breathing typified cheyne stokes respiration
eponym refers periodic pattern alternating hyperpnea apnea
though times normal phenomenon seen infants elderly ascent altitude often reflection significant cardiac andor pleural nervous system dysfunction
breath volumes increased without substantial modification rate compensatory mechanism blunt effects metabolic acidosis occurs uncontrolled diabetes
occurs effort associated kussmaul breathing seems minimal
configuration chest may aid diagnostic process
typically pectus excavatum funnel chest counterpart pectus carinatum pigeon breast associated unequivocal physical findings rarely adverse impact pulmonary function
scars identify previous surgery trauma alert clinician need complete history event
called barrel chest deformity sometimes referred increased p diameter often erroneously interpreted associated presence pulmonary emphysema
several studies proved description necessarily associated underlying pulmonary disease regularly function weight loss mild kyphosis function aging process
breathing assessment changing chest shape helpful
presence intercostal retraction pursued lip breathing use accessory muscles suggest airways obstruction
paradoxical movement chest abdominal muscles alert clinician possible usefulness pulmonary physiotherapy improve ventilatory efficiency
grimaces expressions discomfort occurring point ventilatory cycle influence examiner identify origin discomfort precisely
finally wheezing heard examiner tidal volume breathing exaggerated breathing may reflection upper airway obstruction stridor severe lower airway narrowing
search dermatologic abnormalities also may lead one identification systemic pulmonary processes
palpation used screening technique means confirm specific diagnosis
light palpation entire thorax posteriorly laterally anteriorly aid identification cutaneous subcutaneous nodules site previously unsuspected tenderness
nodules firm freely moveable suggest focal benign inflammatory clinically insignificant problem
hard fixed multiple suggest metastatic malignancy
fleshy nodules may indicative systemic disease neurofibromatosis
tenderness may elicited maneuver
times unsuspected patient examiner
circumstances used aid diagnosis complaint chest pain
localizing rib fracture either traumatic pathologic reproducing chest pain costochondritis firm palpation inflamed costochondral junction may helpful planning management
tenderness inflamed infarcted area lung may also aid localization disease process
assessment ventilatory excursion includes evaluation synchrony expansion degree chest expansion associated deep forceful inspiration residual volume
asymmetrical expansion invariably implies decreased ventilation one side
may due thoracic wall abnormalities particularly either associated structural immobility defect thoracoplasty pain rib fracture
similarly problem may caused inflamed fibrosed malignantly infiltrated pleura unilateral pleural effusion interstitial pulmonary process complete obstruction airway airways ipsilateral side
functional severing phrenic nerve intraabdominal process causing paralysis ipsilateral hemidiaphragm may responsible asymmetrical expansion
asynchronous expansion may occur secondary processes usually occurs functional diaphragmatic impairment pain
palpation used assess abnormalities gynecomastia suspected observed breast enlargement confirmed palpation breast tissue
similarly spider hemangiomas confirmed central arterial supply seen feed spider radicals following manual occlusion
finally deviation trachea one side mean process either pulling trachea one side occurs lung volume loss lobar collapse atelectasis pneumothorax pushing trachea away might occur either tumor inflammatory mass
spontaneous movement trachea synchrony pulse suggests presence aortic aneurysm
percussion major aid assessment ventilatory exertion assessment hyperinflation presence focal thoracic disease
general percussion hemithorax give clue presence absence pulmonary process
percussion note hyperresonant one postulate lungs hyperinflated may occur emphysema called air trapping seen patients acute asthma
may also occur patients acute spontaneous pneumothorax
dullness percussion particularly associated presence high poorly moving diaphragm likely associated restrictive ventilatory defect findings bilaterally symmetrical
usually associated interstitial pulmonary process evaluated presence absence late inspiratory crackles auscultation
flatness percussion suggests virtual absence air directly beneath percussed finger may reflect either fluid pleural space pleural effusion empyema solid material pleural space fibrothorax mesothelioma atelectases
bronchial breath sounds may either normal abnormal
heard periphery vesicular breath sounds normally heard one imply airways lung units open lung units filled liquid like material
occurs without pleural fluid bronchial breath sounds loud consolidation associated pleural effusion bronchial breath sounds present often quite decreased intensity
confirmation presence bronchial breath sounds obtained listening egophony e sound
sound elicited asking patient say letter e one listens suspicious area stethoscope
consolidation present spoken e sound converted ausculted sound similar produced bleating goat
addition assessing quality breath sounds also important assess duration expiratory phase
timing duration expiratory sound listening diaphragm trachea forced expiratory volume maneuver used identify airways obstruction
expiratory sound terminate within seconds
sound prolonged airways obstruction manifested fev less
liters assumed
auscultatory wheezes imply presence slitlike openings critical velocity gas passing
wheezes local one must consider external compression airway
enlarged lymph nodes tumors
lesion within airway endobronchial malignancy foreign body also produce localized wheeze
diffuse wheezing present inflammatory processes bronchitis acute chronic contraction hypertrophied bronchial smooth muscle seen asthma inspissated thick secretions pneumonia airway collapse associated dynamic compression pulmonary emphysema
crackles imply snapping open airways alveoli
since larger airways open first inhalation progresses residual volume early inspiratory crackles imply large airways disease late inspiratory crackles either mean small airways problems less mm poorly compliant alveoli walls seen congestive heart failure pulmonary fibrosis interstitial pulmonary processes
gurgles suggest fluid airways
may produced excessive serous secretion alveolar cell carcinoma infected purulent secretion acute chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis transudated fluid entering airways alveoli occurs pulmonary edema
