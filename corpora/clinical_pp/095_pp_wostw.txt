diseases liver may result production auscultatory phenomena portal vein hypertension produced arterial blood flow increased partially obstructed liver involved inflammatory processes
conditions result production abdominal venous hum hepatic arterial bruit hepatic friction rub
patient examined supine position
abdomen carefully inspected presence dilated superficial veins caput medusae varicose veins radiating umbilicus
present lightly palpated presence thrill
thrill present venous hum present
thrill absent venous hum may may present
finally hum may present dilated veins seen
hum listened using light pressure bell diaphragm stethoscope
detected hum obliterated increasing pressure stethoscope compressing veins free hand
abdominal venous hum like cervical venous hum continuous roaring whining noise may localized abdomen may radiate chest
unlike cervical venous hum response abdominal venous hum change position respiration cardiac cycle valsalva maneuver unpredictable
instance valsalva maneuver obliterates cervical venous hum may increase decrease abdominal venous hum
essential abdominal venous hum confused respiratory noises bowel sounds
problem respiratory noises solved patient hold breath
bowel sounds quite confusing usually distinguished tinkling changing intermittent qualities
abdomen examined palpation percussion determine liver size location configuration
liver auscultated using moderately firm pressure either bell diaphragm stethoscope
arterial bruit may confined systole systolic extension diastole continuous
many causes abdominal arterial bruits difficult impossible sure bruit coming liver
however liver large stethoscope placed directly bruit heard locations away liver odds greatly favor bruit coming arterial blood flow within liver
patient examined size location configuration liver
light pressure examining hand used feel thrill liver related respiration
felt friction rub heard rub often heard felt
hepatic friction rub sounds close ear similar sound produced forcibly rubbing thumb forefinger together close ear
rub produced movement liver rub usually confined abdomen radiate chest
likewise friction rub caused movement pleura heard liver
abdominal venous hum results conditions cause portal vein hypertension
collateral venous channels opened portal systemic venous channels resultant flow blood high pressure portal system lower pressure systemic system way results hum
patient portal hypertension abdominal venous hum resulting congenitally atrophic liver patent umbilical vein condition called cruveilhier baumgarten disease
portal hypertension venous hum result cirrhosis liver causes condition known cruveilhier baumgarten syndrome
number reported cases cirrhosis absent small
hepatic arterial bruits result conditions cause increased arterial flow liver arteriovenous shunting liver partial obstruction arterial flow
primary metastatic tumors liver receive blood supply almost exclusively hepatic artery arterial flow conditions increased
alcoholic hepatitis cirrhosis liver associated increased arterial blood flow liver intrahepatic arteriovenous shunts
arterial bruits described conditions
cancer cirrhosis addition increased flow may cause bruits partial obstruction arterial flow regenerating cancerous nodules
liver dual blood supply hepatic artery portal vein rarely develops infarction large enough produce rub
therefore hepatic rubs result inflammation liver contiguous structures commonest causes infection cancer either primary metastatic
presence abdominal venous hum virtually diagnostic portal vein hypertension statistically secondary cirrhosis liver
venous hum radiates confined chest may mistaken obscure murmur cardiac origin
hepatic bruit indicative alcoholic hepatitis primary metastatic cancer
though reported occur cirrhosis liver rare without associated alcoholic hepatitis
abdominal venous hum hepatic arterial bruit patient would suggest cirrhosis liver alcoholic hepatitis cancer
friction rub liver indicative cancer liver inflammatory changes infection adjacent liver
detected young woman examiner consider gonococcal peritonitis upper abdomen fitz hugh curtis syndrome
hepatic rub bruit patient usually indicates cancer liver
hepatic rub bruit abdominal venous hum would suggest patient cirrhosis developed hepatoma
