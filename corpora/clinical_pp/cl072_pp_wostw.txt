hyporeflexia absent diminished response tapping
usually indicates disease involves one components two neuron reflex arc
hyperreflexia refers hyperactive repeating clonic reflexes
usually indicate interruption corticospinal descending pathways influence reflex arc due suprasegmental lesion lesion level spinal reflex pathways
convention deep tendon reflexes graded follows
response always abnormal
slight definitely present response may may normal
brisk response normal
brisk response may may normal
tap elicits repeating reflex clonus always abnormal
whether responses normal depends previously patient reflex history reflexes analysis associated findings muscle tone muscle strength evidence disease
asymmetry reflexes suggests abnormality
commonly used deep tendon reflexes presented group
screening examination usually find convenient integrate reflex examination rest examination part body upper extremity reflexes examining rest upper extremity
abnormality reflexes suspected discovered however reflexes examined group careful attention paid technique examination
valid test results best obtained patient relaxed thinking
general explanation mingle specific instructions questions comments designed get patient speak length topic
get response specific reflexankle jerks usually difficultthen try following
several different positions limb
get patient put slight tension muscle tested
one method achieving patient strongly contract muscle tested
upper extremity patient make fist one hand opposite extremity tested
reflex tested knee jerk ankle jerk patient perform jendrassik maneuver reinforcement reflex see gassel
patient fingers hand hooked together arm forcefully pull
split second ready tap tendon say pull
general way distract patient enhance chances obtaining reflex
patient count give names children examples
best position patient sitting side bed examining table

good
use brisk painful tap
use wrist arm action
extremity useful maneuver elicit reflex several different positions rapidly shifting limb performing test
use varying force note variance response
note following features reflex response
amount hammer force necessary obtain contraction velocity contraction strength contraction duration contraction duration relaxation phase response muscles tested
reflex hyperactive muscle often respond testing nearby muscle
good example reflex activity hyperactive biceps finger reflex brachioradialis tendon tapped
termed overflowing reflex
obtaining reflex one side always go immediately opposite side reflex compare

see dejong description numerous reflexes useful certain situations
stretch reflex contraction muscle response stretching muscle spindles receptors lie parallel extrafusal muscle fibers
reflex composed two neuron arc
afferent neuron whose cell body sensory ganglion innervates spindle
muscle spindle stretched neuron fires monosynaptically excites alpha motoneurons anterior horn spinal cord
alpha motoneuron second neuron supplies muscle tapped transiently stretched
detailed mechanisms underlying operation spindle quite complex considerable knowledge available literature new details added constantly
muscle spindle slender spindle shaped structure intermingled usual muscle fibers
spindle composed two types elongated poorly staining fibers nuclear bag fibers nuclear chain fibers
contains multiple nuclei
six ten fibers lie within spindle connective tissue sheath
called intrafusal muscle fibers since lie inside fusiform structure contrast surrounding extrafusal fibers make contractile element muscle
afferent sensory terminals innervate spindle fibers two types primary secondary figure
spindles fire according velocity amount stretch placed upon central nuclear regions intrafusal fibers
degree stretch communicated central portion fibers determined two factors length change length surrounding extrafusal fibers see figure
degree contraction intrafusal fibers see
impulses spindle receptors enter dorsal horn information takes four routes cortex synapse directly alpha motoneuron causes immediate contraction muscle innervated spindle agonist synapse inhibitory neuron turn synapses alpha motoneuron goes muscle antagonistic one innervated spindlethus concomitant relaxation antagonist agonist contracts cerebellum via dorsal spinocerebellar tracts
previous paragraph describes course taken afferent impulses sensory nuclei muscle spindles
recall second component spindle contractile element intrafusal fibers
firing spindle afferents dependent upon length extrafusal fibers outlined length intrafusal fibers
contraction ends intrafusal fibers thus strength central portions controlled gamma motoneurons small neurons located anterior horn influenced cerebellum cortex various brainstem nuclei
probable function motor innervation sensory structure enable supraspinal structures set thus ultimately regulate sensitivity spindle
higher centers particular cortex thereby get sensory information muscle spindles turn gamma motoneuron control amount quality information received
golgi tendon organ second major muscle receptor attached extrafusal fibers tendon
thus tendon organ series extrafusal fibers fire muscle contracts
spindles contrast parallel e alongside extrafusal fibers fire extrafusal fibers relax e stretched
impulses tendon organ go dorsal horn synapse inhibitory interneuron turn synapses alpha motoneuron goes agonist
therefore tendon organ ultimately causes relaxation agonist way interneurons facilitation antagonist
information also conveyed receptors cerebellum cortex
spinal reflexes set mechanisms described serve function keeping muscle fibers adjusted certain length certain tension thereby maintaining muscle tone ultimately limb posture
absent stretch reflexes indicate lesion reflex arc
associated symptoms signs usually make localization possible
absent reflexes sensory loss distribution nerve supplying reflex lesion involves afferent arc reflexeither nerve dorsal horn
absent reflex paralysis muscle atrophy fasciculations lesion involves efferent arcanterior horn cells efferent nerve
peripheral neuropathy today common cause absent reflexes
causes include diseases diabetes alcoholism amyloidosis uremia vitamin deficiencies pellagra beriberi pernicious anemia remote cancer toxins including lead arsenic isoniazid vincristine diphenylhydantoin
neuropathies predominantly sensory motor mixed therefore affect components reflex arc see adams asbury good discussion
muscle diseases produce disturbance stretch reflex unless muscle rendered weak contract
occasionally occurs diseases polymyositis muscular dystrophy
hyperactive stretch reflexes seen interruption cortical supply lower motor neuron upper motor neuron lesion
interruption anywhere segment reflex arc
analysis associated findings enables localization lesion
stretch reflexes provide excellent clues level lesions along neuraxis

lists segmental innervation common stretch reflexes
example biceps brachioradialis reflexes normal triceps absent lower reflexes finger jerk knee jerk ankle jerk hyperactive lesion would located c c level level triceps reflex
reflex arcs biceps brachioradialis jaw jerk functioning normally lower reflexes give evidence absence upper motor neuron innervation
laterality reflexes also helpful
example reflexes left side body hyperactive right side normal lesion interrupting corticospinal pathways side somewhere level highest reflex hyperactive
