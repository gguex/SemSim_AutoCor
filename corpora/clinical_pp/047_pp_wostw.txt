x rays form electromagnetic radiation
short wavelength located far ultraviolet band electromagnetic spectrum
standard x ray examination chest consists frontal pa lateral view
frontal view called pa view patient stands anterior chest cassette back x ray beam
x rays first hit posterior anterior chest hitting cassette thus name pa
cassette feet x ray tube
lateral film taken way except patient standing side perpendicular x ray cassette
unless otherwise specified left lateral taken
ap film chest usual technique patients ill leave bedside
usually taken cassette behind patient x ray beam rather inches cassette thus magnifying structures
apical lordotic technique used evaluate apices lungs
x ray beam angled slightly upward projection causing anterior thoracic structures projected posterior thoracic structures
clavicle first several sets ribs projected apices lung allowing good view area
particularly useful evaluating upper lobes evidence tuberculous disease
lateral decubitus technique one patient placed lying cassette either left right side dependent
frequently used evaluating presence free moving pleural fluid
usual technique patient lie side fluid look radiodense fluid line along dependent side
small amounts pleural fluid helpful patient lie normal side dependent see diaphragmatic angle involved side becomes sharp thus indicating presence small free moving effusion
closer intrathoracic structure cassette sharper accurate image cassette
x rays strike structures travel slightly divergent rather totally parallel manner
therefore distance object cassette greater amount magnification lesser sharpness object image represented cassette
hence cardiac silhouette appears larger less sharp ap pa film
similarly right sided process better defined right left lateral position
chest x ray taken optimal technique intervertebral spaces barely visible cardiac silhouette
intervertebral spaces apparent film relatively light
means existing infiltrate may seem prominent may appear infiltrate present fact normal vasculature
words light film likely overread
one clearly see intervertebral space outline vertebral bodies x ray somewhat overpenetrated
tends make infiltrate appear less prominent sometimes even cause infiltrate appreciated film
words dark film likely underread
guidelines underpenetration kept mind comparing progression resolution process serial films
wilhelm von roentgen described x rays ushered medical science new era technology
physicians united states already putting roentgen discovery clinical use
today chest x ray frequently requested radiologic examination accounting one quarter one third x ray procedures
indeed come long way since november day wurzburg roentgen made first observations magical rays could pass objects opaque light cause visible fluorescence
x rays produced bombarding tungsten filament electron beam
x rays visible light forms electromagnetic radiation different physical properties
different properties make x ray medically useful
specifically many substances opaque light penetrated x rays
x ray traverses thoracic cavity hits structures path part energy dissipated
thicker denser structure greater amount energy dissipated
traversed thoracic cavity x ray strikes film metallic silver precipitated photochemically within gelatinous emulsion film
clinical practice x ray film put cassette contains fluorescent coating front back
coating activated x rays cause emit light rays reinforce photochemical effect
x rays traverse thorax without going much tissue strike cassette relatively large amount energy cassette developed area black
conversely x ray passed dense thick thoracic structure much lower energy hits cassette look white
structures intermediate density thickness give intermediate gray appearances
varying shades black white gray provide contrast x ray film
film taken suboptimal x ray voltage e white underpenetrated film results x ray intrathoracic structures hazy borders difficult differentiate adjacent structures
conversely film taken much voltage e overpenetrated black x ray result radiograph relatively little contrast making differentiation intrathoracic structures difficult
examining chest x ray signs disease acquaint normal anatomy
right lung divided upper middle lower lobe left lung divided upper lower lobe
lingula anatomically part left upper lobe analog right middle lobe
lobes separated septa
visceral pleura surfaces adjacent lobes form interlobar septa
space called interlobar fissure although terms septum fissure used synonymously
septa average thickness
mm see figures
major oblique fissure lung separates lower lobes middle upper lobes right upper lobe left
major fissure usually seen lateral view normally runs level fifth thoracic vertebra fifth rib interspace crossing inferiorly anteriorly parallel sixth rib reach diaphragm centimeters behind anterior costophrenic angle
oblique fissure presents smooth concave surface courses around lung
anterior posterior deviation fissure often represents loss volume lung segment toward fissure deviated
minor horizontal fissure seen pa lateral chest x rays
pa view normal position second fourth anterior ribs presenting slightly convex horizontal appearance
loss volume minor fissure drawn normal horizontal position pulled upper lobe volume loss posteriorly lower lobe volume loss
assessment pulmonary vasculature difficult confusing task
pulmonary arterial segments converge toward hila meet right left main pulmonary arteries
left pulmonary artery slightly higher right time
means right hilum never normally higher left
right hilum higher left something either pulling pushing right hilum something pulling pushing left hilum
hila best appreciated lateral projection see figure
lateral view right left upper lobe bronchi seen two circular radiolucent areas right left
right pulmonary artery seen projecting anteriorly upper lobe bronchi left pulmonary artery projects posteriorly
inferior vena cava also frequently seen lateral view coursing left hemidiaphragm join posterior cardiac silhouette
pa projection superior vena cava sometimes seen coursing superiorly hila
right hemidiaphragm normally slightly higher left cases
diaphragm normally smooth convex contour tapers give sharp costophrenic angle
good inspiratory effort level diaphragm near level ninth posterior rib
trachea normally midline pa ap film
tracheal air shadow readily visible normal pa film normal circumstances spinous processes vertebral bodies located center tracheal lucency
tracheal air column deviated must determine secondary pathologic change rotation patient
well centered pa chest film ends clavicles equidistant spinous processes vertebral bodies
therefore notice deviation tracheal air column check spinous processes vertebral bodies maintain relationships clavicles
case true tracheal deviation patient rotated toward clavicle farthest spinous processes
chest x ray two dimensional static black white representation three dimensional dynamic living structure
job take two dimensional black white images reconstruct going inside patient chest
people accomplish pattern reading
involves learning radiologic patterns various pathologic entities
example one sees blunted costophrenic angle one instantly comes diagnosis pleural effusion
one sees fluffy mottled density right lower lobe comes diagnosis pneumonia
method lead correct diagnosis good percentage time someone faced difficult x ray sees something familiar total loss
similar programming computer recognize patterns giving pattern never seen
able come diagnosis
optimal way read x rays learn certain radiographic principles apply principles logical consistent manner reading x rays
almost always able come diagnosis even never seen
air water tissue bone three basic radiologic densities
air density represented lung parenchyma black x ray
bone density white x ray
water tissue density gray x ray
must keep mind thickness structure also affects projected density x ray film
even though heart less dense bone projected whiter chest x ray significantly thicker ribs vertebral bodies
see borders various intrathoracic structures difference contrast
dr
benjamin felson felson felson described famous silhouette sign intrathoracic lesion touching border heart aorta diaphragm obliterate border roentgenogram
intrathoracic lesion anatomically contiguous border one structures obliterate border
applied term silhouette sign indicate loss silhouette borders adjacent disease p
using silhouette sign one able locate pathologic process single x ray view
example right middle lobe infiltrate obliterate right heart border outlined silhouette sign whereas right lower lobe infiltrate
right middle lobe right heart border anterior adjacent structures water density structures borders two become obliterated
thus pa view chest locate structure superioinferior dimension well mediolateral dimension silhouette sign allows us locate posterioanterior dimension
corroborated looking lateral film
using systematic approach reading chest x ray one usually easily define pathology
define abnormality chest x ray asking series questions
first intraparenchymal extraparenchymal process
one see degrees around intraparenchymal process surrounded aerated lung thus providing contrast
definition extraparenchymal process one border either mediastinum diaphragm pleural surface one see degrees around
addition intraparenchymal processes usually projected pa ap film greater mediolateral dimension superioinferior dimensions
therefore second hallmark intraparenchymal process usually wider long
conversely extraparenchymal process either pleural mediastinal soft tissue space tends longer wide
next ask whether process mass infiltrate
differentiation easily made
mass homogeneously white density infiltrate mottled black white density
exception rule consolidation special form infiltrative process alveolar spaces involved bronchopulmonary segments involved thus giving homogeneously white appearance
process mass one see way around parenchymal mass
mass one see way around either hilar mediastinal pleural soft tissue process depending location
infiltrative process ask alveolar interstitial
hallmark alveolar filling process presence air bronchograms
air bronchogram another term coined dr
felson
states parenchymal consolidation may result visualization bronchi normally invisible since air within lumens stand contrast surrounding opaque lung p
finding air bronchograms area infiltration easy sounds frequently cause disagreement among radiologist clinician alike
easy way detect presence alveolar infiltrate use fact tends obliterate borders normal blood vessels area
silhouette sign described
alveolar filling process causes water density around blood vessels borders vessels visualized sharply
unlike alveolar infiltrate interstitial infiltrate tends accentuate vascular markings area infiltration
alveolar interstitial infiltrates opposite effects visibility pulmonary vasculature great help differentiation
although rules always hold true aid beginner inexperienced clinician making sense chest x ray
mastered basic radiologic principles interpretation let us put clinical use
exception pulmonary edema alveolar infiltrates tend localized whereas interstitial infiltrates tend diffuse
certain characteristics infiltrate may helpful differential diagnosis
location infiltrate prime importance
tuberculosis far common upper lobes lobes
addition tubercle bacillus favors superior posterior segments rarely seen anterior segment alone
superior segment lower lobes posterior segment upper lobes frequently involved segments aspiration pneumonia
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia frequently seen diffuse interstitial infiltrate
character infiltrate also important
consolidative infiltrate commonly seen bacterial pneumonia
presence multiple lucent areas within pneumonic infiltrate suggest necrotizing process
one would think tuberculosis proteus pseudomonas well anaerobic pulmonary infections
alveolar infiltrate area severe emphysema simulate necrotizing process dilated alveolar spaces emphysematous process simulate cavities
evaluating pulmonary mass important thing try exclude neoplastic process
presence dense central calcification one reliable signs mass malignant
calcified mass frequently represents old healed clinically inactive inflammatory process
calcium present one must rely previous chest x rays see long mass growing size
general rule mass seen older film unchanged size years likely benign process invasive investigation mass mandatory
old films show mass smaller previously growing present previously invasive investigation mandatory
mass chest x ray cigarette smoker considered cancer proven otherwise
true pulmonary mass pleural effusion mediastinal node smoker
cavitation within mass frequently represents either necrotizing infectious process cavitating neoplastic lesion
carcinoma cavitates walls mass thick irregular inflammatory process cavitates walls thinner regular
one difficult things determine whether hilar mass represents large pulmonary artery enlarged mediastinal node
pa ap projection clearly see vessels going joining mass likely vascular structure
one also perform fluoroscopy patient perform valsalva maneuver
structure compresses valsalva maneuver likely venous
similarly one appreciates pulsations structure likely arterial
nevertheless one must careful transmitted pulsations vascular structure underneath mass
lateral view far helpful view evaluating hilar area
large pulmonary arteries appreciated lateral view large vascular shadow described previously
tumorous enlargement hila area appreciated much earlier greater ease lateral
volume loss pulmonary parenchyma caused one three pathophysiologic processes obstruction compression contraction
obstruction lobar segmental bronchus result resorption air distal obstruction loss volume involved segments
seen commonly endobronchial carcinoma however extrabronchial masses cause bronchial obstruction extrinsic compression
compression parenchyma occurs pleural effusion pneumothorax
contraction scarring lung occurs sequela previous inflammatory process tuberculosis
compression may obvious signs pleural effusion pneumothorax
contraction interstitial infiltrate fibrous scarring
volume loss endobronchial obstruction several direct indirect radiologic signs
dr
felson thoroughly described radiologic signs obstructive volume loss see table
displacement fissures reliable sign volume loss
fissure displaced toward affected segment
example upper lobe collapse major fissure pulled superiorly anteriorly toward collapsed upper lobe lower lobe collapse major fissure pulled inferiorly posteriorly toward collapsed lower lobe
increase radiodensity affected segment occurs segment loses volume tissues segment come closer together hence dense
final direct sign volume loss vascular bronchial crowding effected segment
occurs reason increase radiodensity
indirect signs obstructive volume loss hila displacement reliable
hilum displaced upward upper lobe volume loss downward lower lobe volume loss
elevation hemidiaphragm pronounced lower lobe volume loss upper lobe volume loss
shift hilum mediastinal structures toward side major volume loss frequent
major volume loss one lobe adjacent lobe frequently overdistend take vacated space collapsed lobe
results overdistention normal segment giving radiolucent appearance
known compensatory emphysema
armed principles knowledge bronchial lobar anatomy one adequately evaluate lobar segmental collapse
pneumothorax air loculated visceral parietal pleura
air either introduced outside chest trauma inside bronchopleural fistula
hallmark pneumothorax area chest x ray pulmonary vasculature
one always feels secure making diagnosis one actually visualize lung parenchyma medial area pneumothorax however always case
sometimes necessary hot light film
involves putting film strong light source watt bulb look edge lung
increased light behind x ray sometimes see lung edge appreciated view box
small amounts pneumothorax appreciable shift lung mediastinal structures
larger amounts pneumothorax lung mediastinum pushed toward contralateral chest volume pressure within pneumothorax increases
results deviation trachea mediastinal structures well compression contralateral lung extreme degrees pneumothorax
critical situation known tension pneumothorax
immediate therapeutic measures must taken decompress affected side point
one condition causes confusion pneumothorax extensive bullous disease lung
bulla cysts lung large air containing sacks within lungs
end results various pathophysiologic processes
sometimes bulla cysts reach huge proportions simulate pneumothorax
bulla cysts contain air see pulmonary vasculature within however look carefully appreciate walls bulla cysts radiograph
none pneumothorax
times difficult differentiation
