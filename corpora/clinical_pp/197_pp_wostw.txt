hypophosphatemia causes decreased absorption calcium renal tubules leading hypercalciuria
addition hypophosphatemia alters renal acid base status four possible mechanisms depressed proximal tubular reabsorption bicarbonate leading bicarbonate wasting impaired distal tubular acidification decreased buffer excretion due low phosphate excretion diminished renal ammoniagenesis
disorders phosphate homeostasis occur wide range clinical conditions
hyper hypophosphatemia caused cellular shifts phosphate
three primary conditions lead phosphate dysfunction dietary intake gi renal status
since serum inorganic phosphate minute portion body phosphate alterations serum level occur body phosphate low normal high
common causes hyperphosphatemia summarized table
apart cellular shifts hyperphosphatemia occurs presence renal insufficiency decrease phosphate excretion
chronic renal failure significant hyperphosphatemia seen gfr fallen mlmin although early phosphate retention causes decrease ionized calcium leading increased parathyroid hormone initiation whole cascade events ultimately produce renal osteodystrophy
hyperphosphatemia occurs several endocrine conditions associated increased tubular reabsorption phosphate
pseudohypoparathyroidism failure parathyroid hormone act renal tubules resulting high tm responsible high serum phosphate presence abnormal circulating parathyroid hormone
acromegaly excess growth hormone leads increased tubular reabsorption phosphate
clinical situations high serum phosphate increased tubular reabsorption phosphate
thus magnesium deficiency decreased release parathyroid hormone producing picture similar hypoparathyroidism
tumoral calcinosis condition seen frequently blacks appears primary increased tubular reabsorption phosphate normal gi absorption calcium
administration vitamin analogs increased absorption calcium phosphate gastrointestinal tract degree renal insufficiency hyperphosphatemia may result

common causes hypophosphatemia listed table
hypophosphatemia seen frequently hospitalized patients
three primary mechanisms leading hypophosphatemia transcellular shift phosphorus extracellular volume either soft tissues bones poor dietary intake especially associated impaired gi absorption diarrhea increased phosphate excretion resulting renal nonrenal causes
nonrenal loss occurs gut primarily malabsorptive states diarrheal conditions
simple deficiency vitamin lead rickets childhood osteomalacia adults along poor phosphate absorption
phosphate binders nonabsorbable antacids containing aluminum bind phosphorus gut block absorption ingested secreted phosphate
major losses phosphorus occur kidneys
usual cause renal phosphate wasting excess parathyroid hormone reduces maximum renal tubular reabsorption phosphorus
defects may congenital acquired
among congenital defects best known fanconi syndromea proximal tubular disorder producing phosphaturia glycosuria aminoaciduria uricosuria bicarbonaturia
similar picture may also seen cystinosis wilson disease hereditary fructose intolerance glycogen storage disease
acquired defects include multiple myeloma amyloidosis heavy metal intoxication
postrenal transplantation state secondary hyperparathyroidism may exist high circulating parathyroid hormone resulting phosphate wasting normal renal tubules
state may persist several months
vitamin resistant rickets believed caused phosphate leak renal tubules along defective intestinal absorption phosphate
renal tubular wasting also occur extracellular volume expansion saline bicarbonate
picture seen diuretic phase acute tubular necrosis use diuretic agents
several clinical settings hypophosphatemia may result combination factors
diabetic ketoacidosis initially higher serum phosphate due acidosis
treatment increased urinary excretion along translocation phosphate cells administration insulin glucose
hypophosphatemia may seen patients hospitalized chronic alcoholism
mechanisms include poor dietary intake vomiting diarrhea well magnesium deficiency ketoacidosis effect ethanol per se
alcoholic ketoacidosis probably produces decomposition intracellular organic phosphate release phosphate leading phosphaturia
severe burns hypophosphatemiais usually seen second fifth day injury may persist ten days
mechanism hypophosphatemia known may include respiratory alkalosis resulting gram negative sepsis renal phosphate wasting secondary volume expansion increased calcitonin catecholamine levels
similarly patients recovering starvation nutritional recovery maintained intravenous nutrition especially without phosphates anabolism leads cellular uptake phosphate
times may marked symptomatic hypophosphatemia
urinary phosphate determination valuable guide diagnosis hypophosphatemia
kidneys avidly conserve phosphate hypophosphatemia present may produce virtually phosphate free urine
thus serum level phosphate low
mgdl
mmoll increased urinary phosphorus excretion higher
mmoldl fractional excretion inappropriate clearly indicates renal wasting
contrast urinary phosphate low setting low serum phosphate e urinary phosphate excretion less
