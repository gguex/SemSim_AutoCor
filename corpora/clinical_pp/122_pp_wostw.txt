otalgia ear pain external ear temporal bone may occur multiple causes many remote ear
otorrhea ear drainage indicates inflammation external middle ear
otorrhea may clear sanguinous mucoid purulent
ascertain etiology otalgia accurately detailed history relating ear dental sinus jaw neck tongue mouth neurologic disorders head neck region must taken
symptoms referable one sites usually point likely etiology listed table
acute chronic recurrent pain may present
sensation may vary deep aching sharp quick lancing discomfort
vague fullness may present may blocked feeling ear
acute sudden pain may accompanied fever nasal congestion nasal ear drainage headache
chronic pain usually exists fewer associated complaints noted
tinnitus dizziness hearing impairment commonly seen recurrent ear pain
pain may seem deep penetrating within canal may diffuse extend either anterior posterior pinna
patient may volunteer neck motion chewing swallowing coughing nose blowing valsalva maneuver flying aggravate precipitate discomfort
ear pain without obvious physical findings must followed periodic intervals source located
since patients pain dental sources dental referral often needed
insidious dental infection decay may difficult identify well remote causes must often pursued one visit
careful history needed determine environmental factitious causes familial disorders
patient asked describe onset duration amount quality otorrhea
questions asked presence childhood ear disease trauma possible foreign bodies assorted upper respiratory symptoms
previous surgery ear sinus pharynx noted
questions dermatitis areas body asked
drug intake must documented associated treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy must noted
excessive water exposure may found
ear must cleaned meticulously small suction tips wire applicators order permit adequate inspection evaluation eardrum middle ear
mastoid x rays may needed rule associated middle ear mastoid disease
impedance audiometry may help determination also
studies diabetes needed chronic cases recurrent candida infections

small portion auricle superior anterior walls external canal anterior part tympanic membrane supplied third branch auriculotemporal branch third division trigeminal nerve
practically whole surface auricle receives sensory innervations great auricular lesser occipital nerves
inferior posterior walls external canal posterior portion tympanic membrane supplied sensory fibers auricular branch vagus nerve
generally correct state ganglionic representation sensation auricle external canal divided gasserian ganglion front second third cervical ganglia behind jugular ganglion
tympanic plexus lies promontory formed mainly nerves derived tympanic branch glossopharyngeal nerve also receives branches geniculate ganglion facial nerve
sympathetic branches carotid plexus join tympanic plexus although sensory function doubtful
skin overlying mastoid innervated mastoid branches great auricular lesser occipital nerves cells mastoid receive sensory supply mastoid branch tympanic plexus
sensory branches trigeminal structures within middle ear questionable
referred pain pathways responsible cases otalgia involve three cranial nerves innervate external auditory canal middle ear
painful impulses originating region diseased lower molar tooth temporomandibular joint would traced way gasserian ganglion spinal nucleus trigeminal fifth cranial nerve brainstem
nucleus also connects ear structures way sensory branches third division innervate wall external canal tympanum
irritative impulses tongue tonsil travel glossopharyngeal ninth cranial nerve ganglia enter somatic sensory nucleus nerve within medulla

otherwise localized reference pain observed clinically would occur
beyond certain level sensory irritation seems overflow adjacent centers diffuse poorly localized pain

infection trauma produce ear drainage
various causes listed table reader referred reference list detailed discussion specific cause
pain ear may divided intrinsic extrinsic causes denoting site origin
intrinsic causes table
usually documented direct examination ear
extrinsic causes produce pain ear reflex lesions remote ear
often referred reflex referred otalgia
order interpret significance referred pain ear necessary know nerve supply ear know organs related nerves distributed see basic science
lesions ear rarely produce pain distant areas many remote areas refer pain ear
patient complains earache though normal external canal drum number sources pain come mind
one half cases cause dental origin either occurring teeth temporomandibular joint
joint common site pain followed lower molar teeth
lesions anterior two thirds tongue inflammatory conditions parotid gland refer pain along auricular branch auriculotemporal nerve
referred pain submaxillary lingual salivary glands via lingual nerve may cause pain front ear
inflammation anterior one third tongue may cause pain front ear whereas ulceration posterior one third tongue beginning carcinoma may cause pain within ear
explained referral two different nerve sources
patients acute chronic infections tonsils frequently complain otalgia
lesions palate pharynx nasopharynx especially region eustachian tube often produce pain deep ear occasionally growths tonsil give rise earache first symptom
otalgia often earliest sign beginning malignancy nasopharynx
ninth cranial nerve involved referred pain pattern
ulcerative lesions entrance larynx tuberculosis malignancy may cause reflex otalgia secondary irritation superior laryngeal branch vagus nerve
ear examined carefully

acute chronic forms thyroiditis may present throat ear pain tenderness maximal thyroid lobe side
inflammation carotid bulb carotidynia often presents similar manner
unsuspected source otalgia elongation styloid process protrusion tonsillar fossa eagle syndrome
