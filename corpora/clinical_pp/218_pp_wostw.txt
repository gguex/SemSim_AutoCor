gram stain sputum perhaps accurate way diagnosing pulmonary infections
always organisms nasopharynx culture sputum often appear positive bacterial microorganism
culture positivity may misleading cases influenza mycoplasma legionella pneumonia
contrast anaerobes etiologic agents aspiration pneumonia presence revealed routine sputum culture techniques
examination gram stained sputum demonstrate whether bacterium present predominant species whether sputum contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggestive bacterial infection
presence numerous large squamous cells even filled bacteria indicates specimen contaminated saliva therefore inappropriate diagnostic purposes
sputum collected either freshly coughed specimen via aspiration nasotracheal tube following rapid instillation ml normal saline
transtracheal aspiration rarely necessary obtain sputum
sample sputum spread slide applicator stick compressing specimen two slides
specimen dried air heat fixed gram stained described csf one exception
sputum specimen thick thin areas
one attempts decolorize thick areas completely thin areas may decolorized
therefore one leave thickest areas sputum blue
examined microscope best area search organisms one nuclei leukocytes pink
cases bacterial pneumonia one note many polymorphonuclear leukocytes marked preponderance one morphologic type organism pneumococcal pneumonia one see gram positive diplococci exclusion almost bacterial forms
exception occurs cases aspiration pneumonia one sees many different types organisms indicative many types aspirated mouth
implications different patterns seen sputum gram stain given table
examination urine presence infection involves finding wbcs andor bacteria
unlike csf urine usually contains wbcs easily contaminated bacteria
hence proper assessment requires special steps collection preparation storage specimen
using simple techniques one show urinary tract infection exists make educated guess probable offending organism therefore appropriate therapy
repeating procedures hours start treatment one may also decide chosen therapy effective
many cases accomplished microbiology laboratory reported results initial culture
patients urine examined presence infection fall two groups without indwelling urinary catheters
patients without catheters midstream clean voided specimen recommended
periurethral area first cleansed soap solution get rid contaminating resident flora rinsed sterile water saline avoid antibacterial effects soap urine cultured
avoid contamination urine feces female patients essential cleansing periurethral area done urethral meatus toward perineum never reverse direction
male important retract foreskin present cleaning periurethral area
cleansing agents soap containing hexachlorophene e g phi hex quaternary ammonium compounds e g zephiran avoided
former may dry urethra making susceptible infection latter easily contaminated pseudomonas
importance midstream specimen initial voiding washes bacteria normally reside distal urethra
patients cooperate urine may obtained passing temporary catheter
done using sterile technique cleansing procedures detailed
patient indwelling catheter proper method obtaining urine swab port alcohol aspirate urine using sterile syringe
port provided syringe small gauge needle used
case distal rubber part closed drainage system cleaned alcohol pledget rubber tubing punctured urine withdrawn
make sure lumen tube draining bladder entered rather tube lumen leads inflated balloon
ensure catheter must punctured distal bifurcation trifurcation
tubing system never disconnected obtain urine closed modern urine collection systems play major role preventing infection catheterized patients
plastic part draining system punctured self seal
urine diagnosis infection never obtained collection bag
urine fresh often contaminated bacteria regardless presence absence urinary tract infection
urine centrifuged gram stain
gram stain prepared follows
drop unspun urine placed clean slide allowed dry without smearing
specimen heat fixed stained described csf figure
approximation wbcs usually made centrifuging urine examining drop sediment high dry objective microscope without prior staining
staining urine sent culture confirm presence type number bacteria
urine cultured immediately must stored refrigerator high colony counts merely reflect bacterial replication urine collected
colony count organisms per milliliter correlates well evidence infection
unusual see bacteria gram stain urine unless organisms number ml
putting two facts together one sees bacteria gram stained urine one assume organisms exceed ml therefore likelihood infection high
two common bacterial types gram negative rods gram positive cocci
latter may seen short chains signifying streptococci probably enterococci
gram positive cocci clusters probably staphylococci
saprophiticus recognized common lower urinary tract pathogen
gram negative rods usually identifiable gram stain except experts
gram negative cocci may belong genus acinetobacter
exact enumeration wbcs urine helpful establishing presence urinary tract infection
wbcs per high power field may found noninfected urine suggestive infection
studies indicated bacterial enumeration presence wbcs unspun urine carries clinical significance
speciation organism may useful identifying site origin whether result relapse reinfection
laboratory work also provide information antibiotic sensitivity organism
however one necessarily alter initial therapy patient well repeat urine gram stain fails reveal organisms
many antibiotics concentrated urine effective even vitro sensitivity tests would predict failure
estimation gram stain organisms per milliliter urine yields high degree certainty patient urinary tract infection
conversely finding many organisms used proof patient free infection
two groups relatively low bacterial counts occur presence infection females lower tract infections called urethral syndrome patients indwelling urinary catheters
catheterized patients replication time organism decreased bladder urine exits immediately via catheter
females lower urinary tract infections
saprophiticus common pathogen frequent voiding may similarly responsible relatively lower colony counts
physician must use clinical criteria presence pyuria sometimes recurrent finding low numbers organism decide patient infected
course many infections microorganisms enter bloodstream
infected patients blood may site organisms cultured
blood cultures taken hospitalized patients severe infections urinary tract lungs abdominal viscera bones central nervous system vascular tree
infections endocarditis two three sets blood cultures sufficient
endocarditis suspected five sets cultures recommended
set blood cultures usually two bottles per set one aerobic one anaerobic culture different venipuncture
blood cultures drawn period several hours day
practice drawing one large syringe blood aliquoting many blood culture bottles inadequate
contamination occurs aliquoting blood cultures positive organism diagnostic significance multiple positive cultures derived several sites different periods time
arms preferred site drawing blood cultures
either antecubital fossa distal spot may used
area prepared first alcohol iodine containing solution allowed dry venipuncture performed
necessary palpate area locate vein venipuncturist either wear sterile gloves prepare fingers contaminate area
blood drawn transferred appropriate bottles without changing needles swabbing tops bottles disinfectant
needle used venipuncture bottle tops sterile
additional handling increases chances contamination introduction bactericidal material culture bottle
sure place adequate volume blood ml culture bottle
routine blood cultures usually permit diagnosis reached
two additional techniques may prove rapidly useful cases suspected bacteremia
first search pustular lesions extremities
pustular acnei form lesions common face trunk normal uninfected people
however rare extremities especially hands feet may clue bacteremic disease
found lesions gently swabbed alcohol unroofed aspirated syringe needle contents gram stained
organisms identified immediate tentative diagnosis made
material sent confirmatory culture determination antibiotic sensitivity
approach useful cases gonococcal meningococcal pneumococcal sepsis
second technique gram stain buffy coat
whole blood centrifuged determining hematocrit wbcs concentrated white layer interface plasma erythrocytes
layer called buffy coat
presence high level bacteremia circulating leukocytes may contain phagocytized organisms
one break microhematocrit tube area buffy coat express drop wbc rich blood onto slide smear gram stain
although low yield procedure e positive bacteremias staphylococcal meningococcal bacteremias blood colony counts may high easy give immediate diagnostic results
