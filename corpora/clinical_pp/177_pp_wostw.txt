cytopathologist give accurate interpretation cellular sample adequate well preserved
renders disservice patient accepts interprets poorly obtained specimen
following material needed
glass pipette rubber bulb spatula diagonally cut tongue depressor preferably made wood cells tendency slide surface smooth plastic metal instrument glass slides one frosted end container saline container ethanol spray fixative
number precautions taken ensure specimens correctly obtained processed
first taking specimen name identification number patient clearly written frosted end slides lead pencil
smear taken patient placed individual bottle fixative prevent possible cellular cross contamination mixup specimens
properly identified requisition completed include brief history patient least age date last menstrual period recorded
talcum powder washed away gloves touching patient instruments slides
contaminant talcum crystal smear may hide diagnostic cell specimen
speculum introduced without lubricant
saline solution may used moistening
lubricant dissolve processing slide
often stains dark purple may hide numerous cells
scraping wooden spatula dipped saline moisten prevent rapid dehydration scraped cells
smeared slide dropped immediately ethyl alcohol sprayed chance air dry
adequate amount spray used cover whole surface thick coating
slide mailed remain ethanol least minutes longer hours
removed air dried placed cardboard mailer
sprayed coat fixative allowed dry completely closing cover cardboard mailer otherwise slide may stick surface dry cardboard absorb part cellular moisture
may result unsatisfactory air dried distorted cells
furthermore chance breakage slide transfer increased
smear accidently allowed air dry place fixative
mail
cells rehydrated lab air drying cellular distortions fixed forever
besides preceding general approach additions variations may required depending purpose test
routine pap smear detect occult cervical lesions figure several drops endocervical secretions obtained either aspiration glass pipette fitted rubber bulb using wooden spatula special elongated tip
drops placed middle prepared slide smeared
small end spatula introduced endocervical os deeply possible rotated degrees energetically scraping entire surface external os part endocervical canal mucosa
postmenopausal women cases endometrial lesion suspected droplets vaginal pool secretion added mixture smearing
immediately drop smeared slide gently bottle ethanol fixative spray chance air dry
diagnosis visible ulcerated fungating cervical lesions margins top fungating tumor bottom ulcerated lesion energetically scraped
otherwise often specimen contain nondiagnostic serum precipitate cellular debris inflammatory cells
occasional malignant cells usually degenerated proper interpretation
vaginal pool secretion smear often rewarding endocervical aspiration smear cases
pap test done hormonal evaluation healthy intact surface lateral wall upper third vagina gently scraped smeared fixed immediately
smear taken ulcerated grossly inflamed area cervix
pap test also used detection endometrial lesions
pickup rate endometrial adenocarcinoma use routine cervical scraping technique
degree detection reaches endometrial cavity sampled instrument crosses endocervical mucous plug dislodges endometrial cells
nondisposable killian antrum cannula isaac endometrial cell sampler disposable mi mark helix muenzer endometrial device washing saline endometrial cavity gravlee jet washing produce excellent endometrial cellular samples experienced careful hands
pap test used diagnosis vulvar lesions majority lesions moistened scraping
dripping wet compress sterile water left several minutes lesion makes softer easier scraping also cleans lesion removing nondiagnostic crusted loose degenerated cellular debris serum precipitate
removal crust dome vesicle margins ulceration energetically scraped sharp curette smeared immediately alcohol moistened slide
continuous renewal tissues body produces unceasing desquamation old diseased unwanted cells
majority cells either lost epithelial surface phagocytized histiocytes destroyed passage gastrointestinal tract
small portion cells accumulate natural body cavities recesses suspended preserved physiologic body secretions exudates
study cells recognition alterations produced normal aging various diseases including carcinomas conceived nineteenth century pouchet came publication work georges nicolas papanicolaou name pap test derives papanicolaou
success usefulness pap test gynecology expansion disciplines naib amply demonstrated last years use
become important tool detection clinically unsuspected diseases high degree sensitivity specificity confirmation nature clinically suspected diseases minimal trauma monitoring course diagnosed diseases responses therapy
better institutions sponsorship world health organization classification cervical lesions originally employed successfully papanicolaou replaced classification similar rendered pathologists examining histologic sections tissue biopsies
numbering system often abused misunderstood never used without comment meaning drake
class iii interpretation especially often served convenient way hide ignorance indecision cytopathologist
variation nomenclature cytologic reports becomes less significant cytopathologist full member team made clinician histopathologist colposcopist oncologist
provided speak frequently one another use language terminology able determine best treatment patient
pap test complements tissue biopsy tests compete
advantages limitations
pap test inexpensive rapid simple obtain process
produces injury tissues
allows frequent repetition cellular sampling especially important evaluation progressive posttreatment regression disease
contains samples cells originating wider surface area obtained biopsy
areas inaccessible easy biopsy bottom endocervical glands endometrial tubal mucosa ovarian surface may exfoliate diagnostic cells found routine genital smears
certain hormonal states better evaluated cytology biopsy
nature various genital inflammations infections often easier diagnose pap test biopsy
fungi parasites often visible smear
changes due irradiation forms therapy often better evaluated exfoliated cells histologic sections
certain limitations pap smear make biopsy preferred technique situations
relation abnormal cells supporting stroma blood lymphatic vessels important diagnosis invasive carcinoma determined cytology
cellular criteria used determination possible invasion
location lesion pinpointed cytology
example diagnostic squamous cancer cells may originate cervix vagina even vulva urethra
size lesion approximated cytology
number diagnostic cells smear often little relation size lesion
nature tumor e g poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma compared adenocarcinoma sarcoma difficult determine
sample cells studied may originate unwanted site example rectal urethra vulvar cells may contaminate vaginal smears
screening smear time consuming nature lesion obvious scattered cells histologic section
exfoliated cells may represent true nature tumor
example neoplasm mixed components often exfoliate one type diagnostic cells
value pap test naturally judged number times produces right diagnosis
dependability based experience knowledge honesty cytopathologist one hand enthusiasm active cooperation clinician
clinician responsible choice best rather convenient cheapest laboratory process smears
discrepancies cytologic diagnosis may due
absence recognizable diagnostic cells smear sampling processing error apparent false negative report misinterpretation cytotechnologist cytopathologist true nature diagnostic cells present smear true false negative report misinterpretation nature benign cell rather sampling failure false positive report
incidence false negative positive results varies one laboratory another
concern
accurate follow screened patients essential shared laboratory
