neurologic symptom symptom complex caused cerebral ischemia hemorrhage commonly called cerebrovascular accident cva stroke
cardinal clinical features sudden subacute onset except subarachnoid hemorrhage focal neurologic deficit
depending patient seen underlying cause deficit may stable progressive completely resolved
except common features cerebrovascular diseases diverse group disorders classified according etiology location duration symptoms
cerebrovascular diseases subdivided ischemic events cerebral hemorrhages many etiologies table
ischemic events classified according whether symptoms occurred carotid vertebrobasilar distribution table
duration symptoms
transient ischemic attacks tias seldom last minutes never hours
ischemic stroke neurologic deficit present hours may progressive stable resolving
history cerebrovascular disease important specific therapy may indicated prevent events history cerebrovascular disease may marker underlying disease especially coronary artery disease
cerebrovascular event usually results patient seeking medical attention
patients tias may seek help however history tias may come light asking ever temporary episodes weakness numbness visual problems speech difficulty
ophthalmic artery branch carotid syndrome amaurosis fugax fleeting blindness risk factor carotid events
therefore patients asked ever temporarily lost vision one eye sensation shade pulled vision one eye
past history completed stroke usually elicited merely asking ever stroke
term understood large percentage population
occasionally detailed questioning specific persistent neurologic symptoms necessary
patient encouraged relate story event spontaneously words
direct questioning may necessary assess symptoms onset whether progressed long lasted
ask medical help sought diagnostic procedures performed conclusive diagnosis made
questions aimed differentiating ischemic stroke hemorrhage asked headache stiff neck vomiting clouding consciousness onset
ischemic events vascular system affected determined asking specific symptoms caused dysfunction carotid vertebrobasilar systems
time since last event important risk ischemic stroke greatest weeks immediately following tias
common cause ischemic stroke atherosclerotic disease
hence patient questioned risk factors especially hypertension
causes ischemic stroke always kept mind especially emboli cardiac source since treatment different
therefore history chest pain symptoms suggestive mi congestive cardiomyopathy valvular disease atrial fibrillation sought
symptoms occurred multiple vascular distributions embolic events related cardiac disease especially considered
history recent illness trauma sought case patient might one rare causes ischemic stroke
recognizing special situation subarachnoid hemorrhage critical recurrent hemorrhage fatal high proportion cases
often focal neurologic signs sudden severe generalized headache often followed stiff neck vomiting altered consciousness
finally ask residual deficit previous event patient current functional capacity assessed assist planning rehabilitative efforts
cerebrovascular diseases heterogeneous group disorders variable natural history
outcome depends many factors including underlying pathophysiology collateral cerebral circulation concurrent illness especially heart disease
cerebrovascular events ischemic origin associated atherosclerotic disease
risk ischemic event increases age correlated systolic diastolic blood pressure diabetes history ischemic heart disease previous stroke
epidemiologic studies identified hypertension important risk factor stroke
correlation cigarette smoking hyperlipoproteinemia less conclusive
although stroke still third leading cause death united states incidence declining fact attributed better identification control hypertension
atherosclerosis commonly involves large extracranial vessels arise aortic arch
although carotid bifurcations frequently involved atherosclerosis also occur origins common carotid vertebral arteries intracranial vessels including carotid siphon basilar artery
atherosclerosis probably results ischemic symptoms several mechanisms
widely accepted platelet activation aggregation site ulcerated complex atherosclerotic plaque production thromboxane arachnidonic acid resulting platelet aggregation
aggregated platelets embolize specific symptoms dependent vessel embolization
severity symptoms depends duration vessel occlusion degree collateral flow tiny leptomeningeal end artery anastomoses
atherosclerosis may also result vessel stenosis occlusion
situation symptoms depend largely rapidly stenosis develops extent collateral flow available circle willis extracranial intracranial anastomoses
availability collaterals varies considerably among different people thus degree stenosis occlusion result different symptoms
example total occlusion internal carotid artery may asymptomatic one individual result disastrous stroke patient congenital absence portions circle willis
factors probably important determining outcome blood viscosity blood glucose blood oxygen carrying ability tissue metabolic demand
often ulcerated plaque stenosis coexist
symptoms probably result embolization since vessel stenosis must greater account symptoms hemo dynamic basis
patients different mechanism may result symptoms
pathologic examination surgical specimens atherosclerotic plaque removed carotid endarterectomy shows high frequency recent hemorrhage plaque event may precipitated acute stenosis embolization
stenosis small intracranial arteries also result ischemic symptoms
patients hypertension diabetes develop atherosclerosis small intracranial arteries
common occurrence development hypertension related lipohyalinosis fibrinoid necrosis small end arteries arterioles
results occlusion available collateral flow tiny lacunar stroke results
among many lacunar syndromes pure motor hemiparesis without dysarthria due lesions internal capsule pons pure sensory stroke due lesions thalamus
patients lacunar strokes almost never field defects aphasia higher cortical function loss
emboli heart cause ischemic strokes
although many cardiac conditions predispose cerebral embolization table two common atrial fibrillation acute myocardial infarction
risk stroke increased five times patients atrial fibrillation fifteen times associated mitral stenosis
strokes complicate acute myocardial infarctions approximately time
risk highest patients large infarctions congestive heart failure anterior infarctions hypokinesis left ventricular apex
emboli usually lodge end arteries poor collateral circulation therefore often cause major neurologic deficits
middle cerebral artery distribution usually affected
rare causes ischemic stroke include hematologic disorders polycythemia thrombocytosis dysproteinemias sickle cell disease fibromuscular dysplasia carotid dissections intracranial vasculitis several etiologies lupus erythematosus giant cell arteritis syphilitic arteritis granulomatous angiitis
clinical clues past history usually help identify unusual conditions
ischemic events divided brief completely reversible events called transient ischemic attacks tias completed strokes
therapeutic goals latter aimed preventing treating complications maximizing recovery rehabilitation therapeutic goal tias prevention serious events
tias usually caused small platelet cholesterol emboli temporarily occlude vessel break move distally
process may actually visualized ophthalmoscopically branches ophthalmic artery following amaurosis fugax
tias known risk factors subsequent ischemic stroke patients developing stroke
unfortunately uniformly reliable way predict patients go infarction
risk highest first months tia rapid therapeutic intervention indicated
risk stroke especially high cases crescendo tias sometimes precede total vessel occlusion
development saccular aneurysms circle willis thought occur gradually bifurcation sites arterial media may congenitally absent
internal elastic lamina locations becomes fragmented possibly accelerated atherosclerosis
aneurysms predilection certain locations especially posterior communicating artery anterior communicating artery middle cerebral artery
multiple cases
progressive enlargement seldom causes symptoms unless aneurysm compresses adjacent structure example oculomotor nerve posterior communicating artery aneurysm
aneurysms may found incidentally autopsy asymptomatic aneurysms discovered patients evaluated conditions rupture rate per year
patients already suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage risk rebleeding high first days drops slowly per year first months
rebleeding prevented costs since mortality rate high
congenital cerebral arteriovenous malformations avms consist malformed thin walled hyalinized vessels adjacent gliosis neuronal degeneration
avms may never rupture often come clinical attention cause seizure disorder rather hemorrhage
mortality rebleeding risk less saccular aneurysms
peak incidence hemorrhage avms age incidence aneurysm rupture peaks ages
etiology intracranial hematomas due hypertension unknown
many cases lipohyalinosis fibrinoid necrosis probably cause weakness arteriolar media subsequent rupture
events may due microscopic charot bouchard aneurysms small arteries arterioles
hypertensive hematomas recur
syndrome recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage described syndrome amyloid angiopathy condition unknown etiology consisting amyloid deposits vessel walls elderly persons often associated dementia
intracerebral hemorrhage also occurs trauma anticoagulant use bleeding dyscrasias
rare causes include hemorrhage brain tumor infarction
patients cause hemorrhage determined
although many intracerebral hematomas devastating events patients small hematomas reasonable prognosis functional recovery
cerebrovascular disorders diverse group illnesses managed different ways accurate diagnosis critical
following points important proper diagnosis management
establish cerebrovascular event actually occurred determine location event
decide event ischemic hemorrhagic
determine steps necessary medical stabilization patient
determine underlying pathophysiology caused event e g atherosclerosis embolus aneurysm
determine done prevent future possibly devastating events
decide occurrence cerebrovascular event may indicate underlying disease especially cardiac diseases
fixed deficit already exists establish patient potential rehabilitation
occasionally conditions mimic cerebrovascular events
primary metastatic tumors usually progress insidiously occasionally symptoms begin acutely rapid tumor growth hemorrhage tumor seizure followed focal neurologic signs
seizures may especially confusing may first symptom brain tumor also accompany acute stroke cases
although neuroradiologic procedures usually differentiate stroke tumor occasionally small tumors overlooked follow ct mri scan suggested ambiguous cases
distinguishing tia stroke migrainous phenomena may also difficult
latter usually occur younger individuals clear history vascular headaches
insidious onset tia stroke gradual spread symptoms
migrainous events usually transient permanent neurologic deficits hemiparesis sensory deficit aphasia occasionally attributed migraine
diagnostic problems may arise transient visual neurologic events accompanied headache occur older patients
although attempt made decide episode migrainous inquiring rate progression neurologic symptom previous history vascular headaches history classic visual events scintillating scotoma family history migraine cases clear differentiation made
final difficult area patients vague nonlocalized neurologic events
definition cva acute subacute onset focal neurologic event remembered patients syncope transient confusion anxiety nonspecific symptoms given diagnosis
patients ischemic stroke tia underlying cause often determines therapy
therefore necessary distinguish events due atherosclerosis embolic events cardiac origin lacunar strokes strokes due rare conditions
atherosclerosis systemic arterial problem stroke tia manifestations
presence known risk factors raises possibility event atherosclerotic etiology
atherosclerotic strokes preceded tias
presence carotid bruit associated increased risk atherosclerotic stroke although necessarily distribution vessel bruit heard
diagnosis embolic stroke best made presence one cardiac conditions associated systemic embolization
patients ischemic tia stroke questioned examined evidence atrial arrhythmias recent myocardial infarction valvular disease cardiomyopathy
presence strokes different cerebral circulations evidence systemic embolization strongly suggests embolic stroke
although studies suggested embolic strokes lightninglike onset preceded tias often associated seizures onset features always reliable
although embolic strokes occur middle old age sudden onset ischemic stroke person age atherosclerotic risk factors suggests embolic event
lacunar events almost always occur patients hypertension
maximum deficit may present immediately may occur stuttering slowly progressive fashion
clinical differentiation atypical lacunar syndrome atherosclerotic syndromes often difficult classic lacunar syndromes especially pure motor hemiparesis recognized unwarranted invasive diagnostic procedures may avoided
treatment lacunar strokes consists treatment underlying hypertension
since lacunar strokes involve deep structures basal ganglia internal capsule brainstem patients lacunar stroke aphasia sensory neglect visual field loss deficits caused cortical dysfunction
small lacunar infarctions deep structures may seen ct scan mri may multiple
depending location lacunar infarctions asymptomatic
rare causes stroke considered especially younger individuals seeking evidence collagen diseases hematologic diseases sickle cell disease coagulopathies history recent long bone fracture fat emboli syndrome
main goal treatment prevent events treating underlying cause
atherosclerotic risk factors especially hypertension reduced eliminated
treatment stroke tia due atherosclerotic disease remains controversial
evidence beneficial effect aspirin agent
new antiplatelet drugs developed may effective
anticoagulation coumadin conclusive value atherosclerotic tia stroke although treatment choice embolic strokes tias
role carotid endarterectomy management carotid distribution tias long debated
patient ulcerated plaque internal carotid stenosis greater vascular distribution symptoms many clinicians would suggest surgery
factors considered including patient age presence concurrent medical illness risk operative morbidity mortality one institution
many proposed investigational medical surgical therapies ischemic tia stroke await documentation efficacy
addition risk stroke history ischemic cerebrovascular events clearly increases patient risk coronary disease becomes four times persons age
year mortality following stroke death largely cardiac causes
statistics must borne mind considering efficacy therapy ischemic stroke
also individual patients questioned carefully history symptoms coronary artery disease
differentiating ischemic stroke intracranial hemorrhage usually easy latter often much catastrophic precipitous onset severe headache nausea vomiting clouding consciousness
hemorrhages etiologies tend occur younger patients afflicted ischemic stroke
although often said ischemic strokes occur rest sleep whereas hemorrhages occur straining exertion always reliable rule
although headaches common hemorrhage also occur ischemic stroke every patient hemorrhage headache
vomiting within minutes onset highly suggestive hemorrhage
small intracerebral hematomas may indistinguishable ischemic stroke
differentiation readily made ct scan become almost routine evaluation patients stroke mandatory anticoagulation contemplated
intracerebral hematomas due hypertension predilection putamen thalamus pons cerebellum occur cerebral white matter
typically patient middle aged elderly hypertensive sudden headache focal deficit diagnosis confirmed ct scan
cerebellar hematomas true emergencies cause nausea ataxia nystagmus gaze palsies decreased consciousness
striking feature inability walk stand
immediate surgical evacuation usually required prevent brainstem compression cerebellar tonsillar herniation obstructive hydrocephalus
subarachnoid hemorrhage due ruptured saccular aneurysm must always suspected person sudden onset severe occipital headache especially associated confusion altered responsiveness stiff neck
patient provide history often dramatically describes pain worst headache life
headache may spread neck intrascapular area even low back
many patients exhibit irritability restlessness disturbed autonomic functions
although usually focal symptoms signs aneurysms example middle cerebral artery may rupture brain parenchyma confused hematomas due hypertension arteriovenous malformations
circumstances selective cerebral arteriography identify cause
clinical situation suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage ct scan head indicated
although blood seen subarachnoid spaces basal cisterns patients small hemorrhages older hemorrhages blood absorbed may missed ct scan requiring lumbar puncture
subarachnoid hemorrhage present complete selective cerebral arteriography demonstrate saccular aneurysm mandatory since surgical clipping undertaken prevent rebleeding
management aneurysms complex may also require treatment vasospasm results delayed superimposed ischemia communicating hydrocephalus
long term neurologic deficits due cerebrovascular disease important assess patient ability functional living
quality life many patients improved considerably participation comprehensive rehabilitation program
