headache consists pain discomfort arising pain sensitive structures head
include extracranial structures skin muscles blood vessels head neck mucosa sinuses dental structures intracranial structures including regions large arteries near circle willis great intracranial venous sinuses parts dura dural arteries cranial nerves
cranium brain parenchyma ependymal lining ventricles choroid plexus pain insensitive table
headache one common symptoms reported clinicians often causes great amount concern patients
vast majority headaches result benign conditions symptom represent early manifestation potentially serious disorder necessitates thorough evaluation
systematic history directed elucidate etiologic factors producing pain clinician valuable diagnostic tool often provides specific diagnosis
headaches classified three general groups based mechanisms pain produced table
pain vascular headache produced dilatation cerebral arteries
myogenic headache also referred tension muscle contraction headache results persistent contraction muscles head neck
traction headache caused organic diseases involving structures head
following historical topics addressed classify headache one three groups
type pain
many patients suffer one type headache
may result different etiologic factors may represent change character chronic headache disorder
temporal profile pain
acute onset headaches severe intensity occurring patient without previous history similar headaches may suggest organic etiology
timing onset association sleep hormonal cycles may helpful diagnosis
characteristics pain
location duration quality pain carefully evaluated
location may diffuse either unilateral bilateral localized specific structures head neck
vascular headaches produce throbbing pain constant pain results myogenic traction headaches
intensity pain reliable indicator seriousness underlying conditions causing headache
prodromes
neurologic symptoms may precede classic migraine headache
visual symptoms scintillations scotoma hemianopsia common symptoms hemiplegia ophthalmoplegia occur rarely
patients common migraine may report vague premonitory symptoms malaise psychic disturbances
precipitating factors
association headache environmental factors may helpful diagnosis
foods alcohol containing tyramine sodium nitrates may precipitate vascular headaches
patients report association menstruation
medications including nitrates vasodilators indomethacin oral contraceptives aggravate induce headache
occupational factors produce mechanical influences aggravate headache
history frequent neck movements exposure bright lights long periods work video terminals may helpful
associated symptoms
headache associated progressive neurologic deficits seizures indicate intracranial lesion
meningeal signs occurring acute violent headache suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage
migraine commonly sick headache associated nausea anorexia photophobia sonophobia
autonomic symptoms lacrimation nasal congestion facial flushing horner syndrome accompany cluster headaches
medical history
headache onset head trauma may suggest subdural hematoma
previous history malignancy systemic disease may suggest etiology headache
family history investigated migraine commonly familial
prior investigations patient headache including attempted therapeutic interventions carefully evaluated
headache produced direct irritation traction pain sensitive intracranial extracranial structures
inflammatory conditions meningitis produce pain direct irritation structures
mass lesions including tumors abscesses cause pain producing traction structures commonly dural vessels arteries circle willis
factors increase pressure produced lesions increase intensity pain
headache produced mechanism worsened increase central venous pressure caused valsalva maneuver
patient often note severe headache awakening lessens somewhat upright position maintained period time due slight increase brain edema induced periods recumbency
pathophysiology migraine extensively studied disorder believed result neurogenic mechanisms
classic migraine evidence suggests initial phase intracerebral vasoconstriction leads focal ischemia resulting prodromal symptoms followed phase extracerebral vasodilatation producing headache
changes metabolism several vasoactive amines occur association migraine may play critical role inducing vascular changes
plasma serotonin levels increase prodrome decrease headache
concomitant increase platelet aggregation leading serotonin release occurs prodrome followed fall platelet aggregation headache
levels substances change migraine may important pathogenesis e g polypeptides bradykinin prostaglandins endorphins
local changes vessels scalp occur headache phase may role pain production
sterile inflammatory reaction observed arteries vessels display altered reactivity vasoactive amines
detailed history fundamental importance evaluation patient headache accompanied thorough physical examination
investigations directed classification patient symptoms etiologic categories vascular myogenic traction headaches table
migraine cluster headache toxic vascular headache pain produced dilation extracerebral arteries
patients migraine suffer recurrent attacks headaches vary widely intensity frequency duration
headache commonly throbbing unilateral onset may vary side side
often associated anorexia nausea vomiting
migraine common females usually begins childhood adolescence
disorder often familial
duration pain variable usually hours days
patients note association headache physiologic environmental factors
minority patients migraine experience conspicuous transient neurologic symptoms preceding accompanying headache
termed classic migraine headaches
symptoms result vascular ischemia localized arterial distributions usually visual symptoms ophthalmoplegia hemiplegia occur termed complicated migraine
rarely cerebral ischemia migraine sufficient magnitude produce infarction
incidence stroke increased migraine population
patients common migraine experience conspicuous prodromal symptoms may report vague autonomic psychic symptoms
common migraine bilateral
patients cluster headache experience unilateral usually periorbital intense severe pain often described burning boring
pain lasts minutes hours often waking patient sleep
occurs clusters weeks months followed variable periods remission
cluster associated unilateral autonomic symptoms facial flushing conjunctival injection lacrimation rhinorrhea less commonly horner syndrome
patients usually males fourth fifth decade disorder strongly associated smoking history
toxic vascular headache result many physiologic environmental factors produce vasodilation
fever common
drugs including nitrates vasodilators indomethacin oral progestational agents cause type headache withdrawal pharmacologic agents ergots caffeine amphetamines phenothiazines alcohol
hypoxia either result pulmonary disease altitude lead headache
myogenic muscle contraction headache pain produced contraction muscles head neck
patients myogenic headache constant pain located region head neck often occipital area
pain may reported descriptive terms like hatband like vise
myogenic headache extremely variable frequency intensity duration
patients report pain persists months years despite trials multiple medications
myogenic headaches often occur reaction stress somatic manifestation chemically depressed patients also occur patients cervical arthritis following migraine attacks
variety organic diseases head cause traction headache
headaches result intracranial mass lesions metastatic tumors abscess hematoma
pain overlies location mass lesion half patients referred remainder
masses tentorium frequently produce pain vertex frontal region
masses tentorium produce occipital pain cervical muscle spasm may present
pain related cerebellopontine angle lesion often felt behind ear
presence papilledema raised intracranial pressure localization headache little value
mass lesions always considered patient headache papilledema focal neurologic signs
headache result intracranial tumors often becomes intense valsalva maneuvers coughing urinating straining stool
headaches often severe morning awakening decrease day intracranial pressure decreases maintenance upright posture
contrasts myogenic headaches often present morning increase severity day progresses
conditions cause inflammation meninges result headache associated stiff neck signs meningeal irritation
headache occurring stiff neck fever always first suggest possibility bacterial meningitis
agents produce meningeal inflammation include blood viruses fungi metastatic tumor
lumbar puncture diagnostic performed meningeal signs present patient headache
diseases ocular aural nasal sinusal dental structures produce headache
headaches resulting lesions structures identified specific symptoms referable structures localization pain
evaluation patient headaches always include thorough eent examination
giant cell arteritis temporal arteritis polyarteritis nodosa less commonly arteritis resulting connective tissue diseases produce headache
headache temporal arteritis throbbing intense persistent often associated burning component
patients may note pain mastication
ocular complaints may presenting symptoms
temporal arteritis major preventable cause loss vision elderly
sedimentation rate elevated conditions
patients transient ischemic attacks tias stroke experience headache result cerebral ischemia
basilar artery insufficiency produces occipital headache whereas carotid artery insufficiency produces pain anteriorly
patients trigeminal neuralgia tic douloureux experience repetitive intense shooting pains brief duration distribution one branches trigeminal nerve
pain associated trigger areas increased sensitivity
set attack stimulated
cranial neuralgias usually occur middle aged elderly patients
rarely glossopharyngeal nerve involved producing pain similar trigeminal neuralgia localized pharynx tonsillar fossa often initiated swallowing
dysfunction temporomandibular joint produce pain localized joint referred jaw neck along distribution temporalis muscle
pain may associated crepitance joint limitation jaw opening becomes severe chewing talking
general rule acute onset severe headaches associated meningeal signs headaches associated progressive neurologic deficits worrisome neuropathologic lesion
demand prompt evaluation
many patients headache fit clearly categories described
reassurance accompanied nonnarcotic analgesics follow care needed often appropriate management
