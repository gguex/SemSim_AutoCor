intermittent neurologic symptoms comprise group complaints may associated dysfunction many organ systems including central nervous system cardiovascular system vestibular apparatus
intermittent metabolic disturbances psychiatric problems may also result neurologic symptoms
despite diverse etiologies conditions discussed share following features intermittent recurrent usually brief lasting minutes hours patient usually asymptomatic attacks symptoms usually stereotyped individual patient
although intermittent neurologic symptoms often benign prognosis may manifestation serious condition
multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis certain neurologic illnesses may intermittent symptoms
patients conditions chronic course intermittent symptoms superimposed however discussed
many conditions resulting episodic neurologic symptoms discussed chapters chapter intended general approach patient symptoms
special problems include migrainous events versus partial seizures versus transient ischemic attacks tias syncope versus seizures evaluation dizziness evaluation ill defined symptoms
evaluating patient intermittent neurologic symptoms reassuring careful approach problem usually results definite diagnosis least reasonable hypotheses evaluated
useful remember clinical axiom common things common seizures syncope tias labyrinthine disorders hyperventilation seen frequently everyday practice
common clinical situation patient present medical care symptom
occasionally intermittent neurologic symptoms discovered incidentally review systems patient presenting unrelated problem
points mind certain investigational strategies helpful
first important try classify patient major symptom one categories table since immediately narrows diagnostic possibilities
accomplished listening carefully patient chief complaint
important things determine whether patient focal neurologic symptoms alteration consciousness
history critical importance examination events often normal
always best listen attentively patient tell story words rather ask specific questions early
invaluable diagnostic clues usually identified careful listener
patient encouraged start beginning relate first symptom others temporal sequence
information onset important volunteered sought direct questioning
helpful ask precipitating situations activities questions way tell spell occur
get warnings
way bring spell
obvious value questions detect focal onset aura seizures questions may also provide information stimulus precipitated seizures exercise induced syncope vasovagal syncope cataplectic attacks caused surprise emotion
patient asked long takes symptoms reach maximum intensity long entire event lasts
helpful ask whether patient ever experienced symptoms past
symptoms may recur intermittently many years including caused migraine many kinds seizures vasovagal syncope
recent onset symptoms may add sense clinical urgency patients syncope cardiac origin transient ischemic attacks
change character frequency attacks suggests progressive lesion cerebral neoplasm causing changing seizure disorder
associated symptoms may critically important may require questions notice anything else
feel sick way
example patient ménière disease may notice ear fullness tinnitus hearing loss associated vertigo patient migrainous neurologic deficit may notice headache nausea deficit improves
details associated symptoms sought order noticed
question examiner mind whether focal neurologic symptoms occurred review neurologic symptoms undertaken
patient quizzed whether event accompanied visual disturbance numbness weakness clumsiness speech disturbance
symptoms occurred determined spread areas rate spread
patient questioned postictal period unresponsiveness confusion
many cases diagnostically crucial information regarding spells must obtained friend family member
phase interview usually apparent major categories patient symptoms fit appropriate ask detailed questions differentiate among entities appropriate category
basic pathophysiology syncope epilepsy transient ischemic attacks migraine sleep disturbance discussed chapters book points emphasized
transient ischemic attacks probably result transient interruption blood flow specific portion brain
reasonable evidence tias due embolization platelet fibrin debris atherosclerotic plaques proximal portions large cerebral vessels especially carotid bifurcation
phenomenon sometimes actually visualized retinal arteries patients amaurosis fugax
bright cholesterol emboli platelet fibrin debris may seen bifurcations vessels branches ophthalmic artery turn arises internal carotid
time microemboli break pass distally
concept arterial laminar flow whereby blood flowing along arterial wall adjacent plaque always distributed area brain tissue thought explain stereotyped nature recurrent tias
important understand however many causes tias
example cardiac abnormalities many types may result cerebral emboli
cerebral vasculitis caused systemic lupus erythematosus giant cell arteritis granulomatous angiitis may interrupt blood flow
patients thrombocytosis erthyrocytosis leukocytosis may arterial capillary sludging transient ischemic symptoms
rarely patients multiple large vessel atherosclerotic occlusions may tenuous collateral blood flow certain areas brain transient ischemia caused drop systemic blood pressure
generally accepted seizures due abnormal spontaneous neuronal depolarization spread electrical activity many etiologies
primary generalized epilepsy abnormal discharges appear simultaneously head regions may originate centrally located generator diffuse projections perhaps thalamic reticular system
impaired consciousness may first manifestation motor signs occur bilateral
examples include primary tonic clonic seizures true petit mal seizures certain rarer types
age onset type seizure usually years
strong hereditary predisposition patients experience warning aura
acquired epilepsy may occur age may result varied insults birth hypoxia head trauma brain tumors cerebrovascular accidents
cases abnormal electrical activity begins locally often resulting focal neurologic symptoms
partial seizures may spread become secondarily generalized resulting tonic clonic seizure
focal seizure always implies focal brain dysfunction focus attention questions diagnostic tests designed find cause
older patient onset seizures likely clear etiology found
patients age many patients onset seizures cerebral neoplasm
always remembered many toxic metabolic causes seizures including acute hypoxia hypoglycemia hyperosmolar states hypo hypernatremia hypocalcemia uremia drug alcohol withdrawal
history examination lab studies directed uncovering etiologies patients first seizure
migraine may defined paroxysmal disturbance cephalic neurovascular function presenting episodic headaches may associated autonomic visual neurologic symptoms variable prominence
pathophysiology migraine still well understood
widely held belief neurologic visual events caused cerebral vasoconstriction subsequent headache result vasodilation certainly simplistic
clear data support hypothesis migrainous neurologic events due vasoconstriction researchers believe cortical phenomenon unknown etiology
although cerebral blood flow decreased migrainous neurologic dysfunction unclear primary event secondary event coupled neuronal dysfunction
syncope due global cerebral hypoperfusion
causes therefore almost exclusively cardiovascular examination laboratory studies focus causes hypotension decreased cardiac output especially bradyarrhythmias tachyarrhythmias
neurologic cause found fewer patients syncope usually unusual unwitnessed seizure
multiple high grade vascular stenoses transient increased intracranial pressure rare causes syncope
syncope attributed cerebrovascular disease unless accompanied focal neurologic symptoms
often clear etiology syncope found case benign course usually seen
symptoms seen narcolepsy syndrome due disordered sleep cycles causing inappropriate involuntary sleep day
rapid eye movement rem sleep normally occurs orderly progression sleep progressively deeper stages process takes hours
persons narcolepsy often progress directly rem sleep concomitant dreaming loss muscle tone
thought explain phenomena sleep paralysis hypnagogic hallucinations
loss muscle tone cataplectic attacks may also rem related event
patients sleep apnea may airway obstruction oropharynx loss central regulation respiration
chronically sleep deprived since invariably develop apnea reach deeper sleep stages resulting multiple brief nighttime arousals patient recall
consequently patient involuntary episodes daytime sleep
vertigo results disturbance normal balance left right vestibular systems respective brainstem connections
acute loss function overactivity one vestibular organ results vertigo
horizonal nystagmus frequent clinical accompaniment due extensive connections vestibular nuclei eye movement systems
patients vertigo central basis almost invariably brainstem symptoms findings due close proximity vestibular nuclei brainstem nuclei well ascending descending sensory motor tracts
brief episodes global cerebral hypoperfusion may result presyncope manifested lightheadedness symptoms
patients chronic ill defined dizziness considered possible psychiatric causes provided ataxia posterior column dysfunction drug medication side effects excluded
new data suggest panic attacks may result dysfunction central autonomic regulation may familial predisposition
since lactate bicarbonate infusions sometimes reproduce symptoms susceptible persons also possible reduction free ionized calcium causes symptoms
findings opened new possibilities research treatment
causes conversion reactions best explained psychodynamic basis
patients episodic neurologic symptoms may present major diagnostic challenge
sometimes symptoms caused underlying medical neurologic conditions require immediate treatment occasions episodic symptoms nonspecific events manifestation psychiatric disturbance
wide range different illnesses producing similar symptoms surprising conscientious clinician sometimes baffled frustrated
problem compounded fact many patients normal physical examinations
times may difficult decide initiating lengthy expensive diagnostic evaluation merely reassuring patient providing careful clinical follow
even exhaustive diagnostic evaluations undertaken etiology may found
observation preferable empirical treatment
common causes episodic focal neurologic dysfunction transient ischemic attacks tias migrainous phenomena partial seizures
entities certain identifying characteristics table circumstances diagnostic problems may occur
tias negative neurologic events characterized loss function whereas partial seizures positive excitatory phenomena
migrainous events often positive flickering lights involve visual phenomena negative weakness numbness neurologic symptoms occur
transient ischemic attacks usually present diagnostic problem except confusion migraine symptoms vague nonspecific
safest define tias focal neurologic deficit clearly localized specific cerebral vascular distribution
tias usually begin suddenly reach maximum deficit quickly precipitating aggravating factors
although tias defined lasting less hours less minutes duration
tias occur older individuals atherosclerotic risk factors especially hypertension
symptoms carotid tias include unilateral weakness sensory disturbance aphasia unilateral neglect amaurosis fugax fleeting blindness one eye
vertebrobasilar symptoms include vertigo diplopia dysarthria homonymous hemianopsia total cortical blindness ataxia shifting bilateral weakness numbness
patients tias eventually suffer completed stroke greatest risk first weeks
patients tias occurring rapid succession crescendo tias especially risk
migraine poses special problem diagnosis episodic symptoms manifestations protean
characteristic headache part attack diagnosis simple
however headache may inconspicuous absent
clinically important understand migrainous neurologic events usually begin insidiously spread gradually minutes whereas tias focal seizures much precipitous onset
common migrainous events headache visual especially scintillating scotomas
patient may describe flickering lights gradually spread across visual field often taking form jagged irregular line fortification phenomena
visual events photomas cloudlike scotomas homonymous hemianopsia may occur
occasionally patients migraine may experience spreading numbness weakness aphasia even brainstem symptoms
headache usually begins minutes symptoms subside
although onset usually middle age migraine change time terms frequency manifestations
postulated older patients appear tias may actually symptoms due migraine
diagnosis late life migraine accompaniment made symptoms exhibit typical slow migraine build identifiable cause
patient closely questioned past history intermittent throbbing headaches family history headache
many kinds partial seizures pattern usually stereotyped individual patient
simple partial seizures consist isolated motor sensory visual symptoms usually occur paroxysmally without warning build intensity seconds either disappear progress secondary generalization seizure discharge resulting major motor seizure
therefore important ask convulsions episodes loss consciousness ever follow focal neurologic symptom
examples symptoms seen focal seizures include jerking one side face one arm one leg may rapidly spread areas
focal sensory seizures may also occur spread similar fashion
visual seizures may consist simple geometric shapes focus occipital region complex visual phenomena scene vision focus temporal lobe
times alteration perception visual stimuli macropsia items appear magnified micropsia items appear small
examples partial seizures involving temporal lobe include unusual odors uncinate hallucinations noises psychic phenomena may simple emotion fear recurrent thought complex déjà vu
symptoms easily confused psychiatric conditions
intensity events stereotyped paroxysmal nature helpful identifying events partial seizures
complex partial seizures psychomotor seizures common form partial seizures often begin one temporal lobe phenomena described progressing clouding consciousness purposeless automatic motor activity face limbs
since partial seizures usually acquired suggest underlying focal brain lesion important question patient history head injury central nervous system infection stroke progressive neurologic symptoms suggestive cerebral neoplasm
intermittent loss consciousness immediately suggests syncope generalized seizures table
best way distinguish etiologies observe spell
since seldom possible physician must often rely information family friends
patient history event also important may incomplete
exceptions true petit mal childhood motor activity prominent seizures associated loss consciousness
tonic clonic seizures especially witnessed usually easily diagnosed
major motor seizures patients incontinent bite tongue cheek suffer injuries
patients syncope limp associated motor movements although occasionally clonic jerks may noticed
rarely tonic clonic seizure occurs
preceding symptoms extremely important
patients partial seizures secondarily generalize may aura consisting specific neurologic symptom prior loss consciousness
patients primary generalized epilepsy warning however
syncopal attack many patients experience lightheadedness weakness blurred vision nausea
patient always questioned regarding precipitating factors
seizures usually paroxysmal occasionally precipitated photic stimulation strobe lights watching television hyperventilation sleep deprivation drug alcohol withdrawal
seizures occur falling asleep sleep awakening
syncope may associated similar identical precipitating factors episode
examples include assuming erect posture orthostatic hypotension increased vagal tone cough urination emotional event
associated palpitations chest pain dyspnea diaphoresis nausea sought
history bradyarrhythmias tachyarrhythmias ischemic heart disease syncope associated exertion raises suspicion syncope cardiovascular origin
almost patients major motor seizures unresponsive number minutes seizure followed period disorientation confusion may last hours
patients may complain muscle soreness tenderness
although patients syncope may complain feeling weak usually quickly aware surroundings brief loss consciousness lasting seconds minutes
although listening carefully story related patient witnesses usually differentiate syncope seizures times distinction difficult
situation patient may need diagnostic evaluation possibilities
electroencephalogram sometimes helpful frequently normal interictally patients known seizure disorders
clear diagnosis established patient followed carefully possible clues may later permit accurate classification
better underdiagnose epilepsy uncertain cases considering medical social consequences diagnosis carries
sleep disturbances uncommon cause episodic altered consciousness
patients narcolepsy sleep apnea irresistible daytime sleepiness often inopportune dangerous times
patients admit falling asleep conversation driving car occasionally even active
patients episodes microsleep may perform semipurposeful acts recall
automatisms result confusion partial complex seizures
narcolepsy usually begins age almost always associated cataplexy generalized focal loss muscle tone occurs strong emotion
patients asked ever collapsed suddenly frightened angry midst laughter
less common symptoms associated narcolepsy syndrome sleep paralysis transient total paralysis falling asleep awakening hypnagogic hallucinations realistic nightmares occur person falls asleep
although patients sleep apnea excessive daytime sleepiness lack components narcolepsy syndrome
sleeping partner frequently give history nighttime snoring restless sleep frequent episodes apnea sleep
polysomnography help confirm diagnosis difficult cases
patients episodic alteration loss consciousness also questioned prescription counter illicit drugs might causing symptoms
dizziness common often confusing complaint meaning different things different people
especially critical ascertain patient sensation movement since vertigo usually result labyrinthine disorder
associated symptoms tinnitus hearing loss also suggest peripheral labyrinthine problem
patients acute vertigo prefer lie still since minimal movement exacerbates discomfort
nausea vomiting ataxia often occur
among many causes recurrent peripheral vertigo ménière disease vestibular neuronitis benign positional vertigo
vertigo occasionally associated tias involving cerebellum brainstem
generally accepted convention however isolated vertigo considered due brainstem dysfunction unless brainstem symptoms signs present
cause nonspecific dizziness fuzzy headedness often difficult elucidate
anxious patients may feeling floating detachment lightheadedness described dizziness may associated chronic hyperventilation
onset usually gradual feeling often lasts long periods time
patients presyncope may complain lightheadedness sometimes progresses syncope
finally patients posterior column disturbance peripheral neuropathy may complain dizziness better characterized unsteadiness dizziness feet
patients conversion reactions hyperventilation syndrome panic attacks depression may complain complex neurologic symptoms
addition dizziness patients may complain intermittent sensory symptoms tingling numbness weakness memory loss
patients conversion symptoms usually identified dramatic sometimes bizarre nature intermittent symptoms
history often related surprising detachment unconcern called la belle indifference
patient usually insight psychiatric basis symptoms unusual nonphysiologic findings often present neurologic examination
many patients previous history conversion reactions patients briquet syndrome history multiple conversion reactions involving multiple organ systems time often history multiple surgical procedures well meaning surgeons
acute hyperventilation syndrome usually recognized anxiety acro oral paresthesias feeling able take deep enough breath severe form carpal pedal spasm
times symptoms reproduced asking patient hyperventilate several minutes
patients panic attacks identify uncomfortable situations precipitate spells
patients usually complain severe apprehension dizziness chest discomfort palpitations fear losing control
onset usually age course chronic fluctuating many patients also phobias
occasionally patients appear panic attacks actually paroxysmal tachycardia autonomic dysfunction associated pheochromocytoma hypoglycemia complex partial seizures
neurologic symptoms also occur depressed patients often constant episodic
nondescript symptoms tiredness weakness dizziness predominate
pseudoseizures episodes appear epileptic seizures psychiatric origin
often distinguished true seizures atypical motor activity lack postictal state associated secondary gain
occasionally combined eeg videotelemetry attack distinguish true seizures pseudoseizures patients
psychiatric events may episodic include temper tantrums psychogenic amnesia
questions directed patient general adaptation social functioning previous history psychiatric difficulties also helpful separating patients symptoms psychiatric etiology due causes
