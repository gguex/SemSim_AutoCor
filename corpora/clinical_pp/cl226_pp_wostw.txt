health care complex issue
cultural language barriers complicate situation
western medicine developed subculture history language codes conduct expectations methods technologies concerns science supports
science teaches us human populations governed biologic universals transcend cultural boundaries
methods language biologically based somatically focused health care created extraordinary gulf practitioners public serve
disparity biomedical categorization human disruptions disease patient personal social experience illness
dichotomy disease illness experience provoked extensive commentary
proposed inability deal illness major failing biomedicine
cross cultural circumstances often magnify discrepancy views held patients health care providers
inability recognize deal perspectives illness deviate biomedically trained practitioner paralyze attempts identifying problems developing plans solving
biomedicine must use approaches recognize account views values individual cultures determining nature patient problems also describing solutions
undertake task practitioner must prepared accommodate dictates biology well experience illness perceived patient family group
provider patient communication involves socialization diagnostic inquiry planning negotiation goal setting therapy education
verbal interchange progresses communicant evolving sense contribution information shared basic meaning content
cultural boundaries major source discrepant views reality
patient care factors distort development commonly shared information necessarily alter perceptions clinical reality
clinical realities formulated setting heavily influenced provider dominant relationship recipients health care
consider provider asked help diagnose counsel treat often certify patient sick socially approved fashion provider organizes discussion directing fashion optimally relevant patient complaints situation provider molds patient responses findings recognizable manageable patterns allows problem description via paradigms illness developed accepted within context biomedical practice provider determines portions material regarded significant decision often made unilaterally independent patient views provider describes diagnostic therapeutic actions taken
provider dominance may introduce extraordinary bias lead unilateral ethnocentric view wrong
provider views may biased personal background values social class
addition formal training instruction certification medical methodology creates sense correctness authority superiority doctor knows best
circumstances lead situation patient views overlooked excluded invalid concerns
faced potential discrepant views constitutes illness cross cultural interchanges provider must first recognize means dominant role
provider dominance serve impede rather improve communications
failure recognize issue block practitioner ability consider patient views role illness process
symptoms disruptive life events often stimulus problem solving activities

patients special knowledge views e g cultural construct cause necessary therapy language communication problem family community problems issues may need elevated level concern par problem congestive heart failure
cross cultural accommodation care process allows biomedical psychosocial popular definitions coexist within framework cultural systems
requires patient provider consider plans therapy directed problems arising points view
failure establish accommodation may lead failure health care process
diagnostic therapeutic processes different cultures evolved ancient borrowed traditions
healing tradition including biomedicine inherently ethnocentric
cross cultural settings necessary patients providers accommodate circumstances illness described context one system
general systems involve discovery evolution illness description wrong actions taken attempts resolution
patients may connect life process symptomatology way fit biologic definitions
addition special knowledge popular health beliefs may play prominent role patient concerns
individual experience traditional practices beliefs well ability articulate may vary
many cultures discourage revelation exposure personal family issues
unfortunately biomedical focus often precludes revelations remain unrevealed unspoken

hidden behind explanatory systems find variations communication language use different expectations regarding interpersonal interactions interpersonal responsibilities well different approaches problem solving
complexity cross cultural circumstances magnifies serious problem biomedicine currently dealing nonbiomedical issues

consider dichotomy biomedical traditional native american diagnostic techniques
diagnostic practices worldwide based broad spectrum folk beliefs historical traditions often magical religious practices
whether parallel diagnostic technique pulse reading traditional chinese doctor nooksak sgwdíli instrument hmong shaman trance message similar
expectations generated practices may lead puzzlement biomedical diagnostic practices andor attribution magical qualities diagnostic therapeutic procedures
extensive questioning onset course illness may puzzle whose culture prepare biomedical methods problem solving
faced uncertainty expect diagnostic therapeutic encounters patient may withhold personal views wrong histories nonbiomedical diagnostic therapeutic actions already undertaken
patients may reluctant discuss beliefs herbal therapies home remedies practices religious efforts healing
often fear practitioner disdain activities
information may withheld altered avoid labeling cope anxiety illness times comply provider wishes
although scant systematic evidence regarding patient behaviors different cross cultural settings available literature suggests patients report illnesses differently depending behavior language skills ethnic identity degree specialization biomedically trained practitioners encounter
biomedical diagnostic technique includes history physical examination laboratory investigation
contrast diagnostic traditions questioning touching patient routine
example navajo crystal gazers use quartz crystals see objects shot patient vietnam
traditional practitioners indochinese medicine allowed touch body female patients except take pulse
female figurine provided physician wise physician could diagnose physical complaints female patients based patient pointing area figurine corresponding symptoms

since expectations set traditions vary question arises non western traditional patient react biomedical diagnostic techniques settings
personal experiences background provider patient increasingly disparate participant diminished ability relate perception illness experience
result useful provider shift interview focus follows
family history traditional part medical inquiry crucial cross cultural settings
major source information simultaneously allows provider show interest become familiar patient background
expanded family history often reveals information concerns offered spontaneously
many traditional cultures tied extended family process ways surprise westerners
reason inquiry needs go beyond anyone ever
stage
useful discuss whereabouts current activities family members
look similar symptoms illness family establish dates possible causes events
example native american refugee families quite common discover multiple incidents loss injury illness
look problems events within family community patient ties illness experience
explore life events day day activities interpersonal relationships
irrespective character source current illness episode narratives regarding prior life experiences help uncover focus patient views explanations
explanations used patients dynamic change time
represent amalgamation patient life experiences knowledge training experience illness well therapeutic efforts advice
patient explanations beliefs based highly focused cultural constructs illness
kleinman et al
used direct questioning elicit patient explanatory models
direct questioning often revealing prompts clear description patients view illnesses
revelations often key problem solving illustrated case figure
times however direct inquiry unsatisfactory
many groups individuals discuss personal ethnocentric views interview technique altered
furthermore individuals feel direct questions think caused problem sign provider uncertain dont know caused problem im wrong place
issue pointed harwood noted ethnic groups expect physician ultimate experts diagnosis treatment
following techniques help obtain information circumstances patient seems reluctant provide explanations historical data
use indirect approach externalize questions referencing problems others
traditional patients unwilling answer questions regarding feelings fears directly often provide illustrations concerns discussing illness others
acknowledge traditional beliefs illustrate
reference folk terms conversation discuss others said similar circumstances
example
change direct questions narrative statements examples given
information exchanged fashion gives patients families broadened sense practitioner focus permits discussion issues often left undisclosed avoids direct inquiry
inquire special terminology may apply problem called language
patient doesnt know ask grandmother elder would say difficulty
indirect approach sidesteps unwillingness traditional patients discuss problems openly directly appeals family knowledge beliefs
inquire dreams difficulties sleep
discussion sleep dreaming patterns often leads revelation key information regarding illness impact nature patient concerns
dreams increased significance settings magical religious beliefs played role healing problem solving
often critical markers assessment mental status
wording questions vary characteristics patient problem setting suggest following set questions elicit patient explanatory model
patients often hesitate disclose models doctors
clinicians need persistent order show patients ideas genuine interest importance clinical management
think caused problem
think started
think sickness

severe sickness
short long course
kind treatment think receive
important results hope receive treatment
chief problems sickness caused

kleinman p
patient personal vocabulary include terms like depression allergy cholecystitis even gallbladder disease words avoided
response times speech patterns vary
native americans often report anglos go fast take sufficient time conversation

building trust major issue
individuals small groups rural backgrounds accustomed dealing family kinship networks
help sought personal contacts generally comes individuals known family community
health care institutions often represent loss personal choice sense patient know providers vice versa
breaking barrier essential component provider patient interactions often involves breaking pattern neutrality distance noninvolvement physicians encouraged use
altered interviewing methods presented aimed encouraging patient discuss special life events issues beliefs

decisions wrong cross cultural settings call broadening scope possible problem descriptions
practitioner must reset goals problem description classic diagnostic therapeutic end point toward balanced management biological psychosocial issues including issues based non biomedical traditions
remember disparities communication style discrepant expectations may critical care process establishing correct diagnosis
dealing discrepancies problem description necessity
one begin describing problems parallel
illustrated case figure
two ethnocentric views wrong recognized accounted
case illustrates situation biomedical disease parallel totally discrepant explanation within alternative ethnomedical system
determined discrepant views exist clinical setting problems must dealt context one another
one faced dilemma ways descriptions valid
biomedically trained practitioner deal constructs illness disease fall outside realm biomedical culture
number points raised example
although biomedical problem may parallel discrepant description traditional popular system traditional diagnoses therapies often match biomedical diagnoses one one basis
tendency biomedically trained practitioners look biologic equivalents folk theories confounded fact folk definitions match biologic definitions
popular systems may describe problems culture specific
remember biomedical problems culture specific viewed outsider perspective biomedical practice culture specific loaded values western society
many traditional systems separate religion healing
results etiologic conclusions interpersonal spiritual moral overtones lack relatively amoral quality biologic etiologies
example exists asian systems religion healing based ancestral process
ancestral systems illness causation family members living dead intricately interwoven
family problems dreams specific events may viewed etiologic
constructs patients present illness descriptive combine variety actions social relationships feelings symptoms
constructs often viewed significant patients may relatively acausal biologic perspective
addition often difficult integrate coherent explanations wrong dealt valid individual experience concerns attached illness disease
many feel acknowledgment nonbiomedical traditional view perpetuates notions supporting folk traditions
experience authors alternative views clinical reality may acted upon concurrently irrespective whether practitioner recognizes acknowledges supports denounces
situations practitioners deal patients hold traditional nonbiomedical beliefs necessary evaluate impact beliefs problem solving process appropriate encourage concurrent use nonbiomedical traditions
disparate problem description plays role public health well individual health care process throughout world
zola addressed problem public health pointed

examples similar problems western peoples arise care jehovah witnesses christian scientists
latter groups use religious traditions explain focus views regarding acceptable health care interventions around illness healing
number observations useful
first cross cultural negotiation always successful
either patient provider failed communicate taken true believer role refused accommodate alternative view
second accommodation reached either sides may bend important givens truths right order cope wrong
third times alternative therapies theories seem dangerous circumstances provider skill education negotiation manipulation across cultural boundaries tested
fourth acknowledging use coexisting explanations therapies illness necessary establish basis cross cultural understanding negotiation
planning care cross cultural settings disparate views risk perceived responsibilities individuals surrounding ill friend family member must taken account
individuals surrounding ill patient potential survivors illness traditional nonbiomedical systems often seem meet essential needs group
problem oriented method describes nine separate steps establishing carrying patient care plans
begin goals aims problem management
special attention focused setting goals therapy problem contributes patient sickness effectsdisabilities produced given problem use education therapeutic process
issues relate process negotiation accommodation necessary cross cultural care
basic goals implications therapy may widely divergent
consider following dichotomy
biomedicine assumes disease individual issue
wrong biomedical perspective invokes therapeutic response aimed individual
circumstances involve genetic infectious disease environmental problems threatening mental health behavior biomedicine intervene behalf group
extraordinarily different perspective seen traditional therapies often aimed group well individual
involving multiple individuals therapeutic process traditional therapies often neutralize perceived threats group posed individual illness
example thai treatment soul loss community family actively participate therapy praying restitution patient
strings representing lost soul attached patient arm symbolically attaching blessing reattaching soul
similarly nooksak spirit dancers may burn gifts ancestors either ward trouble treat illness family community member
burning carried group setting dancers members family community participate
common nooksak perception group well individual treated cleansed protected process
remarkable parallel nooksak system similar attempts placate dead via ancestral meals gifts asia
healing tied ancestral religious process individual illness disease woven family fabric ways make western focus individual extraordinarily difficult patients families understand

measures outcome vary
example navajo occasionally use shock rite determine patient response therapy
use based mythologic teachings involves placing patient toward end day ceremonial structure represents home snake
test carried two men dressed bear holy boy
patient fails respond properly fright medicine man may decide stop establish another diagnosis andor seek different correct ceremonial therapy
explanations based religious dogma often make judgments regarding outcome heavily dependent magical religious premises process
question remains chronic recurring conditions failure respond shall
biomedically trained practitioners prepared disparate views within family
families exposed multiple healing traditions variety choices within one system may disagree among
example grandson arapaho medicine man torn advice use native american church protestant church grandfather traditions dealing chronic medical problem
family members thought solution lay biomedically trained physicians traditional solutions unwarranted
family disputes illness often reflect preexisting current family dynamics struggles
come attention health care providers often garbed cloak culture
often useful sort issues may key negotiating solution
death loss dysfunction disability often bring blame guilt illness picture
many systems accept natural death defined biomedical process
individuals families seek cause within social fabric belief structure
individuals andor events may blamed
practitioners need take issues account dealing potential survivors
people need reassured done
therapists neutralize blame discussing cause death disability family together everyone receives messages including messages defuse blame
especially important settings monolingual family using one family members interpret
instances critical deal care issues trained interpreter family member
failure result skewing information exchanged places extraordinary burden family member acted interpreter
influence family decision making process underestimated
illness experienced acted upon around sick individual fashion alter course evaluation therapy
faced poor response biomedical inquiry therapy useful reexplore patient family perceptions

misconceptions symptoms likely happen lead serious disruptions care process
issues generally related illness experience often key problem resolution
patients families ascribe therapeutic success improvement nonbiomedical therapies useful listen nonjudgmentally

important take lack model chronic disease account cross cultural therapy
patients often hope quick response western therapy may unaware implications chronic disease management
explanation essential instances
failure set expectations therapeutic outcome may lead patient conclusion treatment work
death dysfunction call mechanisms blame guilt play
biomedical explanations traditional means used help around sick patient neutralize issues
problem orientation offers means adapting clinical methods biomedical practice cross cultural care study
step problem solving process parallel activities traditional family systems care
step discrepant expectations practices family function communication style highlight areas potential concern clinical problem solving
problem solving across cultural boundaries often involves seeking help members community sociologic anthropologic ethnographic literature anthropologists
addition patients become invaluable source information sick often reveal issues might otherwise never disclosed
physician speak strange often unintelligible dialect creates communication gap physician patient acknowledged neither
kimball pp
patients providers often speak different languages even using common tongue
meaning intent problematic
message complaint may stand spectrum unspoken issues
issues patients attach illness episodes far diffuse confines biologic dictates
issues experiential arising life process family events circumstances well special perceptions causes illness
attachments illness episodes may go unrecognized remain unspoken focus verbal exchanges regarding illness
health care provider views complicated use special language focused methodology
patient complaints interpreted match recognizable biomedical patterns disease processes
unfortunately biomedical focus operates exclude consideration diverse interpersonal psychologic social components patients attach illness
biomedical training develops special knowledge methodology meaning
time alters narrows focus
even language used special terms often require explanation
individuals often personal vocabularies include terminology used health care providers
personal vocabularies vary based language skills ethnicity intelligence education socialization
prior life experience may lead individual attach special meanings specific term circumstance
terms diabetes rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis may seem deceptively simple
careful analysis disclose represent complex set physiologic chemical structural facts fabrega
terms seem common providers often perceived understood fashion match originally intended meaning
biomedical term complex meaning meaning continues evolve historic origins may replaced biomedical research refines perception understanding
health care personnel discuss illness patients use biomedical terms
time often fail use explanation justification part therapeutic armamentarium
result patients often remain uninformed meaning either biomedical view practitioner wrong
medicine like subculture complex lexicon also jargon folk speech
institutional processes places often reduced initialser adl asap prnor brief terms chemotherapy work
terminology deals stresses health care settings
dying patients said going tubes irritating patients may described dumps gomers crocks
latter descriptions patients health care personnel represent rich albeit esoteric folklore flourishes providing much needed outlet doctors nurses almost continual round clock pressure george dundes
noted folklore attendant language less esoteric language biomedicine
people health beliefs activities interact secular sacred healing traditions produce rich terminology human disruptions
communication problems medicine two way street
example chinese american patient referring cold hot features illness may special notions meaning message
alternatively message hot cold may hidden comment question food thought play role illness
hot cold theories illness widespread vary group group may change time across geographic boundaries
interaction folk notions biomedicine demonstrated term hypertension
hypertensive patients may view illness related hyper andor tense stress
three terms related american idiom
juxtaposition common idioms common diagnostic term thus provided folk definition etiology
another term hypertension high blood pressure often leads concerns life pressures relationship diagnosis
high blood pressure becomes im much pressure
first glance high blood pressure appears foreshortened urban rural blacks term high blood
term actually reflects notion certain foods cause blood rise body cause blood volume go
close parallel biomedical term folk term results interesting interaction biomedicine subculture
patients use term may referencing either notionthat much blood high blood pressure
however may simultaneously reference special idea etiology treatment example certain foods lemon juice vinegar pickles olives cut blood bring snow
terminology cause confusion
example problems may arise
individual advised blood count low blood pressure high since folk nosology high blood low blood obviously mutually exclusive physician making diagnosis thought fool patient may return treatment
snow
rich special terminology used within black community offers interesting example folk terminology subculture table
providers familiar folk terminology may inappropriately assume attaching meanings patients intend
thus patient statement fell like statement ive taken cold meaning requires exploration
take cold alludes commonly held belief cold causative health problems
references widespread etiologic notion may used explain number illnesses
like report prior episode double pneumonia prior nervous breakdown terms may stand variety human experiences
beware
patients practitioners alike attach special meanings language meanings often unspoken
attach simple brief translations terms start
full elucidation meaning often requires broad based explanation patient intent beliefs circumstance
folk terminology special regard origin usage
usage varies circumstance usage idiosyncratic
elucidation allows practitioner understand individual idiom attempting treat complaints kimball
specialization fosters complex lexicon
biomedicine traditional health systems specialized right
terminology purposes may seem hard understand across cultural barriers
gulf across cultures increases terms may appear exotic
part artifact created lack familiarity
new terms one language generally appear context readily available associations whereas first exposure term another language lacks easy attachments familiar language
terms always somewhat context across language barriers
addition cultural theories regarding illness produce complex set behaviors entire supporting lexicon
constructs illness produce special terms meanings often hard understand without broad defining process
example hmong refugee hill tribe southeast asia rich terminology appears tie liver psychosocial disruptions table
hmong terms imply special set definitions human disruptions
like folk terms language e g susto embruhado mexican americans reflect portion entire historic tradition
hmong terminology richly illustrates problem patients providers cross cultural medicine
someone hmong background relate western health care provider reference liver trouble sort
westerner deal hmong views psychosocial disruptions
special meanings terms imply
interpreter handle situation
circumstance illustrated parallel problem vietnamese word hepatitis

hoang erickson

complexity meaning varies usage
example lakota sioux dialect term iyumih translates distortedtwisted face appears surface describe individuals stroke bell palsy

necessary defuse sense blame guilt felt family members providing l day day care target anger
direct discussion sioux beliefs regarding interactions dead undertaken
interpret iyumih abstraction impending loss stress grief frustration anger misses concrete sioux concern interference dead sioux experience ghosts spirits
clear evidence family views idiosyncratic
according buechel iyumih also used longer phrase wanai iyumih literally translates ghost distortedtwisted face
l husband also referenced term clarifying nature concern
reasons discussions held father included reference prayers practices differing plains indian peoples used protect living potentially malevolent influence dead
many concepts wrong sufficiently ethnocentric lack equivalents languages
cross cultural care replete terms ideas may seem close describe similar behavior physiologic state often different definition common usage
example navajo term iichaa moth sickness describes form mental illness
seldom referenced interpreters however implies etiology relates incest
generic term mental illness common navajo usage may relate epilepsy epileptiform attacks
example difficulty going common english term parallel language lacks clear equivalent
lack linguistic equivalency complicated fact biomedicine model many societies major segments biomedical lexicon may missing language target populations
problem illustrated attempt produce term allergy vietnamese english medical guide

dreams may predictive hallucinations source great interest intuition may attributed external source
use language leads certain level caution inquiry agreements interpersonal interactions
many traditional patients uncertain intense interest shown practitioners
positive interest may mistaken willingness ability act something
example comment might something means might
practitioner
often misinterpreted traditionals mean said going something theyll take care
miscommunication intent common enough english speakers
magnified cross cultural settings circumstances unfamiliar
assessment mental status becomes difficult
example non literate societies anxiety free acceptance willingness describe hallucinatory experiences
hallucination per se seldom disturbing content focus interest zola p
hallucinations like dreams may take concrete meanings
since neither likely played major role training life experience biomedically trained practitioners often missed keys illness pattern
year old inupiat eskimo huntertrapper minister unrelenting flank pain

clearly become convinced death imminent
putsch unpublished
dreams telling patient wrong going happenthings doctor didnt know
using dreams language thoughts concrete predictive fashion
thus formula thinkwishdream something cause formula magical thinking seemed playing role illness
revelation dreams induced multiple prior attempts assess mental state unsuccessful
key shift interviewing took disparate language use account
told interviewer knew man could hunt caribou dreaming
comment prompted dreaming stories patient eventually story dreams
subsequently reported long history events led illness involved traditional explanation entire process
discussions led loss need pain medication
previous assessments based direct inquiry feelings something eskimo individuals socialized keep
native american patients reluctant tell health care providers hallucination dream experience
risk labeling great concern dominant society would take talk evidence psychosis
surprise westerners also avoid discussing hallucinatory experience
rees study hallucinations widowhood found one exception cases welsh widowers widows never discussed hallucinatory experiences either health care providers ministers
talked friends
welsh experiences hallucinatory phenomena remain within framework acceptable folk expression interchange
simultaneously excluded formal interchange authority figures
clinical settings dreams often play role patient concerns true patients wide variety backgrounds written language
however rural patients nonliterate groups dreams may viewed predictive
individuals groups used dreams hunt diagnose predict future
clear dreams often key assessment mental status native americans
may also hold evaluating mental status health concerns otherwise somaticizing asian patients
cross cultural interpretation
