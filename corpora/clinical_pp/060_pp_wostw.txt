normal cranial nerve iii nerve function position eye follows elevation eye adbucted superior rectus muscle elevation eye adducted inferior oblique muscle depression eye abducted inferior rectus muscle adduction medial rectus muscle lid elevation levator muscle pupil constriction pupil sphincter muscle
abnormal conditions involving total paralysis present eye fourth sixth nerves intact pupil dilated unresponsive stimuli ptosis drooping eyelid
partial paralysis weakness failure functions listed normal
cranial nerve iv functions depress eye eye adducted stimulation superior oblique muscle
failure eye depress indication paralysis
attempt restore binocular vision patient often depresses chin tilts head opposite shoulder
cranial nerve vi abducts eye stimulation lateral rectus muscle
failure abduction indicates paralysis
dysfunction cranial nerves iii iv vi recognized identifying paralysis individual eye muscles innervated nerves
three methods commonly used identify paralysis individual eye muscles
method observe rotation eye fields action appropriate muscle
eye tested separately figure
occlude one eye ask patient fixate penlight small object
starting eye straight ahead position move fixation target slowly horizontally field action lateral medial rectus muscles
observe range motion globe
limbus reach outer inner canthus
eye adducted move target field action inferior oblique muscle field action superior oblique muscle
eye abducted move test object test superior rectus muscle test inferior rectus muscle
six diagnostic positions gaze
note vertically acting oblique muscles function eye adducted vertically acting rectus muscles eye abducted
method comparison rotation yoke muscles
yoke muscles pair muscles responsible moving eyes conjugate direction
example left medial rectus right lateral rectus yoke muscles
innervational impulses equally distributed
ask patient follow object light moved six diagnostic fields gaze
failure one eye follow fellow eye indicates paralysis appropriate muscle eye
observing light reflected pupil accurate watching whole globe
normal light reflection displaced slightly nasal center pupil
additional maneuver cover one eye watch corrective movement uncovered eye
example paralysis right lateral rectus suspected cover left eye ask patient follow light field action right lateral rectus right lateral gaze
left eye uncovered right eye covered left eye moves briskly outward fixate light
amplitude corrective movement greatest field action paretic muscle
procedure useful either eye covered usually enhanced using paralytic eye initial fixation
example impulses going right lateral rectus equal going left medial rectus
attempt move paralyzed right lateral rectus impulses increased eyes
medial rectus therefore causes left eye move farther right partially paralyzed right eye moved
known secondary deviation
method red lens diplopia test
test makes use diplopia test eye muscle weakness
red lens one eye enables clinician identify eye red image belongs
convention red lens placed front right eye red right
hence red image always belongs right eye
penlight red lens needed
place red lens front right eye
hold light cm front patient eyes
ask patient fixate light move light six diagnostic positions gaze
fixation gaze position ask patient sees one two images
patient diplopia see two lights one red one white
ask patient tell far apart images describe horizontal right left vertical relationships position gaze
record findings chart using solid circle represent red light
test interpreted follows red lens right eye
patient describes red image right white image paralysis right left lateral rectus muscle
patient describes red image left white image paralysis right left medial rectus muscle
image displaced farthest direction gaze belongs eye paralyzed muscle
test valuable interpreting horizontal diplopia
test understood considering relationship fovea visual field
image focused fovea occupies center visual field
thus eyes swing conjugately right order keep object interest moving right focused fovea
muscle one eye weak eye keep normal eye
normal eye keeps object focused fovea therefore center visual field
weak eye loses foveal fixation visual image object strikes retina peripheral fovea
produces two visual images diplopia
distance two images increases eyes move farther field action weak muscle since image normal eye continues focused fovea
visual image weak eye gets farther fovea
consider images perceived cortex
image focused fovea localized center visual field noted
image focused retina left fovea localized cortex right visual field due reversal image lens
image focused retina right fovea localized cortex left visual field
figures
demonstrate use test detect lateral medial rectus paralysis right superior oblique paralysis
summary findings examples red lens right eye
right lateral gaze red image right white image paralysis right lateral rectus
follows guidelines red image right white image paralysis right left lateral rectus muscle
right eye therefore right lateral rectus involved since red image farthest direction gaze
left lateral gaze red image left white image paralysis right medial rectus
since red image left one medial recti involved
right medial rectus culprit since red image farthest direction gaze
additional tests include
head tilt test fourth nerve paralysis
tilt head first one shoulder
observe amount vertical separation eyes diplopic images
greatest separation occurs head tilted shoulder side paralysis
position head
head position often gives clue paretic ocular muscle
head tilted shoulder chin seen superior oblique muscle paralysis opposite direction tilt
head turned away side lateral rectus paralysis
examining function superior oblique muscle presence total third nerve paralysis
third cranial nerve paralyzed eye adducted hence depression globe adduction field action superior oblique performed
one look secondary action superior oblique rotation globe
ask patient look direction would normally adduct paretic eye
observe conjunctival vessel nasally asking patient look
gaze eye seen rotate inward superior oblique functioning
oculomotor nerve arises paired group motor cells extending approximately mm length beneath central gray substance mesencephalon level superior colliculi
axons nuclei pass ventrally red nucleus exit midbrain interpeduncular fossa
passing forward subarachnoid space third nerve lies adjacent posterior communicating artery punctures posterior wall cavernous sinus lateral posterior clinoid
within cavernous sinus assumes superolateral position anteriorly bifurcates superior inferior division
superior division supplies superior rectus levator palpebrae superioris muscles
branches inferior oculomotor division provide innervation medial rectus inferior rectus inferior oblique muscles along parasympathetic axons pupillo constrictor muscle iris ciliary body
oculomotor nuclear complex studied extensively warwick
following points deserve special emphasis lid levators served single dorsal caudal midline nucleus motor cell pool superior rectus muscle sends fibers across opposite oculomotor nerve supply contralateral superior rectus muscle nucleus convergence consistently demonstrated primates including humans caudal aspect oculomotor complex trochlear nucleus whose axons turn dorsally cross anterior medullary velum innervate contralateral superior oblique
therefore nuclear pools superior rectus superior oblique muscles contralateral eye move
trochlear nerve exits midbrain dorsally crosses contralateral fourth nerve anterior medullary velum caudal inferior colliculi
fourth nerve cranial nerve exit brain dorsally

based warwick scheme third nerve nuclear complex following rules apply clinical diagnosis nuclear third nerve lesions
conditions represent nuclear lesions unilateral external ophthalmoplegia without pupil involvement associated normal contralateral superior rectus function unilateral internal ophthalmoplegia unilateral ptosis conditions may nuclear bilateral total third nerve palsy bilateral ptosis bilateral internal ophthalmoplegia bilateral medial rectus palsy isolated single muscle involvement except levator superior rectus muscles obligatory nuclear lesions unilateral third nerve palsy contralateral superior rectus palsy bilateral partial ptosis bilateral third nerve palsy without internal ophthalmoplegia associated spared levator function
axons subnucleus oculomotor complex pass anteriorly medial red nucleus cerebral peduncles
nerve fascicles nucleus anatomically separate within midbrain fascicular lesions frequently produce partial oculomotor dysfunction
ipsilateral red nucleus simultaneously involved tremor contralateral extremities benedikt syndrome
ventral lesions involvement corticospinal tract cause spastic hemiparesis contralateral third palsy weber syndrome
common causes midbrain fascicular third nerve palsies include stroke trauma rare occasions brain tumors
third nerve damage interpeduncular subarachnoid space generally causes total third nerve paralysis
complete ptosis complete inability rotate eye upward downward inward
ipsilateral pupil large unreactive light near stimulus paralysis accommodation
traumatic third nerve damage aneurysms posterior communicating artery common causes acute spontaneous complete unilateral oculomotor paralysis
patients cerebral aneurysms present intense headache stupor coma many awake lucid pain free
pain regardless severity distinguish clearly third nerve palsy caused cerebral aneurysm nonsurgical causes acute oculomotor palsy
pupillary response light remains reliable way differentiating conditions
therefore term pupillary sparing needs precise definition
true pupillary sparing limited clinical situation complete ptosis paralysis ocular elevation depression adduction normal pupillary size movement
normal near normal pupillary reactivity partial ptosis andor partial ophthalmoparesis constitute true pupillary sparing condition simply represents partial third nerve palsy partial pupillomotor dysfunction
patient presenting true pupil sparing third nerve palsy rarely harbors intracranial tumor aneurysm
patients author opinion followed clinically state consciousness normal
provided pupil retains normal size reactivity week observation patients need undergo ct cerebral angiography
hypertension diabetes types small vessel disease cause true pupil sparing oculomotor palsies
syndrome pain may prominent usually resolves within days ophthalmoplegia always resolves within months
clinicopathologic studies patients revealed swelling subarachnoid intercavernous portion third nerve hyalinized vessels supplying swollen segment nerve ischemic infarction nerve core
patients true pupil sparing third nerve palsies vascular self limiting conditions lesions cavernous sinus superior orbital fissure also cause normal pupillary movement
stated patients usually partial weakness oculomotor nerve structures
since oculomotor nerve bifurcates superior inferior divisions within cavernous sinus superior orbital fissure relative pupillary sparing may part reflect sparing inferior division also innervates medial inferior rectus inferior oblique muscles
may explained fact pupillomotor fibers process joining twig inferior oblique muscle may either assume independent course descend vulnerable superficial position subarachnoid portion nerve relatively protected position within substance nerve lateral inferior surface
cavernous sinus involvement third nerve differentiated proximal oculomotor lesions accompanying signs point involvement contiguous anatomic structures namely sixth fifth fourth sympathetic nerves
closed head trauma far common cause unilateral bilateral fourth nerve palsies
isolated fourth nerve weakness may also occur patients hypertension andor diabetes rare occasions may sign space occupying lesion within brainstem
tensilon test always performed patient isolated superior oblique palsy recent history head trauma documentation hypertension diabetes
causes sixth nerve palsy legion evaluation patients extensive expensive examiner first rule causes pseudo sixth nerve palsy
conditions also produce abduction failure include duane syndrome spasm near reflex myasthenia gravis thyroid ophthalmopathy
duane syndrome congenital usually unilateral abduction deficit often occurs females
attempt abduct affected eye concomitant widening ipsilateral palpebral fissure
ocular adduction accompanied narrowing palpebral fissure retraction globe
duane syndrome reportedly related congenital atresia absence ipsilateral sixth nerve denervated lateral rectus muscle reinnervated twig oculomotor nerve
spasm near reflex functional disorder eye movement
lateral gaze patient superimposes ocular convergence
instance patient gazes left right left eyes initially move full extent patient converges
point right eye remains adducted left eye floats medially simulating abduction failure
true diagnosis established observing pupil size act convergence also produces miosis
true abduction palsy pupil size remains constant
myasthenia present isolated eye muscle palsy thus mimics sixth nerve palsy
patient unexplained double vision especially fluctuating nature lie considered myasthenic suspect undergo tensilon testing
physician rely solely upon subjective improvement diplopia tensilon administration
objective measurement diplopia prisms cross cover test drug administration better suited purpose
restrictive eye movement caused pathologic changes extraocular muscles secondary entrapment dysthyroidism also cause abduction limitation
extraocular muscles dysthyroid ophthalmopathy usually enlarged firm rubbery owing interstitial edema endomysial fibrosis heavy infiltrate collagen mucopolysaccharides lymphocytes plasma cells
added bulk physically enlarges eye muscles tethers globe
results variable degrees primary position strabismus andor incomplete ocular ductions versions
severe involvement medial rectus muscle example fixes globe medial position
less extensive myopathy eyes may straight primary position move normally across horizontal plane small esotropia present lateral gaze
clinical situationsmimicking gross minimal abduction palsy respectivelywarrant force ductions tests
failure examiner move globe direction ocular paresis indicates inelasticity antagonist eye muscle weakness agonist eye muscle
restriction related fibrosis entrapment direct infiltration muscle commonly caused thyroid ophthalmopathy
diagnosis true sixth nerve palsy established various etiologies considered depending upon site culpable lesion
patients intra parenchymal sixth nerve disease usually show signs involvement contiguous anatomic structures
close proximity sixth nerve nucleus fascicles facial trigeminal nerves corticospinal tract median longitudinal fasciculus paramedian pontine reticular formation
combination clinical findings pointing involvement structures signals presence intrapontine lesion

nerve ascends clivus may involved intraforaminal extension nasopharyngeal carcinoma clivus chordoma neoplasms pre pontine basal cistern
addition basal forms meningitis sarcoidosis tuberculosis cryptococcus carcinomatosis frequently produce unilateral bilateral sixth nerve palsies early sign
entering cavernous sinus abducens nerve crosses medial aspect petrous bone
preantibiotic era severe unrelenting middle ear disease would frequently lead petrous osteomyelitis
children would present combination severe pain trigeminal distribution ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy gradenigo syndrome
lesions cavernous sinus produce polyneuropathic ophthalmoparesis
usually mixture sympathetic third fourth sixth fifth cranial nerve involvement
anterior cavernous sinus superior orbital fissure lesions mixed ophthalmoparesis generally show moderate severe proptosis
bilateral polyneuropathic extraocular muscle palsies may seen following situations guillain barré syndrome infiltrative brainstem tumors extension nasopharyngeal carcinoma along base skull carcinomatous meningitis basal meninges sarcoidosis clivus chordoma pituitary apoplexy extra extracellular extension pituitary tumor one cavernous sinuses sphenoid carcinoma cavernous sinus thrombosis many forms carotid cavernous fistulas
