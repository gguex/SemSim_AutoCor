hemoptysis expectoration blood blood tinged sputum lungs tracheobronchial tree
hemoptysis important symptom elicits fear patient physician
work symptom undertaken immediately unless problem mild recurrent case conservative approach may sometimes preferable
thorough history may help define site also cause bleeding
evaluating hemoptysis first step convince lower respiratory tract source bleeding
coughing important nonpulmonary sources bleeding usually associated hemoptysis
questions regarding epistaxis spitting blood without coughing help rule upper respiratory tract source bleeding replace thorough nose throat examination
physician must convinced bleeding gastrointestinal origin
history nausea vomiting heartburn abdominal pain may helpful occasionally differential diagnosis difficult requires either direct observation patient hemoptysis endoscopic evaluation upper gastrointestinal tract
physician quantify amount bleeding taken place specific possible e g teaspoon cupful
patients physicians usually overestimate amount bleeding nothing replace direct observation
approximate rate bleeding requires careful quantification
rapidity extent work depend large degree quantification importance aspect history overemphasized
note first episode hemoptysis whether chronic andor recurrent problem
quantity past bleeding extent previous evaluations quite helpful
despite fact repeated evaluations recurrent hemoptysis often advocated experts evaluations expensive unrewarding many patients
one next investigate thoroughly material produced
patient coughing bright red blood blood clots carcinoma lung tuberculosis pulmonary embolism blood streaked purulent sputum bronchitis bronchiectasis pneumonia blood tinged white frothy sputum congestive heart failure foul smelling bloody sputum anaerobic lung abscess
red sputum contains blood seen rare case serratia marcescens pneumonia red pigmentation glass sanders sputum discolored iron oxide ruptured hepatic amebic liver abscess anchovy paste sputum
rarely patient present pseudo hemoptysis created artificially various means
associated pulmonary symptoms chronic cough sputum production change cough shortness breath exertion chest pain especially pleuritic nature wheezing also important evaluation hemoptysis
relation symptoms onset hemoptysis quite helpful
example hemoptysis lung cancer tuberculosis usually late symptom preceded weight loss change cough fatigue chronic symptoms
points history must addressed include previous pulmonary infections recent blunt chest trauma seizures lower extremity pain swelling exposure agents cigarette smoke alcohol asbestos tuberculosis use medications e g anticoagulants finally systemic symptoms fever weight loss bleeding problems especially hematuria table
age patient also useful narrowing differential diagnosis
cystic fibrosis disease children young adults mitral stenosis bronchial adenomas goodpasture syndrome primary pulmonary hypertension occur middle aged carcinoma lung usually seen patients years age
depending underlying disease hemoptysis result several different pathologic mechanisms
remember lung contains two separate vascular systems pulmonary bronchial vessels
hemoptysis occur involvement either
infarction lung tissue hemoptysis occur numerous diseases
pulmonary emboli often present hemoptysis result ischemic pulmonary parenchymal necrosis
similar ischemic necrosis seen idiopathic vasculitides involving pulmonary vessels including wegener granulomatosis
infections causing blood vessel invasion infarction include primarily staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa aspergillus fumigatus phycomycetes
vascular engorgement erosion another mechanism hemoptysis
occurs within bronchial capillaries mucosa tracheobronchial tree result acute infection viral bacterial bronchitis chronic infection bronchiectasis toxic exposure cigarette smoke
shearing force coughing result bleeding
local hyperemia seen common bacterial pneumonias streptococcus pneumonia
vascular congestion followed red hepatization lung alveoli filled blood tinged fluid bacteria neutrophils fibrin added
results production rust colored purulent sputum classically seen pneumococcal pneumonia
similar situation found contusion lung exudation blood fluid alveoli
course purulent nature sputum absent situation
vascular engorgement dilated bronchial vessels along anastomoses pulmonary bronchial circulations occurs tuberculosis bronchiectasis lung abscesses cystic fibrosis
resulting erosion rupture pulmonary capillaries adjacent bronchial arteries leads hemoptysis massive
rupture rasmussen aneurysm dilated bronchial vessel wall tuberculous cavity relatively rare cause hemoptysis
necrosis pulmonary parenchyma seen chronic infections tuberculosis malignant tumors lung
latter also cause bleeding outgrowing blood supply resultant tumor necrosis well bronchial mucosal invasion also seen tuberculosis
large vessel invasion rarely result massive hemoptysis
disruption pulmonary capillaries seen either result increased intravascular pressure mitral stenosis left ventricular failure result disruption alveolocapillary basement membrane antibasement membrane antibody seen goodpasture syndrome
aspergillomas frequently associated hemoptysis
local friction moving fungus ball reactive capillary proliferation bronchiopulmonary anastomoses release proteolytic enzyme postulated role etiology bleeding
hemoptysis must always considered serious potentially lethal complication underlying process
aggressive approach taken evaluation hemoptysis cause determined approximately cases
table
outlines main causes hemoptysis
marked variation seen center center depending whether inpatients outpatients categorized whether tuberculosis prevalent whether one evaluating surgical medical patients
amount bleeding useful differential diagnosis hemoptysis
benign processes bronchitis pneumonia cause majority cases hemoptysis less common severity bleeding increases
massive hemoptysis commonly associated lung cancer bleeding diathesis e g leukemia chemotherapy anticoagulation cystic fibrosis tuberculosis
complete means exhaustive list causes given table
helps one formulate approach physical examination
young healthy woman chronic hemoptysis may well bronchial adenoma patient presenting dyspnea hemoptysis may mitral stenosis primary pulmonary hypertension mucocutaneous telangiectasis often seen osler weber rendu syndrome putrid sputum alcoholic seizure patient points toward lung abscess
streak hemoptysis chronic smoker often due bronchitis carcinoma lung must always ruled especially patient associated symptoms weight loss
chronic cough fever weight loss complicated hemoptysis seen tuberculosis bronchiectasis although latter often marked sputum production
systemic disease resulting hemoptysis points toward vasculitis goodpasture syndrome
therapy depends underlying process rate hemoptysis
amounts greater ml hours calls aggressive diagnostic approach
risk dying degree hemoptysis however rests primarily underlying disease
bronchitis bronchiectasis low mortality even amount bleeding whereas patients tuberculosis lung cancer lung abscesses higher risk
therapy controversial usually nonsurgical except small group patients resectable lesion chest roentgenogram respiratory hemodynamic failure
