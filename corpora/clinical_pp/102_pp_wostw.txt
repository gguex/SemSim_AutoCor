approximately million people united states gallstones
indeed cholecystectomies performed annually making common abdominal surgical procedure
every patient eventually undergoes cholecystectomy estimated two five patients right upper quadrant pain requires gallbladder imaging gallstones
four modalities currently available evaluation gallbladder oral cholecystogram ocg ultrasound ct mtc hida cholescintigraphy berk
ocg patient consumes g iapanoic acid telepaque iodinated agent absorbed small bowel conjugated liver excreted bile concentrated gallbladder
following day multiple radiographs gallbladder obtained
although ocg accuracy several major limitations
peak gallbladder opacification occurs within hours suitable patients present acute right upper quadrant pain
double dose examination required normal patients necessitating prolonged hospitalization return visit
ionizing radiation used patients develop diarrhea contrast tablets
also many factors unrelated gallbladder function malabsorption poor liver function biliary obstruction interfere examination
although ocg gold standard decades largely supplanted ultrasound imaging modality choice diagnosis disorders gallbladder biliary tract
advantages ultrasound include rapid diagnosis gallstones minutes vs

liver disease jaundice malabsorption pancreatitis pregnancy
sonographically gallstones produce echogenic foci within gallbladder show movement change position produce posterior acoustic shadow figure
shadow produced gallbladder absorbs sound beam converts heat
therefore sound available interrogate deeper structures thus shadow formed
three conditions must fulfilled make diagnosis gallstones
meticulously performed real time sonography detect calculi small mm sensitivity reported high laing et al
gallbladder identified fasting patients appears saccular anechoic structure region interlobar fissure liver laing et al
ideally patient fasting hours allow maximum filling distention gallbladder
patient course scanned time

gallbladder studied common hepatic duct visualized anterior portal vein
normal patient duct mm less
patient cholecystectomy common hepatic duct increase mm size patients remains mm smaller
gallbladder wall thickness also assessed normally less mm size
thickened variety conditions including acute chronic cholecystitis ascites total parenteral nutrition portal hypertension leukemia lymphoma
tiny stones biliary sludge comprising cholesterol crystals calcium bilirubinate granules produce fine echogenic pattern gallbladder without shadowing

echogenic material layers dependent portion gallbladder
calculus becomes impacted near neck gallbladder cystic duct patient experience biliary colic ultimately acute cholecystitis
currently controversy radiology preferred technique diagnosis acute cholecystitis
two modalities great value evaluating patients cholescintigraphy ultrasound figure
ultrasound demonstrate gallstones occasionally thickening gallbladder wall

also sonographic murphy sign gallbladder exquisitely tender transducer passed
absence sign especially useful tenderness arises adjacent structure right kidney gastric antrum
even lacking specific features suggest acute cholecystitis one need prove cystic duct obstructed justify cholecystectomy patient typical pain gallstones laing et al
hida gallbladder scan another excellent modality diagnosis cholecystitis

isotope fills gallbladder retrograde passage cystic duct enters duodenum via common duct
normally gallbladder duodenum filled radioisotope hour less
gallbladder visualized cystic duct patency assured likelihood acute cholecystitis small
modality several drawbacks however
first stones within gallbladder visualized
second failure visualize gallbladder suggestive acute cholecystitis prove diagnosis
gallbladder patients history alcoholism pancreatitis total parenteral nutrition fasting prolonged periods may fail opacify
additionally hida scan visualizes hepatobiliary system provide view surrounding structures
ultrasound affords visualization pancreas liver right kidney may simulate pain acute cholecystitis
important consider view fact one third patients symptoms typical acute cholecystitis disease

traditional radiographic techniques plain films barium studies image pancreas indirectly
indeed pancreas long considered hidden organ abdomen difficult examine clinically radiographically
development ct ultrasound opened new frontiers noninvasive detection pancreatic peripancreatic lesions allowing direct visualization pancreatic parencyma yankaskas et al
ercp useful diagnostic adjunct regard
pancreatitis common clinical entity associated considerable morbidity mortality
alcoholism common bile duct stones trauma drugs hyperlipidemia pancreas divisum may precipitate disease

acute self limited pancreatitis pancreatic imaging probably necessary
number complications pancreatitis must diagnosed optimal patient management
include pancreatic fluid collections pseudocysts phlegmon pancreatic abscess arteriovenous fistulas biliary obstruction hemorrhage
pancreatic imaging important clinical settings order determine whether pancreas source symptoms determine extent complications
acute pancreatitis regardless cause associated edema causes enlargement irregularity diffusely decreased echogenicity pancreas ultrasound
acute uncomplicated pancreatitis pancreas enlarged low density ct
choice ct ultrasound imaging acute pancreatitis dictated expertise examiner equipment available
many patients acute pancreatitis may ileus preclude thorough sonographic evaluation
ct additional ability image tail pancreas lesser sac various peritoneal compartments
important defining true extent fluid collections pseudocysts
ct also preferred imaging pancreatic abscesses uncommon complications disease
reasons ct best single imaging modality diagnosis pancreatitis complications williford et al
ultrasound however used follow size pseudocyst means employed evaluate gallbladder gallstones major cause pancreatitis united states
complications acute pancreatitis common detected early often treated without sequelae
primary role cross sectional imaging disorder
intrahepatic extrapancreatic fluid collections occur patients pancreatitis figure
although term pseudocyst implies presence wall containing structure fluid collections often uncontained poorly circumscribed
fluid collections rich proteolytic enzymes frequently found lesser sac may extend along retroperitoneal tissue planes direction
may also dissect mediastinum reach neck retroperitoneum far groin
wall pseudocyst initially formed whatever tissue structures first limit spread
pseudocyst matures evoked inflammatory reaction encapsulates contents pseudocyst granulation tissue ultimately fibrous wall
ultrasound pseudocysts typically round smooth cystic collections detected accuracy
ct pseudocysts may first soft tissue density might better termed phlegmon boggy edematous pancreas
maturation becomes lower density
ct preferred modality pseudocysts detect extrapancreatic locations hindered bowel gas
pseudocyst followed resolution demonstrated
pseudocysts dynamic lesions increase decrease size several days remain stable months
first weeks resolve spontaneously chronicity sets spontaneous resolution much less likely rate complications rises weeks
complications include infection intraperitoneal rupture erosion adjacent arteries gastrointestinal hemorrhage occlusion splenic vein
pancreatic abscess another common serious complication acute pancreatitis occurring patients hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis patients pancreatitis
untreated mortality reaches
ct preferred imaging modality diagnosis abscess

carcinoma pancreas remains elusive tumor exocrine pancreatic neoplasms present nonspecific symptoms
carcinoma pancreas fifth common cause cancer death united states
five year survival dismal cures rare tumor seldom diagnosed prior extensive local growth metastatic spread

two thirds carcinomas appear pancreatic head remainder occurring body tail
ct findings pancreatic carcinoma figure
include pancreatic mass low attenuation seen within mass celiac superior mesenteric artery encasement tumor dilation pancreatic duct biliary dilation hepatic metastases atrophy pancreatic tail
tumors body tail often larger head time initial evaluation asymptomatic longer period
mass defect contour abnormalities identified secondary signs tumor may helpful reaching diagnosis
small tumors head may produce contour defects yet cause dilation biliary tree pancreatic duct
absence calculi dilation often associated carcinoma pancreatic head
cases time diagnosis carcinoma made tumor unresectable
order eliminate need exploratory laparotomy tumor resectability must assessed tissue confirmation obtained
primary ct criteria unresectability hepatic regional lymph node metastases retroperitoneal extension tumor enveloping superior mesenteric artery splenic vein celiac artery inferior vena cava loss posterior fat planes separate pancreas retroperitoneal lymph nodes invasion contiguous organs
secondary signs include ascites splenomegaly due splenic vein occlusion mesenteric varices due obstruction superior mesenteric vein
ct directed fine needle aspiration biopsy effective means establishing histologic diagnosis carcinoma pancreas

prevailing medical opinion favors endoscopy initial diagnostic procedure patients massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding steer silen
endoscopist visualize superficial mucosal lesions esophagitis gastritis superficial duodenal gastric erosions well mallory weiss tears varices ulcers
endoscopy usually determine lesion responsible hemorrhage important consideration patients multiple lesions e patients cirrhosis portal hypertension
endoscopist affect therapy patients bleeding example sclerotherapy varices laser coagulation larson farnell
important realize majority patients endoscopic visualization bleeding source alter morbidity mortality length hospital stay transfusion requirements
although endoscopy excellent evaluation upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage role colonoscopy massive colonic hemorrhage limited
presence stool large amounts blood severely limit visualization colon
flexible sigmoidoscopy value identifying site hemorrhage rectum well documenting presence fresh blood originating level
barium gut interferes subsequent endoscopy angiography radionuclide procedures barium upper gi series used initial evaluation acute hemorrhage
double contrast barium studies useful endoscopy failed angiography attempted cessation bleeding medical therapy stops hemorrhage endoscopy contraindicated endoscopy negative angiography contemplated
barium enema limited role patients acute massive lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage bleeding diverticular disease vascular malformation
although double contrast barium enema superb detection carcinoma polyps rarely present massive hemorrhage
ischemic colitis usually due nonocclusive low flow states may present acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage
patient history clinical pattern suggest diagnosis barium enema examination may procedure choice
modern angiographic methods revolutionized diagnostic therapeutic approach acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage
arteriography used patients continue bleed despite conservative medical management steer silen
upper gastrointestinal tract arteriography used whenever bleeding rapid efficient endoscopy endoscopy inconclusive patient poor surgical candidate vigorously bleeding require therapeutic transcatheter hemostasis
virtually major causes hemorrhage identified specific etiology dictate whether intra arterial infusion vasopressin transcatheter embolization employed
bleeding site identified patients
transcatheter hemostatic method permit time vascular volume replacement patients hemostasis fails temporary
buys time get patient stable condition preparation surgery
arteriography procedure choice patients acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage bleeding colonic diverticula angiodysplasia
additionally arteriography useful diverticular hemorrhage vasopressin infusion selective embolization highly successful stopping hemorrhage
many patients surgery completely avoided
arteriography demonstrate small dilated clusters arteries veins characteristic angiodysplasia even patient actively bleeding
arteriography positive patient actively bleeding rate

hemorrhage slow intermittent stopped arteriography negative
advocate utilizing nuclear techniques document active bleeding starting angiogram invasive specific less sensitive examination
nuclear imaging techniques shown localize occult gastrointestinal bleeding sites whether active intermittent rates low
mlmin
major techniques depend upon recognition radioactivity bowel lumen indicate hemorrhage
one technique bolus injection mtc sulfur colloid radioisotope used liver spleen scan administered
since reticuloendothelial system rapidly extracts colloid blood extravasated colloid bleeding site imaged high contrast within minutes
low background activity time small amounts blood seen
useful determine patient actively bleeding agent almost completely removed vascular space minutes
bleeding must occur within minutes injection detected however
examination positive angiography performed excellent chance bleeding site found therapy effected
nuclear medicine study performed first sensitive save patient invasive procedure active bleeding detected
principal shortcoming procedure like contrast angiography patient must actively bleeding relatively short temporal transit radioisotope blood
also areas bleeding near liver spleen may missed
another technique developed patient red blood cells labeled mtc pertechnetate
red blood cells circulate normally serial images abdomen may reveal focal accumulation labeled cells gut lumen pattern fairly easy differentiate blood vessels
serial images obtained hour period
thus intermittent bleeding sites located geographic movement extravasated activity monitored periodically allowing precise anatomical localization bleeding site
labeled cells gut lumen resorbed bleeding occurs time radiopharmaceutical injection imaging may identified
bleeding starts stops course one day may thus detected
technique differs angiography mtc sulfur colloid scans active bleeding time injection need present detection
labeled red blood cell technique less sensitive requires bleeding rates near
mlmin similar angiography
sulfur colloid method superior active slow bleeders red blood cell method better intermittent bleeders
bleeding found angiogram performed vasopressin infusion embolization surgery contemplated
