third heart sound low frequency brief vibration occurring early diastole end rapid diastolic filling period right left ventricle figure
synonymous terms include ventricular gallop early diastolic gallop ventricular filling sound protodiastolic gallop
term gallop first used jean baptiste bouillaud describe cadence three heart sounds occurring rapid succession
best description third heart sound provided pierre carl potain pupil bouillaud stated
one distinguishes therein three sounds namely two normal sounds heart superadded sound
sound dull much normal sound
shock perceptible elevation hardly sound
one applies ear chest affected tactile sensation perhaps auditory one
addition two normal sounds bruit completes triple rhythm heart
thus produces rhythm three sounds unequally distinct occasionally unequally distant rhythm ear seizes extreme facility provided perceived distinctly
bruit de galop
third heart sound tests ausculatory skills examiner often difficult heart sound hear
caused several factors
sound usually low intensity easily obscured extraneous room sounds lung abdominal noise tightening chest wall muscles
sound radiate widely audible small area chest wall
usual frequency pitch sound near lowest level human ear detect
inexperienced ear unaccustomed listening sound low frequency
extraneous noisesradio television visitors hall noisesshould excluded room quiet possible
bed elevated comfortable level examiner
patient examined supine turned Â° left lateral position left arm extended upward away chest weight comfortably supported left hip lateral chest left arm figure
left lateral position critical importance ventricular gallop often heard patient turned side
apical impulse located careful palpation bell stethoscope placed lightly apex
examiner listens selectively third heart soundtuning early diastole low frequency sounds ignoring heart sounds murmurs
patient asked exhale suspend respiration temporarily order provide maximal silence listen
bell stethoscope glided around apical lower sternal area seeking left ventricular gallop
simultaneous palpation inspection apex useful however third heart sound rarely palpable visible audible
right ventricular third heart sound uncommon finding heard association right ventricular dysfunction variety causes
usually heard best listening along right left lower sternal edge epigastrium rarely jugular veins
inspiratory increase intensity identifies right ventricular gallop
diagnostic feature may absent however right ventricular distention failure prevents inspiratory augmentation venous return
third heart sound low frequency vibration range hz dull thudding quality
times may difficult tell actual sound sensation imparted ear listener
intense vibrations may add duration suggest short diastolic murmur
techniques increase venous return size ventricular cavityrecumbent position elevation legs exercise squatting volume expansionaugment intensity
conversely sound becomes softer disappears standing diuresis hemorrhage dialysis
ventricular contraction mitral tricuspid valves closed atrial pressure rises v wave continuing influx venous blood atria
early diastole ventricular pressure falls atrial pressure atrioventricular valves open wide blood rapidly drains atria descent ventricles
ventricles quickly become distended moving toward chest wall elastic distensibility ventricular wall reached rapid inflow blood checked
termination early diastolic filling period third heart sound may occur figure
genesis sound controversial
previously thought intracardiac sound arising vibrations valve cusps ventricular wall diastolic inflow suddenly decelerated
recent studies however shown third heart sound loudest external left ventricular cavity implying sound radiating intracardiac source
possible explanations include impact ventricle inner chest wall sound originating within ventricular apex due sudden limitation longitudinal expansion
factors seem relate presence intensity third heart sound include age atrial pressure unimpeded flow across atrioventricular valve rate early diastolic relaxation distensibility ventricle blood volume ventricular cavity size diastolic momentum heart degree contact coupling chest wall thickness character chest wall position patient
children adults age may normal third heart sound
explanation physiologic identical timing frequency pathologic counterpart unknown
age significance third heart sound must judged presence absence significant heart disease
age third heart sound usually abnormal correlates dysfunction volume overload ventricles
cause ventricular dysfunction including ischemic heart disease dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myocarditis cor pulmonale acute valvular regurgitation may qualify
myocardial ischemia without ventricular dysfunction volume overload cause
presence sensitive indicator ventricular dysfunction
cause significant increase volume load ventricles cause
examples include valvular regurgitation high output states anemia pregnancy arteriovenous fistula thyrotoxicosis left right intracardiac shunts complete v block renal failure volume overload excessive fluids blood transfusion
although third heart sound important clue heart failure volume overload appear problem relatively far advanced
patients reasons clear chest size obesity lung disease may never heard despite severe hemodynamic impairment
therefore absence third heart sound used exclude ventricular dysfunction volume overload
addition intensity third heart sound influenced several factors correlates roughly clinical status patient
third heart sound must differentiated diastolic sounds
competing possibilities include splitting second heart sound opening snap mitral tricuspid valve diastolic click related mitral valve prolapse tumor plop left atrial myxoma pericardial knock summation gallop atrial gallop
