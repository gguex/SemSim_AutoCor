information derived assessment jugular venous pulse includes determination mean venous pressure venous pulse contour presence type cardiac dysrhythmias
jugular venous pressure usually assessed observing right side patient neck
normal mean jugular venous pressure determined vertical distance midpoint right atrium cm ho
deviations normal range reflect either hypovolemia e mean venous pressure less cm ho impaired cardiac filling e mean venous pressure greater cm ho
normal jugular venous pulse contains three positive waves
convention labeled c v figure
positive deflections occur respectively carotid upstroke p wave ecg wave simultaneous upstroke carotid pulse c wave ventricular systole tricuspid valve opens v wave
wave generated atrial contraction actively fills right ventricle end diastole
c wave caused either transmission carotid arterial impulse external internal jugular veins bulging tricuspid valve right atrium early systole
v wave reflects passive increase pressure volume right atrium fills late systole early diastole
normally crests v waves approximately equal amplitude
descents troughs figure
jugular venous pulse occur c wave x descent c v wave x descent v wave descent
x x descents reflect movement lower portion right atrium toward right ventricle final phases ventricular systole
descent represents abrupt termination downstroke v wave early diastole tricuspid valve opens right ventricle begins fill passively
normally descent neither brisk deep x descent
abnormalities jugular venous pulse may reflected either mean pressure amplitude configuration positive waves negative troughs sequence absence positive waves
chapter emphasis placed measurement jugular venous pressure use venous pulse determine cardiac rhythm common cardiac problems pulmonary hypertension tricuspid regurgitation constrictive pericarditis
evaluation jugular venous pulse perhaps one misunderstood difficult master physical diagnosis techniques
understood practiced repetitive manner physical examination mysticism surrounding assessment jugular venous pulse disappears
nevertheless attention basic points crucial proper examination venous pulse
first patient must positioned manner physician observe venous pulse
thus neck chest must bared permit unobstructed view midportion sternum antihelix ears
requires dressing gown preferrably opening patient back positioned level nipples
moreover woman long hair tucked way behind head
second patient reclining comfortable position
except patient comfort exact angle inclination horizontal relatively unimportant
indeed angle even need reported physical examination since mean venous pressure given units centimeters water absolute number
general patients dyspneic tolerate reclining angles less degrees horizontal thus initial position head bed
third examining table hospital bed raised comfortable height physician
cardiac examinationif performed properlyis time consuming must hurried physical discomfort physician part detract adeptness bedside skills
fourth adequate light source strong beam must readily available
source may either pocket flashlight strong battery bedside lamp physician direct
ambient room window lighting usually good directed artificial lighting
light source directed tangentially approximately degree angle saggital plane behind right midscapular area across right side neck toward midline figure
examiner locate direct observation venous pulsations right side neck
usually patient chin must extended enhance observation
care exercised sternocleidomastoid muscle excessively tensed thus compressing external internal jugular veins obliterating pulsations
crucial examiner certain distinguish venous arterial pulsations top venous column recognized
former accomplished seeking three crests venous pulse comparing carotid arterial pulse
find easiest observe pulsations right side neck timing carotid pulse left side patient neck using right third finger figure
still uncertain whether observing venous pulse try obliterate venous pulse placing right thumb index finger across base patient right neck figure
compressing area force approximately mm hg venous pulse obliterated
movement remains observed characteristic monophasic contour carotid pulse
maneuver important continue cast tangential light across right side neck order observe contour various pulses
next step determine height mean jugular venous pressure measured centimeters water midpoint right atrium
latter position chosen standard reference point hemodynamic measurements catheterization laboratory
moreover midpoint right atrium constant fixed relationship e cm sternal angle louis regardless patient anatomic position
thus whether patient lying flat sitting erect anatomic relationship holds true
determine mean jugular venous pressure examiner observe nadir venous column inspiration crest column expiration
next midpoint excursion venous pulse normal respiratory cycles estimated visually
exaggerated breathing breath holding distorts normal mean venous pressure avoided
horizontal line drawn estimated point intersect vertical line erected perpendicular ground sternal angle louis
distance sternal angle intercept measured figure
sum distanceplus obligatory cm fixed relationship midpoint right atriumrepresents mean jugular venous pressure
assuming top venous column observed degree patient inclination horizontal stated
ruler may used measure distance intercept sternal angle louis appliance may always readily available
width observer fingers known may serve purpose
next examiner observes rise fall venous pressure normal inspiration expiration
normally mean venous pressure falls inspiration
especially important patient perform valsalva maneuver hold breath procedure
finally examiner applies firm persistent pressure liver seconds observing mean jugular venous pressure
normally either rise transient e sec rise mean jugular venous pressure
sustained increase mean venous pressure abdominal compression released abnormal indicates impaired right heart function
abnormal response called hepatojugular reflux
determining mean jugular venous pressure venous pulse contour examined simultaneously observing venous pulse right side neck palpating left carotid artery figure
crest jugular venous pulse immediately preceding carotid impulse wave occurring carotid upstroke c wave occurring carotid impulse peaked v wave
wave c waves occur relatively close together v wave observed separated longer interval
anatomic relationships right internal external jugular veins right atrium important understanding clinical evaluation venous pulse
right internal jugular vein communicates directly right atrium via superior vena cava
functional valve junction internal jugular vein superior vena cava
usually however valve impede phasic flow blood right atrium
thus wave form generated phasic flow right atrium accurately reflected internal jugular vein
external jugular vein descends angle mandible middle clavicle posterior border sternocleidomastoid muscle
external jugular vein possesses valves occasionally visible
relatively direct line right external internal jugular veins compared left external internal jugular veins make right jugular vein preferred system assessing venous pressure pulse contour
suggested blood flow within external jugular vein nonpulsatile thus used assess contour jugular venous pulse exerience contrary view
thus either external internal jugular vein may useful assessment mean venous pressure pulse contour
determining mean jugular venous pressure one assumes filling pressure right atrium right ventricle mirror left atrium left ventricle
relationship usually correct
thus mean jugular venous pressure greater cm ho usually indicates volume overload low jugular venous pressure e less cm ho usually indicates hypovolemia
important notable exceptions relationship
first acute left ventricular failure may caused myocardial infarction may significantly raise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure without raising mean right atrial jugular venous pressures
second pulmonary hypertension tricuspid insufficiency stenosis may associated elevated mean right atrial jugular venous pressures leaving left heart pressures unaffected
using mean jugular venous pressure clinical practice physician must correlate bedside measurement information gained history physical examination
combination perhaps frequently missed physical finding cardiovascular examination usually occurs patient severe biventricular congestive heart failure constrictive pericarditis cardiac tamponade
upon examination external jugular veins observed distended patient lying head elevated degrees
clue determing mean venous pressure correctly instances search presence pulsations higher neck usually around level earlobe
occasionally examiner must patient sit erect even stand order observe top venous column blood
next examiner compress junction external internal jugular veins thumb observing movement neck
firm even pressure approximately cm ho well systolic blood pressure pulsations neck observed ceaseor least become significantly reduced amplitude
circumstances correct measurement jugular venous pressure made
cause dissociation uncertain although venoconstriction marked elevations plasma catecholamines accompany pathologic states usually cited
giant waves classically described leaping eye greater height usually perceived figure
two causes giant waves decreased right ventricular compliance tricuspid stenosis
causes former pulmonary valve stenosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated pulmonary hypertension restrictive cardiomyopathy decreases right ventricular compliance
conditions force right atrial contraction increased generates giant wave atrial systole
pulmonic valve stenosis tricuspid stenosis uncommon diseases adults giant waves almost invariably indicate either pulmonary arterial hypertension restrictive cardiomyopathy involving right ventricle
classic condition causing slow descent tricuspid stenosis emptying right atrium right ventricle delayed
conditions may cause abnormality right atrial myxoma thrombus constrictive pericarditis isolated pericardial constriction right atrioventricular groove
three conditions uncommon
normally mean venous pressure falls passive inspiration phasic flow blood occurs superior vena cava right ventricle accommodates increased venous return
constrictive pericarditis present phasic blood flow occur superior vena cava
thus inspiration mean venous pressure rises kussmaul sign
unfortunately sign sensitive specific constrictive pericarditis may also observed right ventricular infarctions restrictive cardiomyopathies
cannon waves abnormalities wave occur right atrial contraction takes place closed tricuspid valve figure
classic condition disordered cardiac contraction occurs complete heart block
atrial contraction occurs appropriate time ventricular ectopic beat however cannon waves may also observed
irregular cannon waves observed patient tachycardia dysrhythmia likely ventricular tachycardia
unlike giant waves uniform height observed cardiac cycle cannon waves variable height occur sporadically variable realtionship atrial contraction ventricular systole
presence atrial flutter normal wave replaced flutter fibrillatory waves
latter generally lower amplitude regularity e min difficult observe
patient atrial fibrillation organized atrial activity wave jugular venous pulse lost altogether
cv waves tricuspid insufficiency may also seen
unlike normal jugular venous contour patients marked tricuspid insufficiency c v waves merge produce broad positive wave called cv wave occurs simultaneously carotid pulse figure
lesser degrees tricuspid insufficiency associated v waves quite broad may clear separation c wave
brisk x descents may occur diastole
usually descents jugular venous pulse brisk excessively rapid x descent characteristically deeper descent
right ventricular filling becomes hindered e setting constrictive pericarditis right ventricular failure descents become unusually rapid
instances contour jugular venous pulse may described flicking x descents may said describe w shaped pattern figure
description obviously somewhat subjective careful observation patients diseases verify veracity observations
moreover constrictive pericarditis descent often deeper x descent friedreich sign
