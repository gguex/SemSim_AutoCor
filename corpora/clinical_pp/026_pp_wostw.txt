diastolic murmur sound duration occurring diastole
diastolic murmurs imply alteration anatomy function cardiovascular structures
four commonly encountered diastolic murmurs include aortic pulmonary valve regurgitation mitral tricuspid valve rumbles table
compared systolic murmurs diastolic murmurs usually difficult hear certain auscultatory techniques essential detection
murmur aortic regurgitation begins aortic component second sound decrescendo intensity variable duration diastole
usually high frequency blowing sound often heard best along left lower sternal border although occasionally second right intercostal space
may maximum intensity along right sternal border see discussion later chapter
rarely murmur may isolated apex impulse
detection first think blowing high frequency sound coming distance simulate purse lips tightly blow
place diaphragm stethoscope along left sternal border firm pressure enough pressure leave slight indentation skin removed
fingers may used hold stethoscope avoid extraneous noise tremor finger muscles palm hand may better
patient instructed dont breathe end expiration told take deep breath blow relax dont breathe
command hold breath may cause patient take deep breath hold
murmur heard left lower sternal border patient supine auscultation similar fashion performed second right intercostal space along right sternal border
murmur may heard listening one areas patient sitting leaning forward relaxed expiratory apnea
bedside maneuver transiently increases blood pressure may intensify bring murmur
hand grip squatting useful
proper timing cardiac cycle essential
heart rate greater abbreviates diastole systolic diastolic duration nearly equal
situation even loud murmur aortic regurgitation may mistaken systolic murmur
simultaneous palpation carotid pulse essential avoid error
murmur pulmonary valve regurgitation associated pulmonary hypertension early diastolic decrescendo murmur beginning pulmonary component second sound best heard along upper left sternal border
auscultatory techniques like aortic regurgitation
quality pulmonary valve regurgitation similar aortic regurgitation differentiation may difficult
murmur pulmonary valve regurgitation may increase intensity inspiration
association mitral regurgitation intensity may actually decrease inspiration
presence bounding pulses wide pulse pressure support diagnosis aortic regurgitation
pulmonary valve regurgitation frequently results severe pulmonary hypertension
murmur associated mitral stenosis pulmonary hypertension usually represents trivial aortic regurgitation simply aortic regurgitation common pulmonary valve regurgitation clinical setting
murmur pulmonary valve regurgitation without associated pulmonary hypertension pulmonary valve endocarditis congenital abnormalities pulmonary valve lower frequency may middiastolic crescendodecrescendo pattern intensity
mitral valve rumble diastolic murmur low frequency occurring middiastole andor late diastole presystole
frequently localized small area apex impulse
patient relaxed left lateral decubitus position apex impulse localized
bell stethoscope applied light pressure enough make contact skin
concentrate diastole move bell adjacent apex impulse
listen middiastole first sound
murmur due mitral stenosis may accentuation first sound opening snap
opening snap high frequency sound introduces middiastolic component rumble occurs
second second sound
maneuvers transiently increase cardiac output sit ups coughing squatting may aid detection
apex impulse easily located scanning area listening point maximum intensity heart sounds help identify apex impulse area concentrate mitral diastolic rumble
tricuspid valve rumble similar characteristics mitral rumble localized along left lower sternal border increases intensity inspiration
bell placed light pressure exploring third fifth interspaces concentrating diastole inspiration expiration
similar maneuvers increase venous return may augment murmur
inspiratory accentuation aids differentiation mitral rumble although latter usually radiate left sternal border
accentuation first sound tricuspid component tricuspid opening snap may also present
presystolic component tricuspid valve rumble often crescendodecrescendo unlike crescendo pattern mitral rumble
aortic valve regurgitation result loss perfect apposition aortic cusps diastole
may deformity cusps supporting structures
problem may develop gradually rheumatic heart disease acutely bacterial endocarditis
symptoms physical findings depend severity regurgitation duration development
minimal regurgitant volume causes abnormalities presence murmur
regurgitant volume increases diastolic filling left ventricle gradually progresses increase stroke volume left ventricular dilatation hypertrophy
peripheral pulses hyperdynamic pulse pressure widened
apical diastolic rumble austin flint may heard apex
due partial closure anterior leaflet mitral valve
apex impulse becomes laterally displaced sustained
resting exercise cardiac output maintained progressive left ventricular dilatation causes impairment myocardial function
easy fatigue dyspnea ensue
severe left ventricular dilatation causes inadequate apposition mitral leaflets murmur mitral regurgitation heard
left ventricular diastolic pressure increases reflected left atrium pulmonary veins eventual pulmonary hypertension right ventricular dilatation tricuspid regurgitation elevated jugular venous pressure develop
presence widened pulse pressure murmur continues throughout diastole apical diastolic rumble austin flint rumble imply significant aortic regurgitation even development pulmonary hypertension right heart failure
pulmonary valve regurgitation result imperfect cusp apposition resulting deformity cusps supporting structures
frequently secondary severe pulmonary hypertension dilatation supporting structures
cases regurgitant volume small hemodynamic importance
pulmonary valve regurgitation may also occur normal pulmonary artery pressures
cases even large regurgitation volume usually well tolerated right ventricle
right ventricular dilatation elevation jugular venous pressure
rarely severe right heart failure develop
mitral valve rumble may caused normal reduced blood flow stenotic valve mitral stenosis
left atrial myxoma cor triatriatum localized left atrioventricular groove pericardial constriction may also cause left atrial left ventricular diastolic blood pressure gradient mitral valve rumble
situations cause increase diastolic mitral valve blood flow normal valve may also cause rumble mitral regurgitation ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus complete heart block
aortic regurgitation moderate severity also associated diastolic rumble austin flint results regurgitant volume causing vibrations mitral leaflet andor displacement anterior leaflet toward closed position
mitral valve stenosis commonly result previous rheumatic fever later causes leaflet scarification fusion commissures
mild reduction orifice size middiastolic presystolic murmur heard time peak diastolic flow similarly small pressure gradient present
anterior mitral leaflet stiffens still mobile opening produces sound opening snap closure accentuates intensity first heart sound
stenosis progresses left atrial pressure rises proportion orifice reduction flow cardiac output
eventual rises left atrial pressure reflected pulmonary veins capillary bed pulmonary arteries
even mild stenosis pulmonary edema may develop acutely rapid heart rate causing abbreviation diastolic filling time
left atrial pressure increases leaflets open quickly diastole opening snap moves closer second sound
pulmonary hypertension develops pulmonary component second sound accentuated
symptoms rest may minimal exercise left atrial pressure increases dyspnea prominent symptom
progression cardiac output increase appropriately exercise easy fatigue occurs
pulmonary hypertension initially results right ventricular hypertrophy parasternal lift felt pulmonary hypertension long standing right ventricular dilatation tricuspid regurgitation systemic venous hypertension develop
waves prominent jugular venous pulsations development tricuspid regurgitation v wave large
calcification mitral leaflets may produce immobility opening snap accentuated first sound lost
right ventricular dysfunction develops even resting cardiac output reduced reduction mitral valve flow soften intensity rumble
tricuspid valve rumble caused valvular deformity orifice stenosis may secondary rheumatic heart disease ebstein anomaly carcinoid heart disease
right atrial myxoma may also cause diastolic tricuspid obstruction
rumble may also result increased flow across normal valve atrial septal defect tricuspid regurgitation
tricuspid valve stenosis may congenital origin commonly result rheumatic heart disease rarely isolated valvular lesion
cases manifestations may subtle
diastolic rumble opening snap similar mitral stenosis
location left lower sternal border inspiratory accentuation aid differentiation
jugular venous pulsations show attenuation descent prominence wave
severe tricuspid stenosis cause hepatomegaly ascites peripheral edema exercise intolerance
diastolic murmurs may present without alteration cardiac function
detection remains important proper care patient
presence murmur could caused alteration cardiac structures indicates need bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis
patients evaluated regular basis progression valvular problem
prior rheumatic fever possible cause prophylaxis recurrence given
reasons diastolic murmurs diligently sought every patient examined
patients certain symptoms physical findings laboratory abnormalities specific valvular problems considered
presence apparent noncardiac problems may also helpful clues
aortic valve regurgitation considered patients following complaints findings dyspnea fatigue angina pectoris congestive heart failure chest pain suggestive aortic dissection symptoms signs suspicious endocarditis presence wide pulse pressure hyperdynamic pulses radiographic evidence enlarged aorta especially ascending portion
demand careful search murmur aortic valve regurgitation
diagnosis established etiology severity addressed
many causes aortic valve regurgitation important influence management prognosis
patient mild moderate aortic valve regurgitation due rheumatic heart disease would require cardiac surgery aortic dissection etiology emergent surgery may necessary
bacterial endocarditis prompt antibiotic therapy essential patient monitored rapid progression aortic regurgitation requiring emergent surgery
pulmonary valve regurgitation commonly caused pulmonary hypertension
although pulmonary hypertension cause may result pulmonary valve regurgitation due mitral stenosis cor pulmonale recurrent pulmonary emboli primary pulmonary hypertension common
less common causes pulmonary valve regurgitation include endocarditis rheumatic fever cardiac tumors carcinoid
bacterial endocarditis isolated pulmonary valve may present protracted febrile illness
character murmur may change one associated normal pulmonary artery pressure one associated pulmonary hypertension illness complicated recurrent septic pulmonary emboli
echocardiography mode two dimensional doppler studies may useful tools recognition pulmonary valve regurgitation aid determination etiology
presenting problems patients mitral valve stenosis also variable
exertional dyspnea hemoptysis paroxysmal sustained atrial fibrillation especially vertical qrs axis systemic emboli acute pulmonary edema especially developing coincident atrial fibrillation hoarseness radiographic evidence enlarged pulmonary arteries especially left atrial enlargement demand careful search mitral valve stenosis
cases severe long standing mitral valve stenosis signs symptoms congestive heart failure ascites jaundice peripheral edema may presenting problem
left atrial myxoma may mimic mitral valve stenosis symptoms physical findings
diagnosis considered signs symptoms systemic illness e g weight loss fever anemia polycythemia elevated sedimentation rate immunoglobulins
early diastolic heart sound tumor plop sought auscultation
mode two dimensional echocardiography valuable tool diagnosis mitral stenosis also recognition left atrial myxoma utilized patient mitral stenosis suspected
since tricuspid valve stenosis commonly occurs concomitantly rheumatic valvular lesions may easily recognized
tricuspid valvular obstruction may cause prominent waves jugular venous pulsations hepatomegaly ascites peripheral edema
electrocardiographic evidence right atrial abnormality patient mitral valve stenosis may also serve helpful clue presence tricuspid valve stenosis
carcinoid syndrome considered patients either tricuspid pulmonary valve lesions since stenosis regurgitation either valve occur
