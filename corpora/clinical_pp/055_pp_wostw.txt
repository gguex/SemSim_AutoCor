epileptic seizure episode altered behavior resulting abnormal paroxysmal electrical discharge within gray matter brain
epilepsy consists recurrent epileptic seizures absence extraordinary provocation
widespread forceful repetitive contraction body musculature termed convulsion
convulsions necessarily specific epileptic seizures
coordinated involuntary motor activities occurring course seizure usually clouding consciousness called automatisms
despite recent advances electroencephalography neuroradiology history remains preeminent diagnosis epilepsy
diagnosis often depends testimony witness even patient description reliable witness avidly pursued time initial evaluation writing long distance telephone necessary

pathophysiology epileptic seizures appears involve two distinct mechanisms may overlap patient though seldom seizure
details seizure initiation propagation still completely understood electrical abnormalities extensively delineated
corticoreticular current term seizures characterized spike wave discharges generalized onset
classic clinical form corticoreticular epilepsy childhood absence classic laboratory model corticoreticular seizures generalized penicillin epilepsy cat
many years absence types seizures generalized onset designated centrencephalicthe presumption arose core gray structures brain including thalamus midbrain site origin explained simultaneous appearance cerebral cortex
concept generally abandoned many reasons salient anatomical correlate ever found humans experimental animals would confirm seizure origin centrencephalon experimental manipulation confined thalamus midbrain ever produced true spike wave discharges characteristic naturally occurring epilepsies
instead extensive work feline penicillin model shown cortex core gray structures appear involved
volleys electrical activity become spike wave seem originate thalamus major pertuberation cortex otherwise normal thalamic outputs encounter abnormal excitability transformed spike wave
application penicillin cortex alone produce generalized spike wave application thalamus mid brain alone
discharges corticoreticular epilepsy travel along normal neuronal pathways normal synaptic mechanisms widespread synchrony spectacularly prominent eeg may surprisingly little effect external behavior patients never followed postictal confusion
tendency corticoreticular epilepsy generally considered familial trait variable expression rarely exacerbated anatomic lesion
however individual seizures may precipitated specific factors including alkalosis hyperventilation metabolic imbalance flashing lights sleep deprivation emotional stress
seizures focal origin secondarily generalized appear different neurophysiology
major underlying electrical abnormality paroxysmal depolarization shift pds individual neurons clusters neurons undergo striking marked prolonged depolarization may last many seconds
pds followed abnormal degree hyperpolarization may persist many minutes
pds cell may produce action potentials high rate subsequent hyperpolarization react normally synaptic inputs
experimental preparations pds appears initiated relatively normal synaptic mechanisms may also lead strikingly aberrant phenomena retrograde conduction action potential backward across synapse
exact mechanisms leading pds unknown
many researchers believe involve abnormal architecture cell body dendrites secondary local cortical injury
many convulsant agents including several metals produce pds applied directly cortex
uptake iron hemosiderin may produce neuronal abnormalities provides one possible link brain lesions later development focal epilepsies
certain portions brain appear much likely others produce epileptic focus reaction injury
adults susceptible areas motor cortex temporal lobe especially limbic structures hippocampus amygdala
neurons normal hippocampus shown produce spontaneous bursts action potentials resemble pds
furthermore proximity free edge tentorium sharp bony margins define middle fossa skull temporal lobe vulnerable trauma birth onward
factors help account relatively high incidence temporal foci partial epilepsies
interictal eeg spikes experimental focal epilepsies regularly associated pds closely resemble focal spikes eegs patients clinical seizure disorders
development focal seizures occasional secondary generalization appears involve spread pds larger larger groups neurons
spread seen dramatically jacksonian seizures begin focally movement single body part march sequentially larger larger areas generalizing
pds discharges also conducted backward across synapse retrograde areas normally project cortex including thalamus
structures may widely rapidly disseminated
partial seizures generalized tonic clonic convulsions normal neuronal processing completely interrupted remains abnormal throughout duration hyperpolarization follows
probably explains postictal state usually follows focal generalized tonic clonic seizures
occasionally focal deficit motor sensory higher cortical function persists several hours todd paralysis
seizures focal secondarily generalized may begin age high correlation structural cerebral disease may static progressive
contrast corticoreticular epilepsies primary generalized epilepsies usually begin childhood adolescence associated structural brain disease
nonetheless distinction two basic mechanisms epilepsies absolute many patients classical absence also tonic clonic convulsions patients seizures may begin generalized spike wave characteristic corticoreticular discharge evolving convulsions characteristic pds
given existence two different mechanisms epileptic seizures might anticipated anticonvulsants used treat could divided two different classes
ethosuximide recently undisputed first choice childhood absence ineffective focal generalized major motor seizures
phenobarbital primidone carbamazepine phenytoin effective focal generalized convulsive seizures little usefulness absence
valproic acid agent appears effective categories seizure
valproic acid appears augment effect gaba inhibitory neurotransmitter widely distributed cerebral cortex
recent advent long term monitoring techniques great majority patients seizures difficult capture eeg laboratory significant fraction lack interictal eeg abnormalities seizures
reason international classification epileptic seizures based clinical presumed electrical phenomena
current scheme given table
partial preferred focal simple partial seizures involve focal phenomena without alteration consciousness
category complex partial seizures deserves special mention high incidence different interpretations historically placed word complex
though term formerly referred variety psychic phenomena present implies merely patient lacks awareness recall part episode presumption discharge spread areas affecting memory
old terms petit mal grand mal discouraged
former originally synonymous absence popularly misused mean almost anything else short convulsion
latter less useful descriptive terms tonic clonic massive myoclonic seizures
clinical manifestations epilepsy depend area brain involved seizure plus rapidity extent spreads
many symptoms predicted cortical anatomy implied table
important distinction primary generalized epilepsies corticoreticular epilepsies focal generalize secondarily
work management therapy strongly influenced classification seizures
primary generalized seizures require search environmental precipitants seldom imply progressive brain lesion
ct scan healthy child absence per second spike wave eeg waste time
radiological work close follow usually indicated seizures focal characteristics history eeg acquired adulthood suspected secondarily generalized even demonstrated available history
major exception requirement common childhood disorder rolandic epilepsy eeg shows focal highly characteristic spike discharges association progressive disease
