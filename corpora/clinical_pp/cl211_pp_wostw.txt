weakness refers decrease muscle strength
fatigue tiredness may either independent associated exertion
complaints weakness fatigue among common challenging problems encountered clinicians
patients may use terms describe variety symptoms physician attempt obtain precise understanding problem
weakness fatigue nonspecific symptoms may encountered bewildering number medical psychiatric disorders also may expected physiologic consequence normal human activities
patients weakness fatigue self limited conditions seek medical care
among visit physician weakness fatigue often part easily identified symptom complex
patient presents chronic weakness fatigue sole major complaint may represent difficult diagnostic therapeutic problem
bedside examination unique value evaluating symptoms
initial history physical examination usually allow clinician characterize problem medical psychiatric physiologic origin
specific patient weakness fatigue may due multiple causes cause may initially apparent
precise understanding patient description weakness fatigue imperative
loss muscle strength problem vague loss energy weariness lassitude
true weakness usually indicates medical disorder
fatigue contrast may result medical psychiatric physiologic causes
symptoms confused weakness
example patients speak weakness actually experiencing shortness breath generalized malaise joint pain limitation motion
obtain history encouraging patient tell story problem
unstructured format supplemented needed specific questions weakness fatigue
onset temporal course distribution localized vs
generalized exacerbating relieving factors associated signs symptoms setting problem developed impact daily activities
weakness beginning childhood may result duchenne muscular dystrophy
sudden onset weakness suggests cerebrovascular accident diagnosis strongly considered weakness localized neuroanatomic distribution
progressively severe weakness fatigue seen metastatic carcinoma
recurring episodes weakness raise question periodic paralysis
weakness exacerbated effort relieved rest characteristic myasthenia gravis
proximal muscle weakness suggests myopathy whereas distal muscle weakness consistent peripheral neuropathy pyramidal tract disorder
loss interest daily activities insomnia may indicate depressive state
recurring episodes apprehension tremulousness palpitations seen generalized anxiety
presence fever may point infection malignancy collagen vascular disease
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea indicative left ventricular failure
inflammatory bowel disease considered patient chronic diarrhea
weakness fatigue occur jogging fasting insufficient sleep likely explained normal physiologic mechanisms table
physically demanding occupations pregnancy commonly associated fatigue
learn impact symptoms patient routine daily activities combing hair climbing stairs speaking
difficulty combing hair climbing stairs suggests weakness proximal muscles
data may help localize problem shed light specific diagnosis provide insight patient coping skills
medical surgical psychiatric problems considered possible causes weakness fatigue tables
prescription counter medications listed
frequently used medications antihypertensives sedative hypnotics antidepressants tranquilizers antihistamines common causes fatigue
psychosocial history provide personal picture patient including data lifestyle home life occupational experiences habits sexual practices
interpersonal conflicts recent losses threatening situations identified
data great importance clinical surveys chronic weakness fatigue cite psychosocial problems common cause symptoms
carefully elicited family history may identify heritable disorder could account problem
example may strong family history depression
essential component work complete review systems
first examine systems discussed present illness thereafter explore remaining systems depth
approach may lead unsuspected problem
example polyuria may first clue diagnosis diabetes mellitus
history dark urine raise question hepatitis
diagnosis somatoform disorder hypochondriasis must considered patient multiple physical symptoms demonstrable organic findings
physical examination may provide essential data obtainable interview laboratory studies
particular testing muscle strength individual muscles groups muscles essential help distinguish true weakness fatigue
examiner perform detailed neuromuscular examination checking muscle atrophy abnormal muscle tone abnormal deep tendon reflexes pathologic reflexes fasciculations muscle tenderness sensory deficits
presence neuromuscular problem analysis neurologic findings may allow clinician distinguish cerebral spinal peripheral nerve myopathic processes
history provide focus general physical examination systems meticulously examined
general appearance may suggest endocrine disorder
measuring blood pressure erect position may document orthostatic hypotension cause weakness fatigue
palpating enlarged spleen may lead diagnosis infectious mononucleosis
formal mental status examination vital
include assessment thought content orientation emotional status memory constructional ability abstract reasoning
abnormalities may point diagnosis early dementia affective disorder presenting weakness fatigue
history physical examination usually provide correct diagnosis laboratory studies often play primarily confirmatory role
satisfactory explanation weakness fatigue result initial clinical examination history physical examination repeated
diagnostic possibilities systematically reviewed tables
example category endocrine metabolic causes weakness fatigue include diabetes mellitus hypoglycemia hypopituitarism acromegaly addison disease cushing syndrome iatrogenic corticosteroid myopathy hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism serum electrolyte abnormalities hypophosphatemia hypercalcemia hypokalemia hyperkalemia also associated symptoms may lead specific diagnosis
clues clinical examination may suggest specific laboratory test performed acth stimulation test addison disease
psychiatric diagnosis based presence positive findings simply absence medical explanation problem
diagnosis made patient told nothing wrong instead patient advised careful follow necessary order collect additional data
thoughtful management support patient always important particularly instances diagnosis made effective therapy available chronic epstein barr virus infection
paucity data pathophysiologic mechanisms produce weakness fatigue
medical psychiatric theory suggest symptoms serve protective function
motor unit extensions cerebral cortex central understanding symptoms
cellular level basic problem may caused intrinsic neuromuscular pathology systemic disease compromises delivery adequate amounts oxygen substrate
finally events may cause afferent impulses reach brain interpreted weakness fatigue
feeling weak tired virtually universal human experience
clinician familiarity poses formidable challenge distinguish problem acute self limited often inconsequential problem chronic progressive often serious
weakness fatigue must never dismissed lightly since significance patient may represent first vague warning disease
fortunately thoughtful caring application bedside skills usually lead successful cost effective resolution problem
