urticaria consists discrete areas skin edema usually pruritic
angioedema involves deeper dermis subcutaneous tissue presents localized areas soft tissue swelling
urticarial lesions initially erythematous often progress central clearing give typical wheal flare appearance
lesions vary millimeters several centimeters diameter may serpiginous polycyclic borders
although commonly involving trunk proximal extremities lesions occur anywhere particularly common areas tight fitting clothing
lesions angioedema seldom pruritic produce uncomfortable burning sensation sometimes pain
angioedema common loose tissues around eyes mouth
urticaria angioedema occur together patients urticaria seen alone angioedema occurs alone cases
urticaria defined chronic lesions occur continuously intermittently longer weeks although somewhat arbitrary definition chronicity clinically useful
lesions chronic urticaria usually last several hours disappear one area reappear another
complete history physical examination often necessary identify major etiologic categories urticaria angioedema
allergy reactions physical agents familial disorders urticaria secondary underlying disease
acute urticaria may part generalized anaphylaxis often attributed specific allergic exposure seldom case chronic urticaria angioedema
allergens frequently implicated urticarial reactions include drugs insect stings foods chocolate eggs nuts shellfish
food additives food dyes preservatives also cause urticaria metabisulfites used restaurants antioxidants foods salads fresh fruit recently reported cause urticaria asthmatic reactions
antibiotics anticonvulsants analgesics phenothiazines drugs commonly identified
skin testing confirm ige mediated reactions limited number drugs biological agents penicillin insulin heterologous serum insect venom sometimes useful
urticaria resulting substances inhaled contacting skin rare may important occupational exposures
physical urticaria heat cold pressure vibration solar radiation exercise usually diagnosed patient history
cold induced urticaria solar urticaria manifest lesions exposed areas
cold induced urticaria result life threatening systemic reactions swimming cold water
generalized heat urticaria cholinergic urticaria produces characteristically small lesions mm diameter occurs situations causing cutaneous vasodilation exercise hot baths emotional upsets
dermatographia consists urticaria occurring skin stroking scratching common phenomenon seldom produces severe symptoms
urticaria angioedema vibration sustained pressure rare
hereditary angioedema autosomal dominant disorder characterized episodes angioedema without urticaria
contrast types chronic episodic angioedema upper airway obstruction abdominal pain common features
attacks angioedema usually last days
interval attacks highly variable ranging weeks months
patients hereditary angioedema low levels fourth component complement c even attacks
c level used screening test
level c low diagnosis confirmed documenting low levels decreased activity c esterase inhibitor deficient enzyme disorder
large number diseases reported association urticaria angioedema including infections connective tissue disorders hyperthyroidism neoplastic disease
associations uncommon however underlying disorder usually apparent history physical examination
infections associated urticaria include helminthic infections chronic sinusitis dental abscess particularly type b hepatitis
urticaria hepatitis usually occurs part prodrome associated malaise arthralgias sometimes arthritis fever
urticarial lesions frequently disappear patient becomes jaundiced
leukocytoclastic vasculitis often associated palpable purpura also present urticaria
patients urticarial vasculitis differ primary idiopathic urticaria higher prevalence findings fever arthralgias weight loss well laboratory evidence inflammation elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
individual urticarial lesions underlying vasculitis often last hours duration sometimes leave areas skin discoloration
severely affected patients frequently hypocomplementemia
diagnosis confirmed skin biopsy
cause chronic urticaria angioedema elude detection patients
definable causes apparent complete history physical examination
screening laboratory tests complete blood count urinalysis erythrocyte sedimentation rate may appropriate extensive laboratory studies radiologic procedures allergy testing seldom indicated
urticaria angioedema common patterns reaction wide variety stimuli acting different mechanisms
final common pathway vasodilation increased vascular permeability tissue edema
immediate hypersensitivity involving binding ige molecules receptors tissue mast cells responsible true allergic reactions
mast cells present skin concentrations cells per cubic millimeter found proximity blood vessels
complexes form antigens allergens ige mast cells surfaces series biochemical reactions occurs releasing vasoactive mediators histamine mast cell granules metabolites arachidonic acid membrane phospholipids
important products arachidonic acid metabolism include prostaglandins leukotrienes
ige mediated reactions also implicated types physical urticaria including cold urticaria dermatographia
urticaria also seen diseases circulating immune complexes systemic lupus erythematosus type b hepatitis
immune complexes activate complement cascade generating ca ca potent anaphylotoxins capable causing release histamine mediators mast cells
histamine also released directly mast cells pharmacologic action drugs opiate derivatives
mediator releasing action independent ige also demonstrated radiographic contrast media extracts foods including eggs strawberries shellfish
hereditary angioedema associated deficiency c esterase inhibitor serum protein inhibits activated first component complement also blocks fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin activated hageman factor kallikrein
minor trauma activate hageman factor often precipitates attacks
activation hageman factor may initiating event leading generation vasoactive substances complex interaction coagulation fibrinolytic kinin complement systems
cases chronic urticaria angioedema etiology pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown
entities cholinergic urticaria pathogenic mechanism unknown even though inciting stimulus may clearly defined
urticaria angioedema common conditions cumulative incidence general population
individuals episodes brief self limited probably result allergen exposure
acute urticaria angioedema part generalized anaphylactic reaction patients develop either one shortly drug administration insect sting observed improvement seen
chronic persistent urticaria occasionally clue important underlying disorder
contrast acute lesions however etiology chronic urticaria angioedema usually remains unknown
patients chronic idiopathic urticaria angioedema remission disease within months individuals disease may persist continuously intermittently years
recognizing signs symptoms hereditary angioedema important disease cause fatal airway obstruction effective prophylactic treatment available
