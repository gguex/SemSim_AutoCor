presents steps examination
nasal speculum transilluminator battery handle sterile swab culture material needed examination figures
clinics fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopes examination sinus ostia nasopharynx may necessary send patient screening sinus x rays
sinus examinations always done darkened area use decongestant spray oxymetazolin
neosynephrine encouraged
examination nose chapter careful external inspection carried notation made previous injury trauma congenital deformity
frontal maxillary sinuses transilluminated speculum used evaluate intranasal cavity figure
fiberoptic examination carried along percussion palpation maxillary frontal sinuses denote tenderness
equipment needed includes penlight headlight disposable tongue blades sterile swab culture rubber gloves palpation see figure
patient may need ct scan salivary glands extremely helpful evaluating occult lesions
examination area include inspection palate tonsillar fossae gums tongue cheeks teeth openings submaxillary parotid ducts chapters figures
careful bimanual palpation submaxillary gland figure
palpation massage parotids figure
observation secretion ducts carried
equipment needed evaluate area body consists disposable tongue blades use x rays jaw joints opened closed position
examination involves careful palpation jaw joints rest motion figure
patient asked bite firmly wooden tongue blade see elicit pain joint
tapping teeth metal probe may help identify isolated dental disease referred jaw joint area
equipment includes disposable tongue blades rubber gloves penlights headlights fiberoptic pharyngeal laryngeal scopes laryngeal mirrors sterile culture swabs
x ray often utilized document lesions around larynx pharynx particularly ct scans neck
rubber gloves used palpation tonsillar fossa base tongue
palpation thyroid figure larynx hyoid bone done chapter
mirror fiberoptic examinations vital order document motion vocal cords lesions epiglottis larynx
careful inspection face patient talks reveal many factors
examiner look carefully signs trauma previous facial surgery eye swelling bags eye might indicate fluid allergic disorders
quality skin quickly noted
patient evaluated presence good lighting preferably sunlight often helpful cosmetic surgery considered frontal profile photographs taken
examination face involves inspection blepharochalasia eyelid sagging excess wrinkling redundancy skin various areas chin neck upper neck face

patient asked perform basic facial movements smiling pursing lips closing eyes tightly document asymmetry motion previous facial paralysis
many specific general questions needed order accurately evaluate person communication disorder chapter
one first observations made loudness patient voice speaks since many patients conductive loss talk softly whereas patients sensorineural hearing impairment talk loudly
obvious response patient examiner normal voice provide clues severity hearing impairment
equipment needed evaluate ears properly consists wax curette round circular blunt end standard ear wax syringe cc plastic syringe
emesis basin catch water needed also
thin small wire applicator small tuft cotton end helpful remove secretion ear canal battery otoscope pneumatic attachment moving eardrum inward outward mandatory
penlight inspection outer meatus observation removing wax helpful figure
standard hydrogen peroxide aqueous zephiran helpful dissolve wax
standard hz tuning fork necessary adequate weber rinne testing
use electric audiometer impedance bridge routine mastoid films cultures ear canal ct scans temporal bone often needed complete evaluation
prior examination patient asked drum perforation previous ear surgery
none proper irrigate ear standard ear syringe
ear canal inspected penlight pinna moved discern possible tenderness
