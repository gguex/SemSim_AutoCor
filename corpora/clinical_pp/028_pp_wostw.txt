recognition edema often first step important challenging clinical exercise
cases optimal care patient edema depends identification cause table
accurate diagnosis requires complete record illness experienced transmitted patient review several pertinent systems thoughtful integrated physical examination well selected tests
chronologic structure history often revealing
patient illness may begun fluid induced symptoms nocturia paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea nocturnal angina
swelling may come patient attention tight fitting shoes rings puffy eyes
abrupt evolution edema one days suggests underlying cause deep venous occlusion cellulitis especially edema accompanied pain
less abrupt nevertheless rapid accumulation several days typical acute glomerulonephritis
gradual accumulation weeks months bespeaks insidious systemic illness
upright position often exacerbates idiopathic edema swelling last half menstrual cycle characterizes premenstrual syndrome
progressive accumulation fluid day resolution overnight imply physiologic disturbance mild persistence swelling little diurnal variation suggests disturbance profound
edema single extremity suggests local obstruction venous lymphatic drainage whereas generalized edema anasarca typical glomerulonephritis nephrotic syndrome congestive heart failure
physiologic disturbance may cause ascites pulmonary congestion pleural effusion edema patient often exhibits combination findings
cases ascertaining whether increased abdominal girth dyspnea appeared edema may helpful reaching diagnosis
ascites usually occurs first patients cirrhosis constructive pericarditis typically develops edema patients progressive right ventricular failure

careful review systems inquiries concerning drug ingestions dietary habits may also aid diagnosis
excessive foam toilet bowl indicative albuminuria
symptoms suggestive thiamine deficiency portal hypertension hepatocellular insufficiency thyrotoxicosis anemia obviously germane
nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents commonly cause salt retention many drugs incite glomerular tubulointerstitial nephropathies
discontinuation diuretics deviation dietary salt restriction lead relapses edema irrespective cause

although grading systems provide shorthand describing leg edema preferable report location extent completely
acute swelling typically pits minimal pressure whereas chronic edema usually offers resistance
chronic edema often associated cutaneous hyperpigmentation occasionally provokes eczematous dermatitis
distribution edema provides numerous diagnostic hints
edema confined one leg consider deep vein thrombosis postphlebitic changes cellulitis lymphangitis inguinal lymphadenopathy
one arm involved consider venous lymphatic occlusion cellulitis direct special attention ipsilateral breast axilla
arms swollen obstruction superior vena cava likely cause especially face also suffused

edema accumulates interstitial spaces surrounding capillary beds
movement fluid capillaries interstitium governed formula
jv rate flux across capillary membrane k constant denoting membrane permeability pc capillary hydraulic pressure pi interstitial hydraulic pressure pc capillary oncotic pressure pi interstitial oncotic pressure
equation indicates capillary hydraulic pressure interstitial oncotic pressure enhance flux capillaries capillary oncotic pressure interstitial hydraulic pressure enhance flux capillaries
pressures called starling forces honor physiologist clearly articulated relationship
although absolute values vary considerably different sites body interplay among given site always predisposes net accumulation interstitial fluid
fortunately lymphatic channels return fluid systemic circulation rapidly accumulates thus preventing edema formation maintaining normal intravascular volume
presence edema implies interstitial fluid volume exceeds normal several liters
rare exceptions net renal sodium retention generates excess
time edema accumulate one starling forces altered lymphatic drainage interrupted
conditions primary lesion imbalance starling forces accelerates transudation fluid interstitium secondary depletion intravascular volume perceived carotid renal arterial baroreceptors sodium conservation stimulated
disorders inappropriate sodium retention proximal disturbance resulting expansion extracellular fluid volume produces secondary alterations starling forces lead formation edema
least one edema forming state nephrotic syndrome unphysiologic sodium conservation reduction oncotic pressure occur simultaneously
premenstrual syndrome idiopathic edema hypothyroidism primary lesions matter debate
mechanisms kidneys retain sodium response hypoperfusion viewed reflexes afferent sensor efferent effector limbs
although sensors intravascular volume described liver renal parenchyma cardiac atria important human edema forming conditions probably carotid baroreceptor juxtaglomerular apparatus
impulses arising carotid baroreceptor enter central nervous system via ninth tenth cranial nerves resulting sympathetic outflow kidney modulates intraglomerular hemodynamics probably stimulates proximal tubular sodium reabsorption directly
kidney hypoperfusion causes autoregulatory dilation afferent arterioles stimulates renin release specialized cells arteriolar wall
renin catalyzes intraglomerular synthesis angiotensin ii selectively increases efferent arteriolar resistance
consequent increase filtration traction leads decline hydraulic pressure elevation oncotic pressure peritubular capillaries thus enhancing proximal tubular sodium reabsorption supporting glomerular filtration
systemically renin increases level circulating angiotensin ii stimulates adrenal synthesis aldosterone
hormone enhances distal nephron sodium reabsorption exchange potassium hydrogen
pathogenesis edema various disease states ranges straightforward exceedingly complex
several conditions inappropriate renal conservation sodium initial disturbance alterations peripheral starling forces follow
acute glomerulonephritis forms acute chronic renal failure category
refeeding edema sometimes complicates administration calories malnourished individuals probably due insulin mediated sodium retention
edema follow ingestion nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents attributed inhibition renal prostaglandin synthesis
toxemia pregnancy unexplained extracellular fluid volume expansion causes edema systemic hypertension suppressing rennin angiotensin aldosterone axis
edema forming states alterations peripheral starling forces appear stimulate sodium retention depleting intravascular volume
states include peripheral deep vein thrombosis postphlebitic venous insufficiency increased intracapillary hydraulic pressure augments transudation interstitium states characterized excessive capillary permeability transudation accelerated diseases lymphatics interstitial fluid accumulated normal rate returned systemic circulation
renal function edema forming states characterized high cardiac output also physiologically appropriate
high output states thought result one many low resistance circuits cardiovascular system
circuits may pervade microvasculature probably case anemia thyrotoxicosis beriberi paget disease may large unitary traumatic arteriovenous fistula
constant diversion flow kidneys causes retention sodium elevation intravascular hydraulic pressure capillary beds progressive edema
cardiac disorders often cause edema
whether inciting pathology involves left heart entire myocardium pericardium lungs evolution edema implies mean right atrial pressure elevated
peripheral venous pressure must rise secondarily order maintain venous return gravity adjustment accelerates transudation peripheral interstitium
time right atrial hypertension prevents compensatory increase lymphatic return
whereas peripheral edema follows dyspnea months years initial lesion left heart lungs two symptoms often appear simultaneously diffuse cardiomyopathies
time honored explication nephrotic syndrome states renal protein loss leads reduction plasma colloid oncotic pressure resulting imbalance starling forces favors interstitial fluid accumulation expense plasma volume kidneys attempt reconstitute retaining salt water
unfortunately since hypoalbuminemia persists renal response merely restores imbalance initiated edema formation process continues unabated
attractive formulation variance several observations
first serum albumin concentration edema forms nephrotic syndrome varies considerably patient patient
second congenital analbuminemia may associated edema
third even proteinuria unaccompanied glomerular inflammation nil disease blood volume blood pressure often higher nephrotic syndrome remission
fourth correlation nephrotic patients serum albumin plasma renin activity ordinarily sensitive marker renal hypoperfusion cases despite hypoalbuminemia plasma renin activity may depressed
even reninernia significant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition little effect blood pressure reninaldosterone axis activated response volume depletion reduction pressure would occur
together observations suggest kidneys often retain sodium inappropriately nephrotic syndrome even glomerulonephritis evident
although classic formulation pathogenesis may accurate instances appears hypoalbuminemia commonly contributor rather sole cause edema
circulatory modifications result advanced cirrhosis complex
intrahepatic fibrosis raises sinusoidal pressures hepatic lymph consequently manufactured rapidly returned circulation ascites accumulates
simultaneously hepatic portal system capillary beds skin lungs intraabdominal viscera develop fistulas divert flow kidneys
acute liver inflammation present draws increased hepatic arterial flow
eventually tense ascites causes extrinsic compression inferior vena cava increasing capillary hydraulic pressure extremities
resulting transudation undoubtedly enhanced hypoalbuminemia
although inappropriate salt retention may occur early course cirrhosis combined hemodynamic sequelae deprive kidneys blood flow disease progresses avid sodium retention follows
extreme result disturbances hepatorenal syndrome rising serum creatinine virtually complete conservation filtered sodium associated massive sequestration fluid interstitial beds body cavities
edematous extremities painful
prone stasis induced ulceration infection occasionally eczematous dermatitis develops
patient supine mobilization interstitial fluid legs leads paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea nocturia
sequelae edema thus obligate physician reduce diuretics possible therapies specific underlying conditions
skill continued surveillance often required achieve objective maintaining adequate arterial perfusion
occasionally goals mutually incompatible
least two reasons every case edema must satisfactorily explained
edema forming disorders constrictive pericarditis thyrotoxicosis beriberi curable
others congestive heart failure nephrotic syndrome cirrhosis appropriate treatment greatly reduces morbidity may succeed mobilizing edema resistant diuretics alone
