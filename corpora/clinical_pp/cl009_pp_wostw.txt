palpitation common unpleasant often alarming awareness heartbeats
may result increased conscious perception normal cardiac rhythm cardiac arrhythmia producing changes heart rate rhythm contraction pattern may reported skipping pounding fluttering similar sensation
history palpitations may provide information cardiac origin sensation type rhythm disturbance responsible clinical significance symptom
various terms may used describe sensation
range nonspecific cardiac awareness discrete episodes rapid beats
terms commonly used include skip beats racing pounding fluttering well numerous others
may reflect cardiac irregularity
fleeting sinking feeling may also described particularly common patients isolated extrasystoles may correspond post extrasystolic compensatory pause
report seeing chest move flutter may suggest chest wall muscle fasciculations
yet cases noncardiac vascular origin symptom may exist hypertension aortic regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation exaggerated pulsations arterial venous systems
cardiac origin suspected detailed history may provide clues type arrhythmia
single skips suggest isolated premature extrasystoles whereas abrupt onset termination rapid regular palpitations characterize paroxysmal supraventricular ventricular tachycardia
polyuria may follow paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation often described beats irregular rhythm strength whereas sinus tachycardia gradual onset offset regularly increasing decreasing heart rate
syncope following episode suggests sinus node dysfunction overdrive suppression normal pacemaker function bout atrial tachyarrhythmia
patients ventricular demand pacemakers palpitation may occur beginning andor ending demand pacing
examination may aided asking patient tap rhythm choose several cadences tapped physician
important recognize however diagnostic hints suggestive conclusive diagnosis depends electrocardiographic recordings symptomatic episode
history may likewise suggest pathophysiologic mechanism presumed arrhythmias
palpitations exercise particularly unconditioned patient emotional episodes may reflect normal sinus tachycardia patient coronary artery disease ventricular arrhythmia caused exercise induced myocardial ischemia may also suspected
regular slow beats rest night typically reflect heightened awareness normal cardiac rhythm anxious patient
examiner also seek precipitating factors systemic diseases may provide key understanding pathophysiology symptoms possible therapeutic approach
include emotional physical stress fatigue febrile illnesses thyrotoxicosis caffeine alcohol ingestion addition drug toxicity antiarrhythmic agents cardiac glycosides worsening underlying cardiac disease
family history arrhythmias may suggest preexcitation long q interval syndromes
complete history provide evidence clinical significance symptom underlying arrhythmia
history organic heart disease particularly important cardiac arrhythmias absence structural cardiac disease pose less risk life presence particularly ischemic heart disease cardiomyopathy
former case palpitations may represent inconvenient symptom managed reassurance whereas latter aggressive drug therapy prevent delay sudden cardiac death may mandatory
thus complete history chest pain dyspnea like becomes critical component history palpitation
associated histories syncope near syncope sought
palpitations patient syncope probably increase likelihood cardiac origin loss consciousness
palpitations immediately preceding syncope classic symptoms sick sinus syndrome
sensory mechanisms responsible palpitation unknown
general palpitations reflect changes cardiac rate rhythm changes contractility andor ventricular contraction pattern
case abnormal movement heart within chest felt
cases isolated extrasystoles augmented post extrasystolic beat may felt place addition premature beat
clinical perception changes highly variable
whereas patients aware virtually every premature ventricular beat others unaware complex atrial ventricular tachyarrhythmias
example ambulatory patients ventricular tachycardia studied winkle et al
asymptomatic
conversely many patients symptoms major significant rhythm disturbances
patients complaining palpitations monitored zeldis et al
normal rhythm symptomatic periods
certain conditions predispose symptoms
patients anxiety states particularly somatic anxiety often report symptoms
awareness heightened sedentary depressed patients reduced active happy persons
palpitations may also prominent certain cardiac disorders without arrhythmias
include hyperkinetic circulatory states e g brought anemia fever aortic mitral regurgitation patent ductus arteriosus septal defects
patients orthostatic hypotension commonly sense palpitations caused sinus tachycardia standing
palpitations significant markers underlying cardiac arrhythmia condition
type rhythm disturbance found clinical context occurs determine importance palpitations
symptom imply presence cardiac disease
thus assess meaning symptom requires electrocardiographic documentation cardiac rhythm symptomatic period complete evaluation cardiac status
former often requires prolonged periods electrocardiographic monitoring intermittency symptoms
thus ambulatory electrocardiographic holter monitoring provides laboratory tool diagnosis
history alone accurately predict type arrhythmia responsible
many symptoms occur without concomitant ecg changes
palpitations group reflect accentuated awareness normal heartbeats noncardiac sensation e g chest wall muscle fasciculation
significance symptom persons limited assessment predisposing psychological factors careful deliberate avoidance producing cardiac anxiety state
others documented arrhythmias however clinical relevance palpitation depend solely type rhythm type cardiac disease found
