loss control generally refers lack ability provide conscious limitation impulses behavior result overwhelming emotion
states agitation fighting screaming uncontrollable weeping often thought behavior illustrative loss control
involuntary immobility due extreme fear seen times life threatening catastrophes earthquakes tornadoes floods also form loss control
patients typically tremble appear desperately frightened
important physician use terms patient familiar
patients often refer states agitation times hysterical wild rage
immobility due extreme fear often described patients times state shock
patient asked describe episodes behavior
patient specifically asked whether episodes loss control resulted injury another person extensive property loss
investigation portion psychiatric database enables physician estimate likelihood future episodes loss control
especially important potential violent behavior
although true one predict accuracy fact person carry violent act clinicians use certain factors make judgments regarding likelihood violence
include
past behavior presence paranoid thinking use drugs alcohol presence psychosis exposure violent environment presence antisocial tendencies expression violent intentions
perhaps important factor judging potential violence patient past performance
general patients shown frequent loss control inflicted significant injuries others must regarded potential homicide
one case man repeatedly threatened wife beaten severely number occasions
frightened wife arrested numerous occasions
however leave
finally years killed
retrospect man given clear evidence homicidal potential murder could prevented stronger action taken control help wife separate
patients feel persecuted unable obtain redress fancied injustices likelihood taking violent measures correct situation heightened
one large study homicides associated drinking part murderer
drugs similarly associated violent outbursts
amphetamines especially prone stimulate outbursts violence
times psychedelic drugs lsd may cause terrifying illusions lead serious violence
use phencyclidine pcp also associated violence
patient poor contact reality increased danger misperception reality might lead violent activity
particularly true patient hearing voices commanding someone harmed
clinicians feel patients experienced extensive violence likely resort
includes patients subjected severe violence childhood reared situations violence regarded acceptable response difficulties
well known parents battered children usually physically abused childhood
exposure patients physical sexual abuse clearly many long term psychologic effects
carmen et al
found examination life experiences male female psychiatric patients almost half patients histories physical abuse sexual abuse
inquiry indicates presence exposure physician alert wide variety later psychiatric effects including anxiety disorders depression
general patients involved criminal activities show evidence antisocial personality disorder represent higher risk violence general population
times patients directly express intentions commit violence
patients angry behooves physician inquire whether considered violence solution problem
patient directly expresses intention committing violence expression taken seriously physician patient entire life situation carefully assessed appropriate measures times including involuntary hospitalizations carried
past years many studies done judge accuracy potential violence assessed
early studies emphasized difficulty predicting violence
studies pointing inaccuracies predictive diagnosis violence extrapolated groups inaccurate assumption one ever predict violence patient
recent research focused limitations early research improvements may possible predictive technology
even though violence committed people psychiatrically disturbed seeing physician anything might allow physician predict violence nevertheless important physician alert signs potential violence
statistically likely person commit murder member victim family
reading newspaper reports crime often leads erroneous impression mental patients commit many violent acts
one reason impression newspaper reporters seem invariably consider important person status current former mental patient reported person involved violent act
often crimes tend spectacular thus newsworthy homicides committed within family
physician regard mental patients highly prone violent acts
instead physician alert possibility violence patient shows characteristics described
physician convinced patient serious potential homicidal activity several courses action open
states physician arrange involuntary hospitalization patient observation diagnosis
involuntary hospitalization usually short time hours unless patient judged continuing evidence potential harm self others
latter case involuntary hospitalization maintained long necessary recovery
many instances however physician certain potential violence take strong measures
nevertheless clinician still proceed efforts prevent violence
one way warning family threatened persons possibility violence
family take precautions removing weapons separating patient
infrequently families ignore obvious signs danger unconscious desire believe otherwise
cases physician great assistance helping family understand need protect possible harm
following case illustrates physician must times take strong position dealing family members patient potentially violent order avert serious danger
large powerfully built year old boy brought treatment set neighbor house fire
periods psychotic decompensation subject outbursts rage would destroy furniture threaten family members
physician realized homicidal potential patient urged family remove weapons house
however parents believe patient would actually hurt family member refused move guns saying would interfere much hunting favorite sport
physician insisted something done protect family finally parents persuaded move ammunition hidden locked area
several months later patient became enraged one evening grabbed butcher knife attempted stab two brothers
fortunately father brothers able subdue without serious injury
afterward parents extremely appreciative expressed physician conviction would killed patient able obtain loaded gun episode
