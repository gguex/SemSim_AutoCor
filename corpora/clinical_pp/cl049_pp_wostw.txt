neurologic history one challenging satisfying components general history
data collected lead clinician anatomic localization etiologic considerations
general principles history taking given chapter relevant
clinician begins open ended questions ends specific ones
tailor history urgency situation circumstances competence patient
cross history essential many patientsfrom spouse family members associates bystanders
telephone often important instrument available
meticulous examination previous records also necessary
critical information often unsuspected present former clinician often found
examine every detail past record taking starting point belief looking every fact fresh light never accept previous conclusions face value
previous data frequently take new significance light occurred since
drug history essential patient neurologic problems
fact plastic bag containing patient medications might even considered one instruments used neurologic examination table
number frequent symptoms explored detail section summarized
episodic neurologic symptoms chapter include frequent chief complaints clinical medicine transient loss consciousness dizziness visual problems weakness paresthesias etc
underlying etiologies include seizures cardiac arrhythmias migraine attacks transient ischemic attacks due variety causes vestibular disease drug reactions metabolic problems hypoglycemia many others
complaints challenging often difficult give satisfaction patient sense accomplishment physician correct diagnosis reached
good starting point taking history ask patient know one attacks
patient recount symptom temporal sequence open ended fashion
next take symptom order occurrence ask patient describe one detail often symptoms mentioned previously remembered
pain sensory perversions chapter common chief complaints
pain localizes disease processes body accuracy virtually symptom
pain often fellow travelers associated symptoms provide valuable clues localization etiology
quintessential hallmark excellent clinician ability collect appropriate data regarding symptom pain ability analyze data properly
modify one osler famous statements know pain know medicine
