syncope sudden transient loss consciousness associated loss postural tone
blackout spells passing fainting terms occasionally used patients refer syncope associated loss consciousness
syncope must differentiated states altered consciousness cardiac arrest coma seizures vertigo dizziness lightheadedness presyncope
cardiac arrest sudden loss consciousness without spontaneous recovery requiring electrical pharmacologic cardioversion
coma generalized prolonged extreme depression cerebral function
epilepsy seizures generally characterized convulsions loss consciousness
postictal period prolonged seizure characterized drowsiness headache confusion neurologic symptoms
convulsions occur syncope generally unconsciousness lasted seconds longer tongue biting incontinence bowel bladder rare
vertigo dizziness lightheadedness presyncope characterized subjective sense motion feeling inability remain standing
symptoms accompanied loss consciousness thus readily distinguished syncope
detailed meticulous history essential determining whether patient syncopal episode state altered consciousness
furthermore history conjunction physical examination lead causes syncope define need diagnostic evaluation
study patients kapoor karpf wieand et al
approximately half diagnoses established initial history physical examination
central issue defining syncope whether loss consciousness occurred
physician rarely sees patient syncopal episode majority information regarding syncope retrospective
frequently witness episode may provide critical information
many patients use terms wooziness dizziness passing blackout falling
states considered syncope unless patient lost consciousness postural tone
causes loss consciousness also considered information regarding need cardiac resuscitation evidence seizure disorder e g aura tonic clonic movements onset postictal neurologic symptoms history prolonged loss consciousness e g coma sought

central pathophysiologic process causing loss consciousness patients syncope reduction cerebral blood flow
decrease cerebral blood flow may result one following general mechanisms see table peripheral circulatory collapse inadequate cardiac output obstruction cerebral blood flow causes
sudden extreme fall blood pressure resultant decrease cerebral perfusion lead syncope
common cause vasodepressor vasovagal syncope
micturition syncope defecation syncope cough syncope orthostatic hypotension vasodepressor variety carotid sinus syncope also fall category
vasodepressor syncope occurs response sudden emotional stress
sudden marked decline total peripheral vascular resistance primarily resulting decrease vascular resistance skeletal muscles although resistance reduced vascular areas renal mesentary cerebral beds
fall vascular resistance compensated increased cardiac output
micturition syncope defecation syncope probably similar mechanisms
least four important physiologic changes described sleep micturition may affect cardiovascular system leading micturition syncope
first sudden decompression bladder lead hypotension circulatory collapse
second blood pressure heart rate decrease sleep
third micturition may associated strong vagal stimulus leading bradycardia hypotension
finally valsalva maneuver may performed lead decline blood pressure
mechanism cough syncope poorly understood increased intrathoracic pressure caused prolonged valsalva maneuver considered
others noted rapid rise cerebrospinal fluid pressure leading decline cerebral blood flow
many drugs disease entities associated orthostatic hypotension table
patients orthostatic hvpotension may marked decline blood pressure cerebral perfusion upon standing
carotid sinus important control heart rate blood pressure reflex arch
afferent limb carotid sinus reflex begins specialized nervous receptors situated wall carotid sinus fusiform dilation internal carotid artery immediately carotid bifurcation
carotid sinus impulses transmitted via carotid sinus nerve nerve hering join glossopharyngeal nerve
communications ascend cardioinhibitory vasoniotor centers reticular formation brain
impulses hyperactive baroreceplors inhibit vasomotor center stimulate vagal center
former action leads vasodilation latter slows heart suppressing sinus node
three types responses carotid sinus stimulation described
cardioinhibitory manifested bradycardia asystole without hypotension
commonest response amounting carotid sinus hypersensitivity
inhibited atropine
vasodepressor reflex produces hypotension without bradycardia asystole
third response manifested cerebral symptoms without bradycardia hypotension
often response combination cardioinhibitory vasodepressor types
syncope may result inadequate cardiac output leading decreased cerebral blood flow
type syncope divided two categories caused obstruction outflow pump failure syncope due arrhythmias
syncope may result obstruction left ventricle outflow see table
patients aortic stenosis may present exertional syncope
mechanism exertional syncope thought fall peripheral vascular resistance exercise combination inability increase cardiac output appropriately
pulmonary hypertension may also present syncope related effort
circumstance limitation right ventricular outflow markedly inhibits cardiac output response increased peripheral demand
similar mechanism probably responsible syncope patients pulmonary stenosis
syncope associated effort strenuous exercise also observed patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
atrial myxomas may obstruct ventricular filling leading low cardiac output syncope
paroxysmal sustained bradyarrhythmias tachyarrhythmias also lead inadequate cardiac output hypertension syncope
patients severe diseases cerebral vasculature may develop syncope sudden decrease cerebral blood flow especially brainstem
events may occur emboli vertebrobasilar arterial system
embolic source may sclerotic plaque endocarditis prosthetic valves myxomatous material mitral valve prolapse even intracardiac thrombus tumors
syncope prominent feature vertebrobasilar system involved
thought reticular activating system controls consciousness ischemia region may lead drop attacks syncope
vascular diseases cerebral arteries may also present syncope sudden ischemia
diseases include cerebral vasculitis giant cell arteritis takayasu disease basilar artery migraine subclavian steal syndrome
diseases may present syncope include akinetic seizures hysterical reactions
addition large number patients cause syncope determined currently available techniques
patients syncope considered three general categories noncardiac cause cardiac cause syncope unknown origin
categorization important formulating diagnostic plan also prognostic significance patients cardiac cause syncope higher incidence sudden death mortality patients two groups
vasodepressor syncope occurs age groups although common younger patients rare elderly
vasodepressor syncope occurs response sudden emotional stress setting real threatened imagined injury
situations commonly leading vasodepressor syncope include pain sight blood instrumentation venipuncture
vasodepressor syncope occurs primarily standing position less frequently sitting position
patients usually experience several minutes prodromal symptoms including weakness pallor sweating nausea increased peristalsis yawning belching dimming vision followed loss consciousness associated hypotension sinus bradycardia

diagnosis arrhythmias cause syncope based egg prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring
prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring indicated patients cause syncope established initial history physical examination egg
following limitations recognized however
first poor correlation symptoms found monitoring concurrent egg findings
arrhythmias may excluded cause patient syncope monitoring concurrent rhythm disturbance
patients syncope monitoring however presumptions cause syncope frequently necessary prognostic importance sporadic nature arrhythmias
second optimal duration ecg monitoring determined
suggested patients continuously monitored symptoms occur impractical
third yield prolonged ecg monitoring variable commonly showing transient arrhythmias potential cause syncope patients
despite shortcomings prolonged ecg monitoring single useful diagnostic test evaluation patients syncope cause still known history physical examination ecg
study prolonged ecg monitoring yielded potential diagnosis patients kapoor karpf wieand et al
large number patients cause syncope may established despite thorough evaluation
least three possible reasons inability define cause syncope patients
first abnormalities causing syncope frequently episodic isolated events may found initial evaluation may become obvious follow
second diagnostic criteria may stringent
last patients evaluated syncopal event may recall details surrounding episode
witnesses present valuable observations lost cause syncope may apparent
patients diagnosis established periodically reevaluated new clues etiology syncope
patients recurrent episodes syncope unknown cause may require repeated evaluation extensive diagnostic testing
