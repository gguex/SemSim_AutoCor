reference ranges vary widely methodology commonly used method produces reference range iu per liter adult population
intraindividual variation alp activity shown vary considerably less interindividual variation included reference ranges
therefore comparison preestablished values method individual may useful reference
numerous methods utilizing different substrates reaction conditions applied measurement alp activity
heterogeneity methods presents problems comparing results different laboratories often compromises current application data previously reported literature
recent methodologic changes emphasized need standardization optimization assay
readily hydrolyzed self indicating substrates permit continuous monitoring optimized reaction conditions preferred
earlier methods bodansky king armstrong involved indirect quantitation reaction products obsolete
widely used reference method utilizes nitro phenyl phosphate readily hydrolyzed self indicating alp substrate introduced bessey lowry brock
reaction rate enhanced removal inhibitory phosphate optimizing divalent cation magnesium zinc concentrations
serum specimen choice although heparinized plasma used
chelating anticoagulants remove activator magnesium unacceptable
since hemoglobin may interfere spectrophotometrically vitro hemolysis avoided
assay within hours specimen colection recommended frozen specimens kept room temperature hours prior assay assure complete enzyme reactivation
human tissues contain alp kidney liver bone intestine reticuloendothelial tissue placenta particularly rich sources
enzymes derived different tissues share catalytic properties differ chemical physical characteristics
three genetically determined forms described intestinal placental liverbonekidneyreticuloendothelial
different molecular properties within isoenzyme groups probably result posttranslational modifications
various methods used separate organ specific isoforms
none entirely satisfactory particularly quantifying components liverbone isoenzyme group
alp activity normal adult serum derived predominantly hepatic osseous reticuloendothelial sources
physiologic bone growth children increases serum activity times levels observed adults
placental alp causes fold elevations second third trimesters normal pregnancy
serum enrichment intestinal isoenzyme may cause postprandial elevation particularly individuals blood groups b also secretors abh blood group substance
number functions proposed
location hepatic alp sinusoid membrane suggests involvement transport function
increased alp synthesis observed cholestasis increased bile acid concentration caused intrahepatic extrahepatic obstruction biliary tree
bone alp probably involved calcification perhaps hydrolyzing pyrophosphate inhibits mineralization
hypophosphatasia inherited disorder virtual absence bone alp isoenzyme histochemical evidence deficient bone calcification
intestinal isoenzyme appears function transport fatty acids calcium phosphate
majority sustained elevated alp levels associated disorders liver bone
therefore organ systems prime consideration differential diagnosis
variety primary secondary hepatic conditions may associated elevated serum alp levels
since production increased response cholestasis serum alp activity provides sensitive indicator obstructive space occupying lesions liver
latter includes neoplastic primary metastic infiltrative diseases granulomatous hepatitis
bilirubin excretion compromised extensive biliary obstruction diffuse hepatic cell disruption therefore differential elevation alp relative serum bilirubin provides early indicator obstructive space occupying conditions
hepatic cell lesions manifested hyperbilirubinemia dominant serum elevation parenchymal enzymes aminotransferases alp elevations may minimal
diseases bone associated increased serum alp restricted presence osteoblastic activity
elevations generally detectable prior roentgenographic abnormalities
neoplasms involving bone may associated marked serum elevations lesions incite osteoblastic reaction metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate
conversely osteolytic lesions occur within multiple myeloma associated increased serum alp activity
metabolic bone diseases usually associated serum enrichment bone isoenzyme include rickets osteomalacia paget disease
levels usually normal osteoporosis
increased serum activity may observed bone fractures rising week persisting months
elevated serum alp occurring neoplastic disease may due hepatic metastases bone metastases direct contribution neoplastic cells
isoenzymes physicochemical characteristics similar placental isoenzyme attributed ectopic production variety neoplasms apparently represents derepression normally repressed fetoplacental genes
clinically obscure elevations alp commonly observed multitest biochemical panels performed hospital populations
cellular distribution alp increased serum activity may caused wide variety disorders involving multiple organs
attempts define organ source isoenzyme study may met limited success technical limitations accurate measurement different isoenzymes contributing total serum alp activity currently possible
however presence intestinal placental isoenzyme may revealed selected methods
evaluation unexpectedly increased alp include following
exclude physiologic causes
patient pregnant actively growing child
observe presence clinical biochemical clues origin increased enzyme activity
increased serum bilirubin aminotransferase either aspartate alanine activity suggests hepatic rather bone origin
disproportionate elevation lactic dehydrogenase ldh relative transaminase usually suggests nonhepatobiliary multiorgan system disease
association elevated ldh hypercalcemia hyperuricemia suggests metastastic neoplastic disease
elevation transient observed various tissue reparative processes healing bone fractures passive congestion liver
measurement enzymes nucleotidase gamma glutamyltransferase may assist identifying hepatobiliary system source elevated alp since enzymes significantly present bone
nucleotidase highly specific less sensitive indicator hepatobiliary disease
gamma glutamyltransferase sensitive however exception absence bone placenta less specific indicator hepatobiliary disease alp
gamma glutamyltransferase ggt one broad group enzymes catalyze transfer amino acids one peptide another amino acid peptide
enzyme sometimes referred transpeptidase appropriately included amino acid transferase group
specifically catalyzes transfer gamma glutamyl group another acceptor
reference range commonly used methods iul males iul females
higher activity males probably caused high enzyme concentration prostatic tissue
self indicating substrates continuous reaction monitoring preferred
commonly gamma glutamyl para nitroanilide used substrate glyclyglycine acceptor
substrate residue para nitroaniline directly measured absorbance nm
recently proposed reference method utilizes carboxyl derivative gamma glutamyl para nitroanilide enhance substrate solubility higher levels activity observed substrate derivative
however laboratories use unsubstituted substrate established clinical laboratory experience
serum specimen choice hemoglobin may interfere spectrophotometrically hemolysis avoided
edta plasma acceptable anticoagulants heparin citrate oxalate may interfere reaction
high concentrations ggt found renal prostatic pancreatic hepatobiliary tissue smaller amounts found tissues except muscle
number physiologic functions suggested
involvement amino acid transport glutathione metabolism strongly indicated
enzyme activity observed serum electrophoretically heterogeneous however true isoenzyme forms defined fractionation clinical significance
hepatobiliary disease predominant source increased serum ggt activity
increases associated forms primary secondary hepatobiliary disorders
elevations moderate times reference diffuse hepatic cell injury due toxic infectious hepatitis
cholestasis due intrahepatic extrahepatic biliary obstruction causes higher serum levels times reference
increases occur earlier persist longer alp cholestatic disorders
since skeletal disease associated increased serum activity measurement ggt clinical value identifying source obscure alp elevations
levels children age year healthy pregnant women within usual adult reference range
elevated serum levels ggt also found alcoholics patients receiving certain drugs phenytoin phenobarbital
probably result microsomal induction enzyme activity
serum measurement used monitor alcoholic patients therapy abstinence alcohol associated decrease serum ggt activity
addition alcohol induced hepatic cell injury may cause significantly higher serum levels causes parenchymal disorders
elevated ggt activity also occurs patients acute chronic pancreatitis
prostatic adenocarcinoma may associated increased serum levels
therefore although increases absent skeletal diseases ggt activity considered highly specific indicator hepatobiliary disease
