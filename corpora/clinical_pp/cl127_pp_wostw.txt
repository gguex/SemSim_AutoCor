examination patients vertigo disequilibrium consists examination sensory structures hearing balance vision proprioception well central nervous system connections integrate sensory information produced structures
sense organs central connections evaluated stimulating one sensory systems arid observing measuring reflex response
clinical laboratory evaluations depend providing precisely defined stimulus observing precisely measuring response
chapter describe discuss evaluation conducted clinic bedside briefly describe tests require sophisticated laboratory
first observe patient overall appearance gait posture
patient undergoing acute labyrinthine attack pale sweaty unable stand walk tendency fall one direction another
standing may asymmetry posture gait leaning causing patient upper body inadvertently bump door frames
wobbling side side generally observed true labyrinthine attacks occur chronic disequilibrium bilateral loss vestibular function disorders central nervous system
also seen hysterics malingerers response centrally active drugs
abnormalities gait posture elicited patients milder problems reducing sensory information available orientation making task difficult
patient bring feet close together close eyes
observe leaning sway
made harder asking patient rock balls feet back heels trick sometimes used highway patrol examine central effects alcohol
consistent swaying leaning one direction sign asymmetric vestibular input suggests disease labyrinthine origin
swaying back forth due bilateral loss vestibular function disorders central connections central nervous system active drugs malingering hysteria
next examine ears
examine tympanic membrane pneumatic otoscope apply positive negative pressure determine tympanic membrane mobility
serous otitis media mobility greatly reduced
source disequilibrium particularly children
purulent discharge tympanic perforation white pearly masses behind tympanic membrane signs chronic otitis media cholesteatoma
debris pus present clean wax curette suction look perforations retraction pockets
retraction pockets common superior border tympanic membrane
evaluate hearing using hz tuning fork
normal hearing use hearing standard compare patient hearing
check hearing air conduction fork near ear canal bone conduction base fork applied mastoid bone

sensory hearing loss part labyrinthine disorder affecting hearing balance lesion internal auditory meatus brainstem
conductive hearing losses due chronic otitis media cholesteatoma
next evaluate vision eye using snellen chart reading card
ophthalmoscopic examination eye retina optic nerve
observing retinal features also look nystagmus slow eye movement one direction rapid return
examine eye movements four primary directions look nystagmus gaze direction
check visual fields confrontation
check cranial nerves particularly v facial sensation corneal reflex vii facial motion
check tremor limb ataxia past pointing rapid hand fine finger movements assess cerebellar function
minimal caloric test instilling cc ice water ear canal patient supine chin tucked toward chest degrees
observe nystagmus compare nystagmus responses stimulation sides
wait minutes tests ear
patients show signs ear disease neurologic impairment evaluation probably specialist indicated
patients disequilibrium vertigo laboratory tests provide accurate objective information labyrinthine eye tracking auditory visual somatosensory function
computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance scanning provide detailed anatomic information lesion inner ear mastoid cerebellopontine angle suspected
patients symptoms persist suspicion severe organic disease present unilateral loss hearing vestibular function signs central peripheral nervous system disease referral otolaryngologist neurotologist neurologist recommended
