regional local rheumatic symptoms nonarticular though monoarticular arthritis could considered regional
purposes discussion regional rheumatic disorder defined nonarticular rheumatism confined one limited number sites regions body
majority rheumatic complaints fit pattern
common sites regional rheumatic pain common disorders listed tables
situations becomes relatively apparent problem rheumatic regional nonarticular questions need asked
premorbid patterns usage exercise previous medical therapies current disability prior history regional rheumatism asked
general basic rheumatism history suffice four special situations serve exceptions rule
lumbar low back pain common regional rheumatic syndrome seen many physicians
many cases defy diagnosis common serious definable causes suggested history
neurologic symptoms lower extremities especially important case suspected herniated nucleus pulposus spinal stenosis
patterns leg radiation localized weakness sensory deficits addressed
young patient gradual onset lumbar pain arthritis ankylosing spondylitis considered
location affected joints especially sacroiliacs renders articular localization history physical examination difficult
sacroiliitis however typically causes pronounced morning stiffness pain usually partially relieved gentle lumbar motion
family history spondyloarthropathy contributes significantly diagnostic specificity symptoms
lumbar pain resulting disc bone infection usually associated fever
metastatic disease spine typically accompanied symptoms suggesting malignancy
vertebral compression fractures caused osteoporosis common causes back pain dietary menstrual histories may pertinent women symptom
trauma especially important address syndrome
medicolegal well diagnostic purposes interviewer must approach complaint lumbar pain compulsive thoroughness
myofascial pain table
common regional rheumatic disorder perhaps common
myofascial pain also prominent component widespread generalized rheumatic syndrome known fibromyalgia fibrositis
patients syndrome complain pain vicinity several trigger points listed table sense generalized regional disorder
also number symptoms help confirm diagnosis
include various patterns emotional distress disturbed sleep headaches subjective sensations swelling easy fatigability chronic tiredness
regional shoulder girdle pain older patients two important causes
cervical osteoarthritis attending osteophytic foraminal nerve root encroachment may result pain referred one shoulder girdles
inquire relationship pain head neck motion position ask specific neurologic symptoms arm head
polymyalgia rheumatica poorly understood disease usually occurs elderly caucasians
major symptom diffuse severe rheumatic pain tends predominate shoulder girdles
accompanying symptoms include fever malaise anorexia weight loss symptoms giant cell arteritis sometimes associated polymyalgia
symptoms giant cell arteritis include headache visual loss facial painparticularly claudication muscles masticationand manifestations central nervous system involvement
myalgia pain arising skeletal muscle tends localize well forms nonarticular rheumatism common primary rheumatic problem except perhaps instances apparent trauma overuse
severe regional myalgia suggests trauma less often local infection
generalized myalgia may result vigorous exercise rhabdomyolysis viral systemic infections connective tissue diseases systemic vasculitis
causes common regional rheumatic disorders pathogenetic mechanisms discussed chapter
cause lumbar pain never known diagnosable low back pain obviously variety causes
articular inflammation spondylitis tends result historically distinctive syndrome prominently rheumatic whereas recognized causes result syndrome fewer rheumatic features often referred mechanical
mechanical low back pain often associated intraspinal compression one lumbosacral nerve roots worsen back pain causing distal neurologic symptoms
compared many areas medicine basic science nonarticular rheumatism primitive state
serious disabling problems lumbar pain beginning attract research attention however future see precise correlations made symptoms specific anatomic derangements
little need said concerning significance regional rheumatic disorders
lumbar pain usually transient undiagnosable relatively trivial serious disorders also cause lumbar pain
history usually suggest serious causes
shoulder girdle pain elderly may also serious implications history usually points toward diagnoses
although destructive nature fibrositis lengthy difficult illness major indicators diagnosis obtained interview
otherwise nonarticular rheumatism tends regional transient easily treatable significant pain disability avoided early recognition appropriate therapy
