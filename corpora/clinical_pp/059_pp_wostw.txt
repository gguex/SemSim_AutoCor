function movements clear
voluntary target seeking rapid eye movements
instruct patient fixate alternately two targets examiner finger nose
test movements horizontal vertical oblique directions
patient rapidly change fixation one target
space targets widely
observe following

saccadic dysmetria note degree undershoot overshoot
occur small degree normal individuals widely spaced targets rapidly diminish repetitive refixations
abnormalities usually appreciated without much difficulty bedside
smooth tracking movements eye keep object interest centered retina
direct patient hold head still
hold small target eyes move back forth slow uniform velocity

several bedside tests used evaluate intactness vestibular system leigh zee
observe eyes testing fixation see
nystagmus indicates vestibular imbalance
vestibular nystagmus increased fixation removed
consequently note whether nystagmus present eyes closed palpate movements lids watch lids ripple eyes move
observe effect fixation ophthalmoscopy
watch optic disk patient fixates distant object eye
optic nerve head drifts cover eye note whether drift increases fixation removed
since optic disk lies behind center rotation actual direction drift opposite perceived
vestibular system related structures provide valuable information unconscious patient
doll head maneuver caloric testing used test intactness following structures labyrinths eighth nerve pontine lateral gaze centers sixth third nuclei medial longitudinal fasciculus mlf peripheral third sixth nerves
reasons testing twofold test intactness brainstem mechanisms gaze separate brainstem conjugate gaze dysfunction cortical conjugate gaze dysfunction
begin doll head maneuver
hold patient eyes open forcefully rotate head one side pausing briefly end point
normal response contraversive conjugate movements eyes eyes rotate left head rotated right
flex extend neck continuing observe eyes
normally eyes rotate upward flexion downward extension neck
results abnormal caloric test must done stronger stimulus
caloric test performed using ice cold warm Â°c water
using cold water usually convenient
first inspect tympanic membrane make sure normal
elevate patient head degrees horizontal semicircular canals stimulated
fill emesis basin ice add enough water cover ice
let water become ice cold draw syringe
conscious patient little
ml enough ml used unconscious patient order sure maximal stimulus delivered
attach catheter syringe gently inject water external canal period
minute
observe eyes minutes
normal conscious patient elicited nystagmus slow fast component
slow component toward side injection cold water
due brainstem mechanisms
initial slow drift followed compensatory corrective fast componentprobably higher originthat immediately jerks eyes back direction
warm water produces opposite effect slow component away side stimulation corrective fast component toward side stimulation
conscious patient effects two components balanced usually eyes remain midline
mnemonic direction fast phase nystagmus conscious patient cows cold opposite warm
unconscious patient normal brainstem vestibular system fast corrective component cold stimulation
since slow component one present deviation side cold stimulus
test described easily performed bedside method testing vestibular system

location point usually cm increases age
opticokinetic nystagmus okn another test measurement ocular movements
okn railway nystagmus elicited moving test objects slowly across field patient vision
natural example occurs train passenger watches telephone poles pass window
also termed fixation reflex
repetitive patterns tape drum satisfactory
eyes slowly follow object direction movement rapidly move opposite direction pick next object
pursuit system primarily tested
note regularity smoothness duration opticokinetic response
ocular motor system five neurologic control systems concerned separate movements
control systems exist purpose keeping images stationary retina
order accomplish eyes must first fixate object interest move conjugately object moves head moves

saccades fastest eye movements
word comes french saquer means flick reins horse refers flicking sail gust wind
purpose redirect line sight
highest example saccade occurs response voluntary command head still
function turn eyes fovea centered object interest
saccades coupled voluntary head movements
rudimentary saccades occur quick phase vestibular nystagmus passive rotation darkness
rapid eye movements occur rem sleep also forms saccades
movements common brainstem premotor circuits
authors restrict term saccade solely movements voluntary control
speed saccade directly proportional distance movement larger movement higher peak velocity
saccade accelerates rapidly reaching peak velocity halfway movement gently decelerates stop abruptly
usually small overshoot
saccades initiated purpose training fovea target clearly begin decision higher cortical centers
number calculations must made location target interest respect fovea location target respect head body size velocity saccade needed
mechanisms whereby nervous system converts visual sensory information saccades clear
attentional mechanisms parietal cortex visual information occipital cortex obviously involved

vestibular system consisting labyrinth vestibular nuclei produces compensatory movements keep fovea fixed target spite movement head
labyrinth embedded petrous bone contains two functional components
three semicircular canals lie right angles
sensory receptors ampulla canal respond linear acceleration
anatomic arrangement three perpendicular planes thus permits sensing angular acceleration along three axes
semicircular canal influences pair eye muscles example stimulating left horizontal canal produces contraction right lateral rectus muscle left medial rectus muscle giving conjugate right lateral gaze
concomitant relaxation antagonist muscles example right medial left lateral recti
utricle contains otoliths called hairs sensory cells stick gelatinous substance containing calcium carbonate crystals
receptors respond linear acceleration e g acceleratory forces gravity
central processes vestibular ganglion cells project topographically onto four main vestibular nuclei upper lateral medulla floor fourth ventricle
nuclei send efferent axons mlf brainstem nuclei cranial nerves iii iv vi fibers abundant cranial nerve nuclei produce horizontal arid rotatory movements eyes
vestibular neurons concerned horizontal eye movements project primarily contralateral horizontal abducens nucleus
abducens nucleus contains abducens motor neurons abducens interneurons
