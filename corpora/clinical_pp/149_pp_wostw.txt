infrequently patients note enlarged lymph nodes present chief complaint nodule swollen gland knot enlarged lymph nodes commonly patients recognize significantly enlarged lymph nodes lymphadenopathy discovered physician
since lymphadenopathy associated wide range disorders spanning relatively benign medical problems streptococcal pharyngitis life threatening diseases malignancies discovery enlarged nodes represents important physical finding demands systematic evaluation
searching lymph nodes one must gentle otherwise lymph nodes minimally enlarged embedded tissue may apparent
particular attention directed size shape consistency enlarged nodes
lymph nodes smooth relatively soft slightly enlarged may normal reveal hyperplasia biopsied
enlarged lymph nodes irregular shape rubbery hard consistency may infiltrated malignant cells
tender nodes suggestive inflammatory process
matted nodes nodes fixed underlying structures raise question malignancy infection freely movable nodes likely occur benign conditions
extent location lymphadenopathy important determining providing diagnostic clues cause lymphadenopathy
major lymph node chains evaluated systematic fashion
begin visual inspection area looking asymmetry erythema
palpate systematic fashion encompassing accessible lymph nodes
examination lymph nodes neck patient either sits stands facing examiner
examiner right hand explores left side patient neck left hand examiner explores right side patient neck
starting top neck going various cervical lymph node chains evaluated including preauricular posterior auricular occipital superior cervical posterior cervical submaxillary submental inferior deep cervical supraclavicular noted figure
absence generalized adenopathy enlargement specific cervical lymph node groups helpful diagnostically
example posterior auricular adenopathy suggests rubella whereas unilateral anterior auricular adenopathy associated lesions conjunctiva eyelids resultant oculoglandular syndrome seen trachoma tularemia cat scratch fever tuberculosis syphilis epidemic keratoconjunctivitis outbreaks adenovirus type pharyngoconjunctival fever
oropharyngeal dental infections also cause cervical adenopathy
bilateral cervical adenopathy also prominent tuberculosis coccidioidomycosis infectious mononucleosis toxoplasmosis sarcoid lymphomas leukemias
however unilateral cervical mass firm nontender always raise question undetected nasopharyngeal carcinoma
supraclavicular adenopathy almost always abnormal
part generalized lymphadenopathy suggestive primary malignancy either abdomen chest
right sided supraclavicular nodes drain parts lung mediastinum signals intrathoracic lesions particularly lung esophagus
left sided supraclavicular nodes carry eponym virchow nodes close thoracic duct often signal intra abdominal tumors particularly stomach ovaries testes kidneys
supraclavicular nodes sometimes deep seated often helpful patient perform valsalva maneuver order push cupola lung upward thereby bringing deep seated nodes accessible position palpation
supraclavicular adenopathy noted patient also closely examined hilar mediastinal adenopathy
although chest x ray computerized tomography often needed verify type lymphadenopathy dullness percussion manubrium sometimes suggestive anterior mediastinal mass mediastinal nodes
patient examined axillary adenopathy
patient may either sitting supine
patient arm supported one examiner hands held slightly flexed position adducted
examiner right hand used examine patient left axilla left hand right axilla shown figure
examiner fingers slightly cuffed reach high apex axilla possible
fingers brought slowly exerting gentle pressure thorax
maneuver repeated several times order examine lateral group medial group pectoral group axillary nodes
axillary adenopathy may part generalized process may localized secondary infection limb
local infection trauma causing adenopathy searched carefully
concomitant epitrochlear axillary supraclavicular adenopathy raise question cat scratch fever
female unilateral axillary nodes raise suspicion ipsilateral breast carcinoma
next patient evaluated possibility epitrochlear nodes
often nodes overlooked inadequate techniques employed examine
epitrochlear nodes best sought patient elbow flexed Â°
right epitrochlear area approached inserting examiner left hand behind patient elbow examiner right hand grasps right wrist patient supporting forearm figure b
fourth fifth finger fall medial epicondyle humerus fingers overlie area epitrochlear nodes usually found
examination left epitrochlear area reverse right
epitrochlear nodes usually enlarged secondary infections hand forearm
occasionally neoplastic processes present isolated epitrochlear adenopathy
enlarged epitrochlear nodes occur frequently mononucleosis
past epitrochlear lymphadenopathy considered diagnostically important sign secondary syphilis commonly due recurrent hand injury infections people manual labor
occasionally lymph nodes found vicinity umbilicus
nodes eponym node sister mary joseph signal significant intra abdominal lymphadenopathy usually associated malignant processes
inguinal region carefully evaluated significant lymphadenopathy
uncommon adults termed shotty nodes inguinal region
shotty nodes usually firm fixed less centimeter diameter
result recurrent infections insults feet legs
significantly enlarged tender nodes inguinal region part generalized lymphadenopathy suggest variety conditions including syphilis chancroid lymphogranuloma venereum
unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy usually response infection ipsilateral lower extremity
inguinal adenopathy also part systemic processes lymphoma leukemia
femoral adenopathy usually located femoral triangle area node cloquet
although femoral adenopathy also secondary chronic infection trauma much commonly pathologic significance inguinal adenopathy
occasionally lymphadenopathy found popliteal fossa
adenopathy part generalized process localized secondary infection trauma lower extremity
many important lymph node groups evaluated physical examination
whenever evidence generalized adenopathy groups evaluated carefully
hilar mediastinal adenopathy compromise regional structures superior vena cava trachea potentially cause life threatening complication
multiple lymph node groupings abdomen including mesenteric paraaortic celiac retrogastric
bulky abdominal adenopathy also compromise structures including ureters inferior vena cava cause complications renal failure
abdominal adenopathy usually evaluated computerized abdominal tomography gallium scanning ultrasonography lymphangiography
spleen part lymphatic system carefully evaluated patient lymphadenopathy present
lymph nodes gathered variety groupings throughout body
nodes represent integral part immunologic reticuloendothelial systems
individual lymph nodes consist lymphocytes clustered lymphoid follicles reticuloendothelial cells lining nodal sinuses
follicle contains germinal center populated rapidly proliferating b cells macrophages
germinal center surrounded densely packed small lymphocyte cells replicate slower rate
b cells function recognition response antigenic stimulation
b cells principal effector cells humoral arm immune system whereas cells principal effector cells cellular arm immune system
macrophages cells reticuloendothelial system also part immunologic system function phagocytosis cellular debris foreign substances viruses bacteria gained access node area drained
reticuloendothelial system also clears excess metabolites circulation
enlargement lymph nodes either localized generalized consequence several different pathologic mechanisms
lymphadenopathy may represent increase number size lymphoid follicles proliferation lymphocytes response new antigen
enlargement lymph nodes infiltration node cells normally present metastatic tumor leukemic cells
lymphadenopathy occur secondary unknown stimuli cause normal cells become transformed lymphoma cells proliferate autonomously
lymph nodes infiltrated polymorphonuclear cells condition called lymphadenitis lymph nodes infiltrated macrophages laden metabolites lipid storage diseases
given mechanisms lymph nodes enlarge clear differential diagnosis lymphadenopathy involves infectious processes immunologic conditions malignant processes storage diseases variety miscellaneous disorders table
information clinical history invaluable diagnostic management patient lymphadenopathy frequently leads accurate diagnosis without need extensive diagnostic testing
age patient quite important
dramatic enlargement lymph nodes lymphoid tissue adenoids tonsils often normal response variety relatively weak antigenic stimuli mild viral bacterial infections vaccinations infants children whereas adults antigens elicit generalized response
age difference expression lymphadenopathy importance warrant almost totally different diagnostic approach patients puberty
specific inquiries made drugs allergies animal exposures hobbies occupation
lymphadenopathy adverse response drugs allergies well recognized
exposure cats may raise question cat scratch fever patient presents unilateral lymphadenopathy extremity
enlarged nontender lymph nodes epitrochlear axillary femoral inguinal areas often seen patients occupations recurrent usually minor injuries extremities occur
generalized lymphadenopathy also occur patients chronic dermatologic disorders eczema
acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids suspected information must obtained concerning potential risk factors disorder sexual preference contact individuals disorder transfusion blood products etc
information must also obtained lymphadenopathy
tender painful nodes appear enlarge within days weeks often secondary inflammatory process area drained lymph nodes
occasionally patient tender rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy lymphoma leukemia
however slowly growing nontender nodes may indicative either local generalized malignancy
careful history must taken regarding constitutional symptoms including fever night sweats weight loss pruritus generalized malaise
symptoms associated either malignancies infectious processes tuberculosis hepatitis
specific symptoms cough may raise question tuberculosis fungal pulmonary infection history jaundice clay colored stools raise question hepatitis
usually diagnosis condition suggested history requires corroboration data physical examination appropriate laboratory tests lymph node biopsy
infectious processes localized response local abscess cellulitis
infection systemic nature lymphadenopathy also usually generalized tuberculosis brucellosis infectious mononucleosis hepatitis fungal infections toxoplasmosis
immunologic conditions cause lymphadenopathy secondary clearly identified antigens serum sickness response insect bite lymphadenopathy may secondary antigenic stimulation conditions antigen identified
examples latter include connective tissue disorders including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus
sarcoidosis another example immunologic process causes widespread lymphadenopathy although causative antigen yet identified
recently recognized viral hiv cause lymphadenopathy systemic infection causing severe immunologic deficiencies host
syndrome labeled aids complex
unexplained generalized adenopathy raise possibility aids aids related complex individual carefully evaluated possible risk factors
blood samples viral titers also obtained
invasion malignant cells cause either regional lymphadenopathy patients head neck tumors generalized lymphadenopathy patients disseminated carcinomatosis
lymphoma also result either regional generalized lymphadenopathy
generalized lymphadenopathy may also result variety conditions including gaucher disease graves disease addison disease
patients lymphadenopathy diagnosis made careful history physical examination appropriate testing including hematologic parameters serologic tests skin tests routine x rays
diagnostic work ups tests performed goal directed manner order evaluate specific hypotheses
specific diagnosis established appropriate evaluation infection suspected cautious observation appropriate cultures obtained may warranted
indiscriminant use antibiotics unsubstantiated infections encouraged
hand diagnosis established malignancy major concern biopsy lymph node appropriate done timely fashion
biopsy done adequate tissue obtained histologic examination appropriate cultures
occasionally one node may biopsied order determine appropriate diagnosis
occasionally nodes reveal nonspecific lymphoid hyperplasia whereas neighboring node harbor metastatic tumor
inadequate specimen obtained malignant disease may diagnosed
conclusion although differential diagnosis lymphadenopathy may broad sometimes initially confusing careful gathering data history physical appropriate laboratory tests resolve differential vast majority patients
