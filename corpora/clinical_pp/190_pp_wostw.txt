urinalysis examination urine certain physical properties solutes cells casts crystals organisms particulate matter
urinalysis easy cheap productive recommended part initial examination patients repeated clinically warranted
chapter focuses physician may minutes urine sample reagent strips microscope inquiring mind
analysis may lead sophisticated chemical immunologic bacteriologic studies
rationale technique urinalysis straightforward
nevertheless various circumstances may alter information obtained
example one surprised urine analyzed come patient named protein red cells added urine reached collection bottle
illicit treatment sample frequent may used attempt justify disability military discharge need hospitalization
interestingly temperature fresh urine checked may help diagnose factitious oral rectal fevers
sample obtained free skin epithelium bacteria glandular secretions skin salves hair lint talcum debris
rare circumstances may necessary sample passed observation assure source freedom exogenously introduced materials
ordinarily suitable sample may obtained male simply asking foreskin present pulled back initial part stream allowed pass toilet next ounce two collected last part stream discarded first
females care must taken separate labia urine collected similarly
menstrual flow tampon helps keep menstrual fluid mixing voided urine
utility cotton balls soaps scrubs cleanse meatal area dubious initial ml urine flow discarded generally adequate flush away meatal debris
sample examined freshindeed still warmto give best results
standing particulate matter sediments bacteria proliferate alter ph casts may dissolve crystals may lost
refrigeration may cause precipitation orange red crystals uric acid redissolved rewarming urine
approximately ml well mixed urine taken microscopic examination
urine alkaline ml dilute acetic acid help dissolve phosphates may obscure formed elements

specific gravity urine depends person state hydration integrity posterior pituitary renal tubules
normally urine leaving henle loop dilute relative plasma forced hydration may contain little mosmkg roughly equivalent specific gravity
specific gravity urine equals weight given volume urine divided weight equal volume water
urinometer used correction must made temperature exact results needed
added subtracted °c change calibration temperature recorded instrument
protein present large amounts common methods affected
convenient correction factor reagent strips
refractometers urinometers necessary subtract
every gdl protein urine accurate
glucose present large amounts reagent strips affected

values
suggest presence exogenous solutes mannitol iodinated contrast media
reagent strip method commonly available three principal components polymethylvinyl ethermaleic acid bromothymol blue buffers
specific gravity high pka polyelectrolyte decreased ph falls resulting color change indicator
highly buffered alkaline urine may therefore result factitiously low apparent specific gravity
urinary ph expression proton concentration urine
although number free protons excreted contributes trivial fraction approximately meq acid average person excretes daily free protons determine efficacy titratable acid mechanism ammonium excretion mechanism together account bulk excreted acid
urinary ph high proton acceptors urine non ionic diffusion nh tubular lumen relatively impeded
ph low phosphates solutes efficiently accept protons diffusion nh tubular lumen facilitated
normally urine acidified ph value
less
failure face systemic acidosis may indicate partial complete renal tubular acidosis
bacterial infection urea splitting organisms may produce elevated urinary ph fresh urine leukocytes bacteria elevated ph proteus species would suspected offending organism
bacteria split urea commonly responsible urinary tract infection
protein enters urine either altered glomerular permeability tubular damage
glomerular proteinuria always includes large component albumin
tubular proteinuria low molecular weight b microglobulin
reagent strip tests protein virtually completely specific albumin depend upon capacity protein change color acid base indicator constant ph maintained buffer strip section
contrast media tolbutamide tolmetin penicillin may give false positive readings heat acetic acid affect results reagent strip
alkaline urine may give false positive result reagent strip false negative result acid precipitation techniques
glucose normally present human urine small amounts
glucose usually detectable ketones ascorbic acid substances found urine may cause false negative results reagent strips even urinary glucose approaches clearly abnormal values near mgdl
copper reduction tests specific glucose may react hexoses pentose creatinine uric acid salicylates numerous agents
bacteria present glucose may consumed false negative could result testing urine fresh
hexokinase reagent strip used glucose concentrations mgdl morning urine fasting person correlate well urinary tract infection
large amounts urinary glucose suggest diabetes mellitus rarely renal glycosuria
ketone bodies appear urine consequence accelerated fat metabolism
b hydroxybutyric acid quantitatively greatest followed acetoacetic acid acetone
large amounts present fruity odor may detectable
commonly available tests ketone bodies depend development purple compound presence nitroprusside alkali
tests react acetone acetoacetic acid b hydroxybutyric acid
l dopa give false positive result nitroprusside based tests
ferric chloride method available gives false positive results l dopa salicylates
ketone bodies likely present urine adult diabetic ketoacidosis patient fasting
bilirubin urobilinogen appear urine abnormalities bilirubin metabolism liver function
albumin bound bilirubin indirect bilirubin water soluble appear urine
bilirubin conjugated glucuronic sulfuric acid water soluble appears urine amounts roughly correlated direct reacting serum bilirubin
presence conjugated bilirubin detectable amounts greater
mgdl enable one confidently distinguish hepatocellular obstructive jaundice commonly occur hyperbilirubinemia consequent hemolysis
reagent strips tablets may give false negative reaction urine contains ascorbic acid
phenothiazines may cause false positive reaction cases
conjugated bilirubin reaches bowel bacterial action produces urobilinogen reabsorbed portal circulation
increased production bilirubin decreased hepatic clearance urobilinogen portal circulation increase amount delivered kidney excreted urine
thus hemolysis hepatocellular dysfunction may increase urinary urobilinogen biliary obstruction decrease delivery conjugated bilirubin bowel thereby reducing production urobilinogen
antibiotics altering bowel flora may prevent production urobilinogen
two tests taken together help distinguish hemolysis hepatocellular disease biliary obstruction shown table
hemoglobin normally present urine
may appear intravascular hemolysis hemoglobin filtered urine red cells break apart within urinary tract liberating hemoglobin
myoglobin also causes reddish brown urine reacts reagent strip hemoglobin
typically serum urine red hemolysis likely molecular weight hemoglobin impedes filtration
serum normal color urine red myoglobin likely smaller size favors filtration
alternatively course clear serum red urine may represent bleeding within urinary tract
false negative reagent strip results may occur urine contains large amounts ascorbic acid
false positive results may seen povidone iodine solutions rinsed urine testing
reduction nitrate nitrite bacteria consequent color change solution reagent strip useful indicator bacteriuria positive taken seriously
negative result gives assurance significant infection present
urine may retained bladder long enough bacteria reduced nitrate invariably case urinary catheter place
moreover certain pathogens streptococcus faecalis reduce nitrate
patients hypokalemia hypercalcemia protein malnutrition polydipsia able concentrate urine appropriately
diuretics similarly impair concentrating ability especially kaliopenia develops
conditions must considered interpreting specific gravity two circumstances greatest use evaluation possible acute renal failure evaluation renal dysfunction distinguish glomerular tubulointerstitial disease
often said specific gravity
makes acute renal failure less likely true value spuriously elevated endogenous exogenous solutes
also said specific gravity tends elevated primary glomerular disease reduced tubulointerstitial disease value factors might elevate depress specific gravity present
reagent strips relied detect globulins light chains
combination negative strip result positive acid precipitation test would suggestive multiple myeloma
aging population practice may find productive use methods
similarly reagent strips depended detect sugars glucose urine
may drawback pediatric screening circumstances inborn errors metabolism may cause sugars appear urine
remember presence excess amounts ascorbic acid urine may affect three areas commonly used reagent strip detect glucose bilirubin hemoglobin
people commonly take large amounts ascorbic acid various reasons prudent inquire specifically interpreting reagent strip results
careful analysis sediment usually takes minutes patient examination area coverslip

inclusions cast red cells white cells permit conclusion cells originated within kidney
especially important consideration vasculitis pyelonephritis
degenerating cellular debris may form granular casts
hemoglobin myoglobin bilirubin may incorporated pigmented casts
lipiduria important finding association nephrotic syndrome
fat may appear urine free fat inclusions within oval fat body characteristically doubly birefringent cholesterol ester referred maltese cross cruciform emblem emblazoned shields tunics knights malta
lipiduria abnormal found strongly suggests either fat embolization kidneys nephrotic syndrome clinical context readily differentiate cases
finding lipiduria patient proteinuria edema permits one anticipate diagnosis nephrotic syndrome waiting laboratory quantify cholesterol serum albumin
useful look bacteria
urine truly fresh presence even one bacterium per oil immersion field unspun gram stained urine correlates reasonably well colony count greater colonies per ml wilson
controversy recent years whether microscopic urinalysis always necessary especially macroscopic urinalysis entirely negative
majority cases prove specific gravity macroscopic examination completely normal microscopic examination likewise normal
also false negative results estimated vary cases schumann greenberg szwed schaust
even special type reagent strip used sensitive leukocyte esterase
positive findings may missed shaw poon wong
routine reagent strips authors found false negative result rate
certainly one could delete microscopic examination patient signs symptoms hypertension renal disease
cases omitted one must accept missing positive findingsa loophole large physicians comfort
certain circumstances may warrant special stains adjunct routine urinalysis
suggested wright stain sediment may help distinguish glomerular lower tract sources hematuria chang
technically useful add drop albumin solution sediment obtain clear slides staining
glomerular lesions produce dysmorphic rbcs distal lesions produce cells similar seen peripheral blood
stains would done fresh urine hypotonic urine would lead cell lysis hypertonic urine pyknotic cells urine stood length time
staining technique may used search eosinophiluria allergic interstitial nephritis suspected
may helpful b lactam antibiotics non steroidal inflammatory drugs potentially toxic agents used
quantification eosinophils percentage total urinary white blood cells helpful
urinary white cells eosinophils interstitial nephritis likely
less eosinophils infection commonly cause corwin korbat schwartz
urine sediment may also reveal crystals parasites foreign bodies spermatozoa findings
assessment meaning findingsindeed assessment findings urinalysisdepends upon inquiring mind asks appropriate question
mind therefore important element informative urinalysis
best physician rather anyone else review macroscopic findings inspect sediment interpret results unique patient even physician physical examination rather depend upon technician report
