central visual acuity refers ability visual system discern fine distinctions environment measured printed projected visual stimuli
presence excellent visual acuity tells examiner ocular media clear image clearly focused retina afferent visual pathway functioning visual cortex appropriately interpreted signals received
measurement visual acuity sensitive test integrity visual system fulfills standard criteria good screening test minimal cost risk patient measurement performed quickly easily little examiner training high prevalence detectable abnormalities abnormalities often amenable treatment
goal testing central visual acuity determine best possible visual acuity eye
instances either standard printed snellen eye chart used patient feet away reading card reduced eye chart used inches cm
one eye time tested fellow eye occluded
distance spectacles used patient e glasses drive walk around worn testing
reduced visual acuity card used inches patient years age wear reading glasses bifocals glasses read
patient glasses available approximation best corrected visual acuity obtained use pinhole held close eye possible testing vision
waste time every patient read every letter visual acuity chart
much easier faster technique instruct patient read smallest line see
often result patient going right line reading correctly saving considerable time
patients particularly elderly require encouragement continue reading smaller letters initially giving
know letters small blurry guess could letters
encouragement often improve performance patients acuity testing
testing visual acuity feet possible practical near visual acuity card used

eye complex neurosensory organ functions discern patterns distinctions light stimuli via optic nerves tracts transfer distinctions visual cortex interpretive centers brain
light energy transformed neural impulses retinal photoreceptors rods cones within retina information processing begun
fovea density cones sufficient allow excellent central visual acuity
following intraretinal information processing impulses transmitted ganglion cells coalesce form optic nerve
visual information transferred via lateral geniculate bodies occipital cortex patterns may interpreted integrated create picture world
primacy vision among senses highlighted comparison neural input different sensory organs cochlear division acoustic nerve contains approximately neurons optic nerve

order central visual acuity approach normal range several conditions must met
light rays must properly refracted cornea crystalline lens clearly focused upon healthy foveal region retina neurally transmitted occipital cortex
fundamental mechanisms central visual loss therefore twofold optical properties eye altered cause loss distortion light path retina retina diseased neural pathways cortical reception defective
pinhole used minimize incorrect refraction light resulting poor visual acuity
pinhole placed front eye tested excludes improperly refracted rays light permits central unrefracted rays light reach macula thereby minimizing adverse effect refractive error visual acuity testing
thus improper refraction amenable spectacle correction often implicated excluded cause poor vision use pinhole
number excellent reasons determining central visual acuity eye performing ocular examination
biological central visual acuity thought vital sign ocular function
stated previously visual acuity found great deal information obtained eye properly refracted ocular media clear foveal region retina functioning optic nerve visual cortex generally intact
taken together confrontation visual field testing pupillary function measured level visual acuity used corroborate question patient complaint decreased visual acuity
determination bright light light perception highly significant even acute setting usually denotes total irreversible visual loss
functional visual acuity worse frequently associated difficulty reading small print
state laws differ visual acuity better least one eye generally required driving automobile
visual acuity worse better seeing eye frequently used parameter determining legal blindness
ability count fingers lost patient longer able ambulate efficiently safely
legal examining patient ocular complaint especially emergency setting testing recording visual acuity ophthalmic examination treatment imperative
visual acuity recorded setting prevent future ambiguity regarding time cause visual loss
