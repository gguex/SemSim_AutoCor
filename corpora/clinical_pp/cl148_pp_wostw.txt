pica often involves disruption daily activities awakening night eat surreptitious behavior questioning family member may necessary
cases however embarrassment patient makes convenient successful interview patient
pica identified information relayed patient
instance treatment iron deficiency begun pica resolves rapidly often within days

also persons pica often crave object iron deficiency occurs
understanding pica means may indicate patient investigation necessary craving return
pica children different technique eliciting information directed parent rather child
close questioning eating habits especially related mouthing activities done explicit questions examples may necessary
four major circumstances eating behavior considered pica
circumstances disparate enough reduce likelihood one underlying abnormality accounts pica
general sense disorder originates either behavioral biochemical sources
somewhat loose use term pica though makes difficult generalize contributes lack embracing hypothesis
mentally disturbed retarded person may impulsively ingest available object suffering medical consequences thereof
persons obsessive personality disorder may fixate ingestion activity
persons behavioral abnormalities ingestion activity pica choice disordered mind response biochemical deficiency
mouthing activity children least part learning behavior may represent pica
children seem derive much tactile information inserting objects mouth touching fingers
discovery process unfortunately adverse medical consequences highlighted problem lead poisoning
ingestion paint chips plaster may originate innocent mouthing activity develop true pica perhaps due semisweet taste lead based paints
investigators believe pica childhood significance adults
point fact many milk fed children become iron deficient contend compulsive drinking milk eating paint chips dirt reflects poorly understood craving adults
third important circumstance pica found compulsive ingestion dirt clay practiced rural south migrants region
geophagia seems originated ethnic cultural habit passed mother child
children sexes learn behavior toddlers generally outgrow activity years later
daughters however introduced behavior years later often first pregnancy
pregnancy time many women iron deficient behavior seems widespread enough deficiency complete explanation
geophagia manages persist even migration
older black women midwest recall sent shoeboxes filled clay relatives deep south
fact clay certain sites highly regarded taste clay substitute sites quickly spotted
recent years geophagia may replaced amylophagia starch eating considered sanitary
although many women pica may nutritionally deficient bulk evidence suggests ethnic cultural practice explanation vermeer frate
majority pica seen physicians western countries traced iron deficiency without anemia
fact pica may detected many persons iron deficiency
crosby prominent proponent idea pica manifestation lack iron stores anemia
points pica common anemias
pica also disappears cases iron replacement begins long anemia corrected
wryly notes cases choice material ingested rarely good source missing mineral
pica occur important iron deficiency develops
hence pica may seen whether person chronic gastrointestinal bleed menorrhagia inadequate diet causes iron loss
good explanation however eating behavior manifestation iron deficiency
true mineral found important enzyme systems involving taste digestion
way perhaps deficiency iron enzymes could induce iron seeking behavior
entirely different explanation relates observation certain lesions brain may result hyperphagia
noted sites high iron content
extrapolation lack iron sites induces hyperphagia iron seeking pica manifestation
hypothesis never put experimental trial
pica necessarily manifestation iron deficiency
zinc deficiency also noted cause pica unreasonable suspect minerals may implicated
clinical significance pica separates three areas
first importance underlying disorder leads pica
public mind common pica could craving certain food e g pickles occasionally occurs pregnancy
may truly reflect iron deficiency cases significance unclear
fact country common pica adults probably associated iron deficiency
noted cause iron deficiency related development pica diagnostic investigation cause important
another clinical concern consequence ingesting whatever material chosen satisfy pica
virtually object may chosen
table
lists materials term coined entered medical literature
actually list materials chosen could never complete would least include peanuts potato chips carrots parsley lettuce toast mint leaves celery peanut butter raw potatoes orange peel tomato seeds coffee grounds baking soda charcoalsoot mortar tire inner tubes sawdust
list would worthy little astonishment important medical consequences chosen object
instance pica toilet bowl fresheners mothballs resulted hemolytic anemia
geophagia caused intestinal obstruction perforation premature labor pregnant women
certain fruits hair result bezoars
pica paper tissue boxes cigarette packages resulted mercury poisoning
clay ingestion suggested cause hyperkalemia renal failure hypokalemia cases
less bizarre common level amylophagia cause obesity failing provide appropriate nutrition pregnancy
summary serious consequences pica recognition treatment imperative
finally many people pica realize engaging unusual behavior embarrassed ashamed
people may subjects ridicule family friends gone great lengths hide compulsion
