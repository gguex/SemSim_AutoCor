vaginal discharge may subjective complaint objective finding
patients may complain excessive secretions abnormally colored textured secretions malodorous secretions
absence complaint examiner may note abnormal secretions asymptomatic patient
term vaginal discharge often used patients refer genital discomfort
complaint must verified physical laboratory examination differentiate abnormal physiologic discharge determine diagnosis treatment
eliciting cause vaginal discharge requires good gynecologic history particular attention following details
woman age last menstrual period regularity timing cycles obtained
hormone status pre postmenopausal must known
ask birth control method necessary used
yeast infections often occur menses trichomonas
gonorrhea ascends upper tract postmenses
postmenopausal women less likely yeast likely noninfectious causes
pregnancy birth control pills predispose yeast infections
ask discharge acute chronic frequently recurrent
discharges patients claim never go away likely bacterial vaginosis pathologic simply physiologic discharges
ask specifically pruritus internal dysuria felt inside body external dysuria felt labia dyspareunia irritation offensive odor
internal dysuria suggests urinary infection gonorrhea chlamydia
external dysuria suggests vulvovaginal irritation secondary burn urine
candida intensely pruritic trichomonas less bacterial vaginosis rarely
trichomonas bacterial vaginosis cause dysuria usually external
bacterial vaginosis fishy odor trichomonas foul one
intense inflammatory reaction yeast trichomonas cause dyspareunia
herpes cause intense external dysuria pruritus
attempt characterize discharge color consistency
color may white gray yellow brown mixed blood
consistency may mucoid thin thick frothy cheesy
yeast often like cottage cheese
bacterial vaginosis often grayish white nonhomogeneous
color consistency alone make diagnosis however
presence fever abdominal pain must sought
present think gonorrhea chlamydia upper genital tract infection urinary tract infection
primary herpes also cause fever malaise
vaginitis systemic symptoms
sexually transmitted diseases important know sex patient sexual partners number partners recent change partners whether partners symptoms
vulvovaginal candidiasis trichomonas bacterial vaginosis herpes transmitted lesbian partners gonorrhea rarely
prevalence various sexually transmitted diseases varies depending population studied emergency room office based practice sexually transmitted disease clinic
elicit history douching home remedies counter remedies leftover treatments past infections
hygiene practices frequent douching commercial douches scrubbing genitals cause irritant dermatitis may primary secondary cause presenting problem
recent medication use may alter physical laboratory examination
many patients believe vaginitis yeast infections use term generically
despite adequate treatment bacterial vaginosis yeast often recurrent women eloquently tell exactly
good history underlying medical conditions particularly predispose candidiasis important
recent antibiotic usage conditions penicillin prescribed dentist sought
comprehensive pelvic examination necessary accurate diagnosis vaginal discharge see chapter
particular attention directed looking herpetic vesicles contact dermatitis external genitalia
vaginal walls checked erythema coating discharge
look mucopus endocervix cleaning ectocervix swab inserting small sterile swab endocervix noting presence yellow pus swab
bimanual examination done
appropriate laboratory specimens obtained see chapter
diagnosis treatment vaginal discharge history correlates poorly objective clinical findings
effective diagnosis must include physical examination office laboratory procedures
clinician must determine woman physiologic discharge vulvovaginal infection cervicitis upper genital tract infection
normal genital secretions mixture transudate mucous membranes secretions glandular structures desquamated vaginal epithelial cells
amount consistency cervical secretions desquamation epithelial cells hormone dependent may increase ovulation premenstrually pregnancy use oral contraceptives
normal discharge asymptomatic except occasional complaints excessive secretions
physiologic discharge usually clear white nonadherent vaginal wall pooled posterior fornix
appear nonhomogenous clumps desquamated epithelial cells
ph less offensive odor abundance epithelial cells saline microscopy
women copious amounts desquamated cells otherwise asymptomatic often present frequently recurrent vaginal discharge
major causes abnormal vaginal discharge either vaginal cervical infections
causes vaginal infections gardnerella vaginalis trichomonas vaginalis candida albicans
primary cervical infections causing vaginal discharge neisseria gonorrhoeae chlamydia trachomatis herpes simplex
prepubertal girl n
gonorrhoeae causes vaginal rather cervical infection
noninfectious causes vaginal discharge include atrophic vaginitis foreign body malignancy contact dermatitis mechanical chemical irritation
intrauterine contraceptive device sometimes cause vaginal discharge related chronic irritant cervicitis endometritis
bacterial vaginosis diagnosis women presenting office practices vaginitis
formerly called haemophilus vaginitis often called unfortunate misnomer nonspecific vaginitis
recently called gardnerella associated organism
gardnerella short gram negative variable bacillus may colonizer vagina
controversial whether gardnerella produces signs symptoms disease whether symbiotic relationship vaginal anaerobes necessary produce characteristic gray homogeneous malodorous discharge
disease limited sexually active women clear evidence sexual transmission lacking need treatment partners unclear
diagnosis made laboratory methods
see chapter criteria
candida vaginitis yeast occurs less frequently patients physicians believe
one group self referred women offered part study chronic recurrent yeast infections found candida vaginitis
occurs offending pathogen usually candida albicans
controversial whether normal colonizer vagina
pathogenicity related concentration vagina small amounts cause excruciating symptoms
normal bacterial colonization thought important defense candida infection example lactobacilli inhibit growth candida
however women candida still predominant lactobacilli gram stain vaginal fluid
belief efficacy lactobacilli led home remedy yogurt containing lactobacillus used intravaginally applicator douche treatment vaginitis
sexual transmission proven important cases although treating male partners may help recalcitrant cases
host factors e g recent antibiotic treatment pregnancy oral contraceptives predispose yeast infection
known pregnancy use oral contraceptive pills predispose yeast infection
diabetes mellitus control facilitates yeast growth vagina women recurrent yeast diabetes
women diabetes risk forms sexually transmitted diseases must examined treated appropriately
women seem particularly predisposed recurrent candida vaginitis without apparent reason causing considerable morbidity expense
whether due gastrointestinal tract colonization deep vaginal wall penetration candida factors known leaves frustrating problem patient clinician
candida vaginitis characteristic history vaginitides pruritus prominent symptom often sparse discharge
discharge present may resemble cottage cheese
erythema swelling vulva vaginal walls marked
diagnosis suggested history confirmed physical examination potassium hydroxide preparation culture
trichomonas vaginalis flagellated protozoan grows well ph
role sexually transmitted organism well established
however common organism often found asymptomatically sexually inactive postmenopausal women
associated sexually transmitted diseases especially gonorrhea
trichomonas infects squamous columnar epithelium
urethra skene glands often involved explaining need systemic rather local therapy
ectocervix may involved punctate hemorrhages producing typical strawberry cervix seen time
discharge may gray greenish yellow usually frothy usually excessive
trichomonas induces polymorphonuclear leukocyte response easily seen wet mount preparations
diagnosis made wet mount
occasionally wet mount examination vaginal discharge yields white blood cells evidence trichomonas mucopus cervix
women usually low risk sexually transmitted diseases
cervical ectopy inflammation rather infection may cause
cause condition known usual sources vaginitis looked
misuse term nonspecific vaginitis probably best call simply inflammatory vaginitis
counter douches scented toilet paper contraceptive products common etiologies local irritation contact dermatitis
forgotten diaphragms tampons must looked malodorous discharges
postmenopausal women atrophic vaginal mucosa may develop watery irritating sometimes malodorous discharge secondary local irritation especially intercourse
may mixed blood mistaken postmenopausal bleeding
cervicitis poorly defined term used refer variety conditions including pathologic diagnosis cervical ectopy true cervical infection
hoped expanded interest sexually transmitted diseases lead precise criteria use
present important infectious cervical pathogens produce vaginal discharge include n
gonorrhoeae c
trachomatis herpes simplex
objective criteria developed diagnosis mucopurulent cervicitis see chapter
women mucopurulent cervicitis gonorrhea chlamydia
pathogens cervix upper female genital tract well urethra require systemic treatment
vaginal discharge occasionally presenting symptom serious systemic illness diabetes mellitus endometrial cancer major significance lies discomfort suffering women
vaginal discharge one twenty five common reasons visits primary care offices represents even greater proportion visits gynecologic offices sexually transmitted disease clinics
morbidity includes pain time lost work sexual unhappiness family disruption sexual transmission disease systemic illness infertility
vaginal discharge common symptom variety diseases distinct treatment
incorrect diagnosis medical social consequences
correctly identified normal women physiologic discharge may present frequently treatment vaginitis
sexually transmitted infections recur partners treated appropriately patients counseled appropriately
upper genital tract spread occur c
trachomatis n
gonorrhoeae leading systemic illness hospitalization chronic disease
iatrogenic vulvovaginal candidiasis seen especially young women antibiotics prescribed reasons common problem avoided appropriate forethought prescription
unrecognized herpes simplex vulvovaginal candidiasis gonococcal infection time delivery cause illness neonate
repeated doctor visits increased health care costs result incorrect diagnoses treated telephone without laboratory examinations
incidence sexually transmitted disease increase
one hopes new physician interest research problem vaginitis lead better diagnosis treatment
