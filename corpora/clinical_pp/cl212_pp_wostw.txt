chapter provide encyclopedic treatment allergic drug reactions
instead problem solving framework examples provided assist reader understanding anticipating diagnosing preventing reactions
addressing objective important deal widely held misconceptions
adverse drug reactions regarded nuisance events occasionally complicate patient management
roses without thorns adrs inevitable consequence therapeutic intervention drugs
united states hospitalizations per year result adrs estimated cost thousands millions dollars
great majority adrs pharmacologic allergic nature follow dictates pharmacologic doseresponse curves higher dose greater various effects
achieving pharmacologic effects drug neutral decide desirable undesirable
term allergic reacting misleading suggests almost magical process
reality biochemistry immunologic processes arranged provide exponential amplification response exemplified mast cell degranulation complement cascade release lymphokines lymphocytes
immune amplification clearly necessary dealing challenge rapidly self replicating antigens e g viruses bacteria tumor cells unchecked threaten take physical space occupied body host animal
unfortunately responses initiate inflammatory reactions injurious tissues
term antigen allowed conceal fact antigens merely chemical entities however complex may
thus given universality biochemistry surprising immunologic amplification occasionally initiated molecules mimic immunologic mediators share chemical configuration antigens andor antibodies
example histamine release mast cells normally mediated cross linking bivalent antigen ige molecules previously adhered surface cell
effect initiated iodine containing radiopaque contrast media opiates
similarly lymphokines released lymphocytes exposure nonspecific plant extracts lectins concanavalin
well known gastrointestinal intolerance beans gluten enteropathy may mediated nonspecific e nonantigenic triggering immunologic amplification
light long debated difference gastrointestinal allergy versus intolerance foods drugs becomes less confusing
still convenient gell coombs classification hypersensitivity reactions four types iv conceptually outmoded division immune responses humoral cell mediated
antibodies produced b lymphocytes lymphokines lymphocytes immunologic reactions sense cell mediated
table
attempt reconcile older classifications meaningful functional form
example possible points interaction drug immune system allergic reactions penicillin mediated via reaction types ii iii iv
important distinguish emerging classification difference chemistry immunologic amplification response antigen chemistry tissue hyperreactivity end products amplification
example patient allergic asthma probably must allergic antigen hyperreactive bronchi defined hyperreactivity intrabronchial challenge methacholine
soon double requirement appreciated clinical confusion allergic reactions vanishes
also follows concept immunologic event may occur one anatomic site hyperreactive organ another
example recent study shown cases migraine precipitated food ingestion offending food led increased ige containing immune complexes
case immunologic amplification occurred gut hyperreactive target organ cerebral blood vessels
occurrence migraine appearance immune complexes blood could prevented oral cromoglycolate
discussion relates immunologic reactions directed drugs metabolites
also obvious drug chemical nature alter host tissues become antigenic elicit autoimmune reaction via mechanisms described table
one example includes procainamide induced systemic lupus erythematosus sle due alteration components cell nucleus antinuclear antibodies appear antibodies native dna
conclusion conceptual sequence immunologic initiation specific nonspecific means leading inappropriate immunologic amplification followed inappropriate tissue reactivity provides rational framework understanding allergic events

dangers documenting drug allergy readministration drug great deal attention usually unsuccessful devoted development less hazardous tests
basis approaching problem figure
illustrates points drugs may act order invoke processes immune amplification tissue reactivity
diagram principles limitations tests drug allergy self evident
first although administration drug may give rise allergic event may metabolite drug actually responsible e g penicilloyl polylysine called major minor determinants penicillins
second immunologic responsiveness common hosts apart dealing rapidly self replicating antigens also involved clearing body foreign material
example mild local reaction pollens eyes may beneficial effect increasing flow exudate enhancing removal pollen
reaction strong enough produce clinically obvious inflammation patient declared allergic none event
third clinical allergic events may result initiation immune responses drug haptens autoantigens drug altered tissues also failure suppression e control immunologic amplification target organ hyperreactivity normal levels immunologic mediators
thus patient allergic asthma probably must two problems allergy antigen hyperreactivity bronchial mucosa smooth muscle end products immunologic amplification
follows drug hypersensitivity may result action drug one points sequence shown figure
unfortunately absence precise sequential kinetic studies causation various allergic reactions drugs makes extrapolation results tests vivo vitro problematic
thus drug degranulates mast cells releases lymphokines lymphocytes necessarily mean mechanism tissue damage
reason even positive immediate type delayed type iv skin reaction taken absolute evidence must interpreted context overall clinical picture
mind examine usefulness various tests vivo vitro
clear figure
way totally imitate alleged allergic reaction readminister drug brand formulation dose route
usually unjustifiable except unusual circumstances e g acute life threatening infections drug viable therapeutic option
absolutely necessary process undertaken beginning approximately dilutions usual therapeutic doses
epinephrine already drawn syringe means intubation tracheostomy life support available experienced hands
purpose small dose drug injected intradermally result read minutes
appearance inflammatory edema redness e wheal flare reactions follows drug induced degranulation mast cells skin result bridging two ige molecules divalent antigen
drugs molecular weight daltons usually antigenic far less antigenically divalent
exceptions high molecular weight agents horse antiserum vaccines containing egg protein e g influenza vaccine hormones insulin adrenocorticotrophic hormone pitressin dextran whole blood products local anesthetics diagnostic agents bromsulphthalein radiopaque contrast media
noted opiates e g codeine may release mast cell mediators directly e nonimmunologically thus producing positive skin test
low molecular weight drug reliably standardized immunologically mediated skin testing carried penicillin
penicillin becomes allergenic forming drug protein complexes
allergenic degradation products penicillin referred major frequently responsible minor less frequently responsible determinants
however minor determinants precipitate major clinical reactions
major determinant tested means synthetic penicilloyl polylysine pre pen cross links ige mast cell stimulate ige production e immunogenic
however reactions sensitized mast cells pre pen precipitate anaphylaxis
minor degradation determinants commercially available dilute concentrations newly reconstituted penicillin solutions old solutions reconstituted week substituted
see deswarte mellon et al
detailed protocols administration interpretation tests
principle testing begin intradermal prick testing using dilute e g unitsml solutions penicillin physiologic saline
negative proceed intradermal injections
ml penicilloyl polylysine minor determinants incremental concentrations
testing must take place epinephrine drawn syringe resuscitative measures endotracheal intubation even tracheostomy readily available
series green et al
results testing follows negative history penicillin allergy subjects yielded positive skin tests positive history positive reactions
illustrates patient recollections may reliable andor degree type immunologic reactivity may vary time
thus patients positive clinical history may take penicillin later without event
even dramatic unforgettable marker anaphylaxis penicillin used patients positive skin tests
corresponding figures prior urticaria rash also remarkably low
finally nine patients positive skin tests therapeutically challenged six reacted three immediate min accelerated hr reactions
patients negative skin test reactions treated penicillin fewer immediate ige reactions another reactions
thus negative skin test may indicate relatively low risk clinical reactivity
positive test indicates careful weighing therapeutic benefit risk ratio
types allergic reactions penicillins mediated igg igm e g hemolytic anemia interstitial nephritis described sections dealing specific organ involvement
types reactions predictable skin testing pre pen major minor determinants
similar approach applicable skin testing reactivity local anesthetics
drugs divided two groups depending possession e benzocaine procaine etc
absence e g dibucaine lidocaine para amino phenyl group
potential adverse effects may differ two groups
although mechanism effects clear type ige mediated effects probably rare
context appropriate note drugs different therapeutic classes may chemically allergenically similar
examples include use procainamide lidocaine cardiac dysrhythmias procaine penicillin therapy
occasionally one drugs may mandatory despite history prior reactions group drugs
careful history increased doses given intradermally beginning prick test working
ml volume undiluted material
case radiopaque contrast media urticarial bronchospastic angioedematous full blown anaphylactoid reactions initiated immunologically figure
thus skin testing value
consequently radiopaque contrast media examinations replaced means ct nucleotide scanning radiologic study undertaken premedication steroids antihistamines
guarantee freedom risk however administration radiopaque contrast medium must take place full resuscitative facilities available
similar situation exists case urticaria angioedema asthma induced aspirin skin testing aspiryl polylysine may discriminate reactors nonreactors may precipitate attack
attacks often associated presence nasal polyps pathognomonic aspirin sensitivity
aspirin reactions reliably ruled tests bronchial hyperreactivity following intrabronchial challenge histamine methacholine
context patient strong history aspirin avoided always bearing mind nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs also precipitate asthma
absolutely necessary oral challenge increasing doses aspirin beginning mg alternate days undertaken fractional expired volume second measured intervals hours ingestion challenge dose
similar process followed testing tartrazine dye sensitivity
theoretically delayed type hypersensitivity reaction involving lymphokine release sensitive lymphocytes appearing hours intradermal injection drug also good indicator prior expansion cell clones sensitive drug
practice however procedure gained wide spread use
also risk intradermal dose drug may sensitize patient
topical application drug sealed cover e patch testing associated uncertainties
addition interpretation patch testing complicated lack simple rules standardized doses occurrence false positive irritant responses due drug hyperirritable skin extremely high concentrations drug
thus although sometimes used detect allergy topically applied agents patch testing found place evaluating allergy systemically administered drugs
tests vitro avoid anaphylactic sensitizing hazards rechallenge skin testing vivo
ideally tests also give precise quantifiable result indicating type immunologic reaction table
place sequentially linked events leading clinical expression figure
ideals rarely realized however precise quantifiable kinetic experiments documenting existence events also timing sequence far
modern student immunology faced myriad phenomenologic events b cells helper cells suppressor cells immunoglobulin levels etc
yet linked meaningful kinetic sequences permit precise clinical correlation
thus although extensive lists empiric associations compiled clinical usefulness limited time
thus presence eosinophilia suggestive allergy providing causes ruled e g parasitic infections hodgkin disease periarteritis nodosa
also possible quantify total serum ige levels using prist paper disc radioimmunoassay technique assay
however meaningful interpretation test requires baseline antibody levels followed demonstration rise correlating allergic drug reaction subsequent decline
principle serologic diagnosis infectious diseases except time drug reaction occurs serum ige level usually already raised
consequently test often little value
also prist assay measures total ige ige specific drug responsible reaction
antigen specific ige measured semiquantifiably using rast radioallergosorbent assay
test yields results penicillin allergy correlate results skin testing
drug antigens available work system rast test available detecting minor determinants penicillins
another test may use future release histamine vitro following exposure basophils patient drug question
currently test available research tool
still true plasma whole blood histamine levels
tests use direct indirect coombs tests antibodies igg igm complement red cells
hemolysis red cells antibody complement also employed context
complement system evaluated measurement ch individual complement components
tests established research laboratory may come clinical application lymphokine production lymphocytes lymphocyte blastogenesis exposure antigen
lymphokine production test peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained patient exposed drug e g penicillin addition cell culture medium
supernatant culture medium examined presence lymphokines macrophage migration inhibitory factor
another measurable lymphocyte response initiation cell division requiring dna synthesis measured incorporation radiolabeled tritiated thymidine
drugs immunologic reactivity demonstrated means include nitrofurantoin antituberculous drugs phenytoin carbamazepine
apart technological difficulties make tests less routine clear examination figure
immunologic reactivity drug vitro necessarily imply immunopathologic role
conversely negative test one aspect immune reactivity exclude allergic reaction originating another point chain events
allergic drug reactions inevitably occur
therefore anticipated
patients given drug high allergic potential e g penicillin remain supervision least minutes administration
literature replete reports patients dying anaphylaxis minutes leaving doctor office
tissue injury mediated immunologic reactions drug drug particular drug usually implicated nature allergic events
consequently detailed often time consuming drug history linchpin diagnosis tests vivo vitro tertiary importance
nearly cases prevention avoidance realistic cure recurrences depends successful detailed education patient guardians physician
essence management allergic drug reactions lies three sequential steps anticipation diagnosis prevention
anticipation adverse drug reactions crucial three
hospitalized patients experience adverse drug reaction
fewer allergic nature
failure accept facts tantamount wishful thinking main reason many adverse effects pass unrecognized
hand anticipation places physician patient best possible position diagnose adverse effects earliest warning
best way incorporate practice formally discuss patient guardians risks intrinsic drug development adverse effects specifically looked
list might observed felt patient family given without unduly alarmist
development adverse effect anticipated discussed ahead time gives clearest possible signal patient competence physician events control however unpleasant may
enhanced patient physician bonding derives process one satisfying professional experiences
specific drugs available interrupt immunologic amplification sequence initiated
treatment therefore usually limited life supportive measures combined discontinuance drug administration antihistamines nonspecific anti inflammatory agents corticosteroids
reason considerable time often hours invested obtaining detailed drug history worthwhile
armed information intelligent strategy avoiding offending agent often constructed
may simple telling patient avoid single drug preparation however
example case tartrazine dye sensitivity list tartrazine containing drugs foods may given patient
case penicillin allergy penicillins avoided except life threatening situations therapeutic alternatives exist close supervision
potential cross reactivity patients history penicillin allergy given cephalosporins kept mind possibility cross reactivity among aminoglycosides
chemical relationship sulfa drugs e g sulfonamide antibiotics thiazide diuretics sulfonylureas also reemphasizes need careful documentation chemistry drug constituents
true caine family used local anesthetics cardiac antidysrhythmics
communicated articulated patient family understand ramifications problem
patients taught carry list potential offending agents take responsibility allergic diathesis confronting new physician possibility allergic reaction proposed drug
one final form prevention desensitization drug administration incremental doses starting extremely low levels
detailed protocols different drugs e g penicillin insulin found standard allergy texts
desensitization undertaken extreme situations enterococcal endocarditis urgent penicillin therapy may mandatory
ideally conducted intensive care setting equipment resuscitation continued life support physicians experienced procedures
desensitization applies type reactions immunologic mechanisms shown table
drugs employed human therapeutics molecular weights daltons antigenic linked covalently hapten large molecules e g cell membrane components proteins polysaccharides
mentioned drugs procainamide may alter nuclear components rendering immunogenic self resulting autoimmune disease resembling systemic lupus
cephalothin methyldopa mefenamic acid also alter red cell membrane immunoglobulins adhere nonspecifically
produces positive direct coomb test rarely hemolytic anemia
drugs given orally greater opportunity altered combined gut flora products absorption mechanisms metabolism liver
hand chase showed drugs given mouth could desensitize animal drug administration routes
clinical example may desensitization penicillin oral route
contrast topical application carries highest risk sensitization especially skin inflamed
particular hazard nurses administer drugs infrequently contaminate hands drug
factors genetic endowment race probably influence incidence type adrs concrete demonstrations
examples include greater risk adrs isoniazid hydralazine procainamide slow acetylators perhaps debrisoquine phenytoin slow hydroxylators
atopic patients whose problem seems involve intrinsic skin mucosal bronchial hyperreactivity overall increased risk drug allergy may actually less risk developing contact dermatitis
age patient may important inasmuch children fewer allergic reactions drugs possibly less prior exposure
older patients may fewer direct allergic reactions drugs autoimmune manifestations perhaps due reduction helper cell function
clearly risk allergic reaction increases prior exposure drug cross sensitization chemically related agents e g caine local anesthetics
approximately patients allergic penicillin allergic cephalosporins
patient allergic one penicillin considered allergic penicillins
general patients experienced one drug reaction twice risk approximately developing another probably applies allergic drug reactions
finally underlying disease influence development allergy
example patients hypo gammaglobulinemia fewer antibody related reactions patients sarcoid less cell reactivity
customary divide allergic drug reactions two clinical categories systemic local single organ involvement
said mechanisms clear allergic reactions systemic nature although specific organ damage e g asthma hypersensitivity pneumonia hepatitis easy visualization e g skin lesions may suggest dominant anatomic location

important note intradermal pre pen used test penicillin allergy also cause anaphylaxis
consequently testing undertaken without good reason certainly satisfy curiosity patient doctor

disease self limiting usually lasts week
drug fever infrequent event complicating confusing patient management

systemic vasculitis due immune complex disease may express hemorrhagic skin lesions purpura glomerulitis proteinuria hematuria arthralgias pulmonary infiltrates abdominal pain bleeding gut neuropathy etc
currently penicillins cephalosporins commonest cause drug fever
however causative drugs aminoglycosides phenytoin quinidine procainamide iodides methyldopa may encountered professional lifetime
drug induced sle first observed hydralazine since reported increasing number agents chief among procainamide
drug induced lupus syndrome many similarities naturally occurring disease e g fever arthralgias myalgia pleurisy anemia skin rashes

partial list commonly used drugs causing lupus given table
drugs shown procainamide powerful inducer antinuclear antibodies followed hydralazine
however minority patients antinuclear antibodies develop clinical sle risk increased slow acetylator
individuals desirable choose antihypertensives hydralazine
procainamide induced sle absence antibody native dna useful discriminator respect natural disease
drug induced sle common slow acetylators interest acetylated procainamide may less powerful inducer antinuclear antibodies
isoniazid induces antinuclear antibody production tuberculous patients receiving drug overt lupus rare

resistance insulin usually nonimmunologic may found disease states ketoacidosis acute infections decrease insulin receptors
immunologically mediated insulin resistance rare may due anti insulin receptor antibodies antibodies igg insulin
resistance usually occurs first months starting insulin
igg antibodies also mediate painful local reactions beginning hours subcutaneous injection insulin

ige antibodies also mediate early h local reactions urticaria even anaphylaxis
may particular risk insulin begun stopped period reinstituted
presumably continued daily administration insulin effectively desensitizes patient
reason patient seen soon h reaction insulin continued lower dosages hospital supervision dosage gradually increased

context remembered allergic reaction may due non insulin component injection e g protamine zinc
hopefully availability human insulin revolutionize prevention management types problems
probably largest organ body visible skin widely recognized
site allergic events
however reemphasized allergic reactions drugs nature systemic
also allergic reaction drug may involve one immunologic mechanisms shown table
corollary tissue damage mediated available inflammatory immunologic responses drug drug
thus many drugs produce clinical reactions vice versa
hence inspection skin lesions usually identify offending drug
achieved careful history
reasons exhaustive listings drugs clinical classifications reactions less useful might anticipated
examples given table
illustrate point
ampicillin induced maculopapular rash seems special case patients rash immunologically mediated may actually disappear despite continued therapy
also high percentage patients infectious mononucleosis develop rash given ampicillin fact may retrospect diagnostic test disease
cases maculopapular rash contact dermatitis however type iv reaction ampicillin implicated witnessed release lymphokines patient lymphocytes penicillin vitro
diagnostic principles described skin apply detection pulmonic allergic drug reactions
greater difficulty access lung tissue pathogenetic immunologic definitions reactions even less clear case skin
however number empiric associations made along putative mechanisms
division antigenic nonantigenic initiation failure regulation immune amplification tissue hyperreactivity kept mind
example last category propranolol induced bronchospasm due beta adrenergic blockade already hyperreactive bronchi asthmatic
given inhalation aerosols polymyxin b pituitary snuff cromolyn acetylcysteine also produced attacks asthma
whether effects represent irritation hyperreactive bronchi specific nonspecific initiation immunologic reactivity hard say individual case
bronchospastic reactions acetylcysteine cromolyn particular note drugs may used treatment asthma
also note asthma induced non steroidal anti inflammatory agents aspirin common indomethacin naproxen etc
agents seem disturb balance tonic bronchial constriction dilation interfering prostaglandin synthesis
reactions may frequent patients nasal polyps
finally always kept mind non drug constituent common many drug formations may cause asthma
classic example tartrazine dye used color many medications foods
several drugs associated appearance acute inflammatory infiltration lung parenchyma
phenomenon hypersensitivily pneumonia inhaled antigens well described context farmers lung bird fanciers lung etc
therefore surprising similar effects result drug administration inhalation e g bovine pituitary snuff replaced synthetic antidiuretic hormone
pulmonary infiltrates eosinophilia pie syndrome associated penicillins sulfonamides cromolyn
acute interstitial pneumonitis characterized dyspnea cough pleuritic pain fever occur nitrofurantoin
physical examination may reveal rales chest x ray may negative unless inflammatory process severe case cyanosis may appear lung function tests reveal restrictive pattern
eosinophilia may may present
process may begin anywhere hours several days nitrofurantoin started improves within days cessation recurs drug reintroduced
chronic type fibrotic infiltrate lung also observed nitrofurantoin
onset insidious begins months starting drug dyspnea cough cyanosis severe cases
drugs similar fibrosing effects include phenytoin carbamazepine bleomycin busulfan cyclophosphamide methysergide
methysergide also produce pleural retroperitoneal fibrosis
present debated immunologic events represent secondary fibrotic reaction oxidative injury tissues drugs
case methotrexate may initial acute granulomatous reaction suggestive immunologic reactivity
often subsides even methotrexate continued although process may go pulmonary fibrosis
drugs induce lupus syndrome also produce fibrosis e g hydralazine procainamide isoniazid
pharmacologic idiosyncratic drug reactions primaquin induced hemolysis glucose phosphate dehydrogenase gpd deficiency chloramphenicol induced aplastic anemia already alluded table
table
clear various cells blood targets immunologic attack like cell body although precise immunologic mechanism one disease may clear
commonly identified mechanisms type ii type iii reactions
type ii reactions drug binds cell hapten antibody adheres
type iii reaction drug binds serum protein antibody formed leading formation cytolytic antigen antibody complement complexes lyse cells happen come contact e innocent bystander reaction
examples include sedormid quinidine induced thrombocytopenia
list drugs causing type reaction long diagnosis made context thrombocytopenia associated drug administration followed literature search beginning manufacturer description drug
particular note thrombocytopenia induced heparin may complicate anticoagulant therapy
hemorrhagic features gastrointestinal bleeding hematuria purpura merely secondary thrombocytopenia offer specific diagnostic clues
laboratory tests complement fixation platelet factor iii release release chromium radiolabeled platelets used
however negative tests exclude diagnosis subsidiary diagnostic value history response withdrawal drug
rechallenge almost invariably unjustified
immunologically mediated lysis red cells e hemolytic anemia follows principles thrombocytopenia
thus adherence penicillin red cell hapten subsequent adsorption antibody type ii reaction may lead removal cell spleen less commonly complement lysis
direct coombs test may reveal igg adhering red cells
complement fixing immune complex e type iii reactions drugs quinidine sulfonamides may also occur
expected direct coombs test often detects complement red cell surface although coombs test immunoglobulin may negative
latter observation may indicate light binding immunoglobulin e g igm may hop red cell red cell activating cytolytic complement surface turn producing degree hemolysis proportion amount circulating antigen antibody complexes
patients positive coombs test actually develop hemolytic anemia however
another important drug induce hemolytic anemia methyldopa
mechanism controversial may involve alteration red cell membrane secondary development autoimmune antibody
alternatively methyldopa may alter existing igg adheres red cells
whichever mechanism applies positive coombs test develops one third patients first months therapy
minority patients actually develop hemolytic anemia however stopping drug usually necessary
similar phenomenon described l dopa
similar vein cephalosporin drugs alter red cell membrane serum proteins adhere direct coombs test becomes positive
hemolysis occur false agglutination may encountered cross matching blood transfusion
like penicillins cross reaction cephalosporins may also produce hapten type positive coombs test
agranulocytosis may result slow onset toxic effects drugs
rapid onset agranulocytosis via immunologic mechanisms e g type iii innocent bystander usually appears within days starting therapy
