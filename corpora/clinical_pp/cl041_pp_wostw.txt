objective obtain history information pertaining past pulmonary diseases especially chronic progressive recurrent may impact present future conditions
begin questioning general statements ever problems lungs
doctor ever told lung problems
already asked patient possible symptoms dyspnea wheezing cough hemoptysis possible predispositions smoking environmental inhalation goal elicit names past pulmonary diseases dates places treatment andor hospitalization possible existence additional past medical data especially places dates diagnostic studies chest roentgenograms
affirmative response questions usually takes one two forms l specific diagnosis emphysema pleurisy frequently mispronounced misunderstood patient hospitalized andor treated past suspicion patient may pulmonary disorder evaluation ever made
occasionally patient knows treated lung problem know remember specific diagnosis
specific diagnosis stated several things must determined
firm diagnosis
patient first seek treatment
dates places hospitalizations andor treatment
illness chronic recurrent one treatments followed past well present course disease impact disease andor treatment patient life
regarding firmness diagnosis specific disorder offered patient viewed skepticism
convey skepticism patient however might evoke defensive reaction could jeopardize rapport patient damage confidence patient personal physician previous care
examiner must especially wary diagnoses commonly misapplied misinterpreted
patients often told physician emphysema basis physical examination chest roentgenogram cigarette smoking history previous physician attempt frighten patient stopping smoking
important determine patient symptoms compatible diagnosis pulmonary function testing performed part evaluation patient clinical response treatment bronchodilators
similarly diagnosis asthma considered detail chapter often used patients type wheezing dyspnea
history tuberculosis tb could mean definite diagnosis pulmonary tuberculosis positive tuberculin skin test suspicion based abnormality chest roentgenogram
patients often told spot lung previous chest roentgenogram
could represent pseudo lesion transient density longer present unexplained roentgenographic density needs prompt evaluation stable density representing benign self limited granulomatous infectious disease needs confirmation obtaining previous chest roentgenogram comparison
another common past diagnosis pleurisy
diagnosis carelessly applied past noncardiac chest pains including musculoskeletal
patients state collapsed lung may spontaneous pneumothorax atelectasis without pneumothorax neither
inquiries include whether thoracostomy tube inserted whether bronchoscopy performed results
patient sometimes state underwent surgical removal growth spot tumor lung
next question doctor tell
specifically malignant
told cancer
amazingly patients often quite uninformed surgery past medical records obtained may tell entirely different story patient relates
totally impractical present patient long list possible pulmonary disorders along question ever
patient responds negatively initial question lung problems certain disorders mentioned specifically table
possibility tuberculosis following questions asked
ever told might tuberculosis tb
date place diagnosis whether diagnosis made basis sputum smear andor culture specific drugs length treatment success failure determined
ever tb skin test
dates results recorded
ever exposed anyone tb
determine whether intimate household contact whether limited contact distant nonhousehold relative casual acquaintance
past history pneumonia also searched specific questioning volunteered initial general inquiry
term pneumonia well known patients may asked simply ever pneumonia
patients may use outdated terms walking pneumonia double pneumonia describe past episode
affirmative response determined diagnosis made physician based physical examination andor chest roentgenogram conclusion patient based unusually severe respiratory illness seek medical care
single episode pneumonia occurred remote past probably worth additional questions however pneumonia occurred within past years andor patient multiple episodes pneumonia additional information obtained
important determine number episodes dates places treatment chest roentgenograms pertinent information might obtained pneumonias lobe lobes one lung occurred random sites lungs whether patient well episodes whether pattern increasing frequency episodes
cigarette smoker dyspnea exertion chronic sputum production may asked doctor ever told chronic bronchitis emphysema
certainty diagnosis pursued additional questioning
regardless past history specific lung diseases patients asked last chest x ray present visit
names physician andor facility performed date obtained
patient current chest roentgenogram abnormal suggesting past present pulmonary disorder previous chest roentgenogram invaluable
circumstances patient recall may helped suggesting possible sources preemployment medical examinations health department screening examinations especially tuberculosis exposure military induction discharge examinations periodic physical examinations physician office employee health clinic routine chest roentgenograms taken hospitals prior elective surgery well chest roentgenograms taken specifically evaluate follow pulmonary disorders
outside sources medical data chest roentgenograms require authorization release information
including written request facilitate access data
sometimes expedient contact facility telephone
caller adequately identifies legitimate representative facility might provide information verbally
receipt information mail might expedited verbal request
year marked one hundredth anniversary announcement robert koch tubercle bacillus named mycobacterium tuberculosis causative organism tuberculosis
dreaded disease progressively decreased incidence cause death united states
recent increase incidence tuberculosis related aids epidemic
transmission infection usually inhalation contaminated airborne droplet particles infected individuals
organism commonly inhaled alveoli lower lobes ingested macrophages
may either killed macrophage proliferate intracellularly eventually killing macrophage
initial pulmonary infection usually localized immune system however organisms often enter blood stream via pulmonary lymphatics called silent bacillemia
organisms may lodge tissue apt survive proliferate pulmonary apices lymphatic system serosal surfaces kidney adrenal gland bone
host immunity entirely cell mediated macrophage effector cell lymphocyte immunoresponsive cell
host response tissues characterized granuloma formation
large amounts antigen hypersensitivity reaction may cause tissue destruction caseation caseous necrosis
healing occurs fibrosis granuloma walling lesion hindering spread
interestingly organism may survive years healed granulomas may begin multiplying host immunity weakens
growth organism apex lung months years initial infection produces characteristic picture upper lobe pulmonary tuberculosis
proliferation site produces extrapulmonary tuberculosis
host whose immune system unable localize kill organism adequately may develop diffuse hematogenously borne disease known disseminated miliary tuberculosis
epidemiologically disease country become largely one inner city high rates seen overcrowded slum areas
derelict alcoholic inner city commonly becomes infected
whether racial differences susceptibility unclear controversial
exception hematogenously borne organisms lodge lung microbial organisms cause pneumonia either inhaled directly lung reach lung via upper airway secretions draining lower airway aspiration
whether acute pneumonia results depends number organisms reaching lung lung defense mechanisms
large number organisms produce pneumonia spite normal defense mechanisms whereas much smaller number may required presence impaired host defenses
almost individuals aspirate small amounts oropharyngeal secretions tracheobronchial tree especially sleep
organisms present material include normal oropharyngeal flora well bacteria colonized upper respiratory tract
colonization seems depend phenomenon called bacterial adherence
certain organisms capable attaching upper respiratory squamous epithelial cells thus become transient permanent flora
severely ill patients may develop oropharyngeal colonization aerobic gram negative bacteria whereas normal individuals colonized
colonization correlates highly subsequent nosocomial pneumonia organisms
normal lung defense mechanisms quite adequate maintain sterility tracheobronchial tree despite daily inhalation aspiration organisms
physical barriers include filtering effect nose sneezing coughing tracheobronchial mucous blanket mucociliary escalator
cellular mechanisms important phagocytosis alveolar macrophage important
polymorphonuclear leukocytes also important may attracted lung neutrophil chemotaxins
specific immunity b lymphocytes may present evoked also nonspecific components tracheobronchial secretions inactivate kill organisms
include secretory iga lysozyme interferon lactoferrin complement granulocyte proteases
pathologic state interferes one defense mechanisms increases risk pulmonary infection
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd probably commonly used term country refer patients chronic bronchitis andor emphysema
accepted clinical definition chronic bronchitis sputum production days week least months year consecutive years
thus basis definition chronic mucus hypersecretion bronchial tree related hypertrophy hyperplasia bronchial mucous glands increase number goblet cells
emphysema defined condition lung characterized increase beyond normal size air spaces distal terminal bronchioles either dilation destruction walls
instances cause chronic bronchitis andor emphysema cigarette smoking although hereditary forms emphysema e g alpha antitrypsin deficiency
functional impairment decreased exercise tolerance relates chronic airflow obstruction cao measured spirometrically ventilation perfusion mismatching emphysema reduction alveolar surface area pulmonary capillary bed
cigarette smokers develop disabling cao age
completely clear individuals develop cao others
case chronic bronchitis current data suggest chronic mucus hypersecretion cao independent processes
experimental emphysema produced aerosolizing human neutrophil elastase animals lungs
protease antiprotease theory emphysema proposes emphysema results whenever neutrophil elastase liberated lung antiproteases able inactivate
also data suggest cigarette smoking may result neutrophil accumulation lung cigarette smoke may interfere action antiproteases alpha antitrypsin
clinical picture relatively pure chronic bronchitis characterized wheezing cough sputum production hypoxemia intermittent hypercapnia cor pulmonale acute respiratory failure
response medications bronchodilators early states substantial progression however medications become less less effective
pure emphysema characterized almost exclusively progressive decrease exercise tolerance
toward end course patient becomes exhausted minor activities shaving bathing eating
hypercapnia cor pulmonale acute respiratory failure near terminal occurrences seldom reversible
pleural space potential space
parietal visceral pleura constant contact two surfaces glide smoothly across respiratory motion
disease state produces inflammation pleural surfaces causes become roughened fibrinous exudate
result symptom pleuritic chest pain mediated pain fibers parietal pleura
pleural effusion pleural friction rub may may occur
air may present pleural space perforation visceral pleura perforation chest wall parietal pleura gas forming bacteria pleural space
spontaneous pneumothorax collapsed lung occurs former mechanism
idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax occurs predominately males ages
rupture small subpleural blebs thought cause
taller individuals seem predisposed presumably greater height lungs creates greater pleural pressure differential top bottom resulting negative pressure apex lungs blebs thought rupture
patients age copd predisposes spontaneous pneumothorax
pneumothorax may complication metastatic pulmonary malignancies especially sarcomas
catamenial pneumothorax thought related pleural endometriosis
despite emergence complex diagnostic techniques computerized axial tomography nuclear magnetic resonance standard posteroanterior lateral chest roentgenograms remain inexpensive valuable tools
round densities lung must usually greater
cm diameter visible unless calcified
carcinoma lung may present several years reaching size seen chest roentgenogram
many previous widespread screening uses chest roentgenogram abandoned
mass chest x ray screening tuberculosis cost effective past years
screening lung cancer controversial
screening x rays routine hospital admissions challenged
screening chest x rays patients age prior elective surgery also seems little value
chest x ray however valuable following resolution pneumonia increase size undiagnosed pulmonary lesions well assessing suspected pulmonary disease
official american thoracic society classification tuberculosis shown table
certain patients fall class receive isoniazid mg daily months
include recent tuberculin skin test converters household contacts known cases persons age persons increased susceptibility tuberculosis including patients high doses corticosteroids andor immunosuppressive drugs hematologic reticuloendothelial diseases suppress cell mediated immunity silicosis diabetes mellitus post gastrectomy patient
patients fall class receive similar treatment never received adequate antituberculous chemotherapy
patients reactivation rates range
per year
patient active pulmonary tuberculosis whose past history includes previous treatment tuberculosis early days chemotherapy isoniazid streptomycin andor para amino salicylic acid approximately chance organisms resistant one drugs especially isoniazid
susceptibility testing results known coverage include isoniazid rifampin ethambutol andor pyrazinamide
patients might harbor isoniazid resistant organisms include immigrants asia latin america africa patients acquired disease patient isoniazid resistance patients previously received isoniazid chemoprophylaxis
bear mind granulomatous pulmonary infections histoplasmosis pulmonary fungal infections well necrotizing bacterial pneumonias may produce roentgenographic infiltrates similar tuberculosis
although pneumonia common disease requires major breakdown host defenses therefore somewhat unusual otherwise healthy person
person depression defense mechanisms may transient
viral respiratory infections especially influenza impair lung bacterial clearance predispose secondary bacterial pneumonia reaching peak days onset
recurrent pneumonias tend occur individuals chronic alterations lung defense mechanisms
recurrent pneumonias generally categorized predilection particular area either lung tend occur lobe lobes table
recurrent pneumonias lobe lobes suggest focal problem mucociliary clearance
partial complete obstruction bronchus malignant benign neoplasm aspirated foreign body cause either recurrent persistent pneumonia one area lung
localized bronchial disease bronchiectasis also predispose distal pneumonia
localized bronchial narrowing extrinsic compression right middle lobe syndrome also cause recurrent distal pneumonias
recurrent aspiration gastric contents produce recurrent pneumonias gravity dependent segments lungs include superior posterior basilar segments lower lobes posterior segments upper lobes
recurrent pneumonias tendency occur one particular area occur number clinical settings
include general debilitating illnesses alcoholism diabetes mellitus congestive heart failure carcinomatosis situations impaired humoral andor cellular immunity including lymphoma leukemia multiple myeloma immunoglobulin deficiency acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids treatment corticosteroids andor immunosuppressive drugs diffuse airway diseases including asthma especially children chronic bronchitis emphysema cystic fibrosis immotile cilia syndrome ineffective ventilation cough occur depressed level consciousness etiology neuromuscular weakness myasthenia gravis muscular dystrophy
approaching patients recurrent pneumonia persistent pneumonia sites diagnostic measures aimed detecting bronchial obstructions bronchoscopy andor radiographic techniques computerized axial tomography
patients recurrent pneumonias random sites obvious predisposing conditions considered study serum immunoglobulin determinations bone marrow aspirations urine andor serum protein electrophoresis
patients recurrent pneumonias due streptococcus pneumoniae may benefit pneumococcal vaccine
patients bronchiectasis sometimes benefit suppressive antibiotic therapy well postural drainage
history copd important several standpoints
first prognosis
patients copd lose average ml forced expiratory volume second fev year although varies considerably patient patient
data suggest cessation cigarette smoking results less rapid decline function therefore major effort launched get patient quit smoking
done sympathetic understanding manner approach cant see idiot
use nicotine gum plus counseling quite helpful
second diagnosis copd bring mind several predispositions
patients likely contract lobar bronchopneumonia
undergo major abdominal thoracic surgery apt develop postoperative atelectasis pneumonia respiratory failure normal patient
patients copd also higher incidence pulmonary thromboembolism duodenal ulcer
patient copd may optimum medical regimen
addition aerosolized oral bronchodilators patients corticosteroids selected patients improve symptoms functional capacity considerably
additionally data suggest patients chronic hypoxemia pao mm hg andor evidence hypoxic organ dysfunction cor pulmonale secondary polycythemia lower year mortality given oxygen sufficient raise pao mm hg home least hours day
lastly young patient emphysema may alpha antitrypsin deficiency
members family risk genetic counseling may order
history pleurisy elicited number possible etiologies exist
single past episode otherwise healthy individual likely viral idiopathic pleurisy perhaps related pneumonia
probably little clinical importance
contrary causes pleurisy may greater significance
patients develop tuberculous pleurisy treated high incidence pulmonary extrapulmonary tuberculosis within years episode
previous exposure tuberculosis positive tuberculin skin test reaction raise high index suspicion
acute pulmonary embolism serious cause pleuritic chest pain
patients predisposing factors past history venous thrombosis scrutinized carefully pulmonary thromboembolism tends recurrent fatal
pleuritic chest pain pleural effusion also occur polyserosal disorders systemic lupus erythematosis
disorder capable causing exudative pleural effusion cause pleuritic chest pain
history previous spontaneous pneumothorax important recurrence rate idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax high
multiple recurrences may warrant consideration type pleural ablative procedure usually surgical
young woman develops recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces menses suffering rare condition catamenial pneumothorax
hormonal therapy pleural ablation used prevent recurrences
obtaining previous chest x ray comparison patient solitary pulmonary nodule save patient expense discomfort possible morbidity invasive diagnostic procedures shown lesion stable several years
patients stable benign pulmonary lesions given copy chest x rays keep home
one frustrating circumstances find lesion current chest x ray probably present previous x ray previous x ray misplaced destroyed stability lesion proved
previous chest roentgenograms help evaluate progression stability resolution numerous diffuse localized pulmonary diseases
