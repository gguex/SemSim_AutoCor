tobacco use may defined habitual use tobacco plant leaf products
predominant use tobacco smoke inhalation cigarettes pipes cigars
smokeless tobacco refers variety tobacco products either sniffed sucked chewed
questions regarding tobacco use traditionally included social history habits may fit appropriately inquiring patient pulmonary cardiovascular status
patients aware smoking may affect health expect asked habit
unlike cigarettes potential adverse health effects smokeless tobacco well known patients often surprised questioned
females males young elderly asked use forms tobacco
technique inquiring tobacco use divided two categories smoked smokeless tobacco
direct approach best questions asked nonaccusatory fashion
ask smoke cigarettes cigars pipe
patient answers ask ever smoked
stop smoking
questions important relate cancer risk severity lung disease
patient answers affirmatively try accurately quantify amount
cigarette smoking quantified inquiring portion pack many packs smoked per day many years
standard package contains cigarettes
translated pack years
cigar smoking similarly quantified number cigars per day many years cigar years
pipe smoking difficult quantify many pipe smokers actually pipe lit time
perhaps easiest way quantify pipe smoking number bowlfuls tobacco used per day long pouch tobacco lasts
also important quantify degree smoke inhalation best done categorizing inhalation mild moderate inhalation deep inhalation
history inquire patient attempts stop smoking
ever tried quit smoking
quit
long quit
believe quit
elicit information
questioning patient attention given presence tobacco stains teeth fingers
odor tobacco may obvious noted
physicians inquire specifically use smokeless tobacco patients volunteer information
also term smokeless tobacco recognized patients
simplest way ask dip snuff use chewing tobacco
may help mention specific brand names skoal copenhagen
patient responds affirmatively quantify amount used many years
unusual find individuals started using smokeless tobacco years old
smokeless tobacco use quantified finding portion many packages particular product used hour period
snuff packaged cans containing grams tobacco chewing tobacco comes gram pouches containing square plugs bricks
amount used may described example half snuff per day years one pouch tobacco per day years
could also recorded years pouch years similar pack years used cigarette smoking
also important find number hours per day tobacco kept mouth juices expectorated swallowed
longer tobacco mouth greater local effects larger proportion juices swallowed nicotine glucose sodium systemically absorbed
nicotine alkaloid present tobacco products well absorbed mucosal surfaces respiratory tract skin
acts preganglionic postganglionic synapse resulting stimulation sympathetic parasympathetic nerve fibers
exerts complex action transient depressant effect autonomic nervous system sympathetic effect cardiovascular system
latter summarized increased heart rate blood pressure stroke volume cardiac output
combustion products smoked tobacco also yield tar nitrous oxides carbon monoxide
tar related products associated cancer risk
autopsy studies cigarette smokers patients dying lung cancer show increased morphologic changes squamous metaplasia acanthosis dyskeratosis mitotic figures bronchial epithelial cells compared controls
changes generally considered precursors bronchogenic cancer
inhaled carbon monoxide leads increased levels carboxyhemoglobin much resulting reduced tissue oxygenation
experimental animals smoke inhalation shown cause focal swelling aortic endothelial cells appearance microvilli like processes
subsequently create intimal ridges folds may serve initial areas mural thrombosis plaque formation
cigarette smoking also increases platelet adhesiveness
addition nicotine smokeless tobacco contains nitrosamines sodium glucose glycyrrhizinic acid grit
sodium content ranges mg per container pouch
chewing tobacco highest content glucoseas much gmdl
licorice used flavoring contains glycyrrhizinic acid concentrations sufficient induce hypokalemia mimic hyperaldosteronism
tobacco products habituating addicting
like addictive drugs abstinence leads syndrome restlessness agitation depression mostly relieved nicotine administration
nearly compounds identified cigarette smoke tar carbon dioxide nitrous oxides nicotine responsible major health hazards smoking
tobacco specific n nitrosamines produced smokeless tobacco nicotine nornicotine anatabine curing processing
shown carcinogenic
use tobacco products particularly cigarette smoking important preventable public health problem developed countries
approximately one third adults united states cigarette smokers million used various forms smokeless tobacco
united states alone estimated deaths per year attributed effects tobacco
economic loss measured temporary permanent disability outpatient visits hospital days amounts billions dollars
many consequences smoking forms tobacco use well established
increasing popularity cigarette smoking first half century resulted dramatic rise lung cancer deaths
first noticeable men recent data show lung cancer becoming leading cause death cancer women smoking related cancers alone explain recent increase mortality cancer united states
beginning late effects smoking investigated several retrospective prospective studies
studies reported reviewed updated surgeon general reports u
public health service authorities
studies showed excess total mortality cigarette smokers greater nonsmokers depended age starting smoking number cigarettes smoked per day
example man started smoking cigarettes day age life expectancy would reduced
years
man smoked cigarettes day life expectancy would reduced
years
life loss
minutes per cigarette smoked
major causes death tobacco use include lung cancer coronary artery disease cad chronic obstructive lung disease cold
estimated lung cancer deaths united states associated smoking
cessation smoking reduces risk lung cancer mortality compared continuing smoker
carcinogenic effect cigarette smoking synergistic carcinogenic agents asbestosis
cancer mouth larynx esophagus also common among smokers especially smoke cigarettes table
smoking also related development cardiovascular disease especially coronary artery disease cad
particular association smoking cardiovascular disease appreciated well publication framingham study
since cad recognized one important consequences smoking
cancer risk increased number cigarettes smoked per day age starting smoking degree inhalation
risk developing untoward events due cad reduced dramatically cigarette smoking stopped years cessation smoking risk cad ex smokers nonsmokers
interestingly effect smoking present adjustments levels serum cholesterol blood pressure degree physical activity presence obesity
studies show three sixfold incidence death non syphilitic aortic aneurysms heavy cigarette smokers nonsmokers
progression thromboangiitis obliterans buerger disease primarily determined smoking
risk subarachnoid hemorrhage increased women smoke use oral contraceptives compared women neither smoke use oral contraceptives
smoking important determinant chronic obstructive lung disease
cigarette smokers risk developing cold times nonsmokers pipe cigar smokers risk increased one one half threefold
risk lung disease also influenced geographic location climate
one study risk cold among british physicians smoked cigarettes per day increased twentyfold group u
veterans smoked cigarettes per day eightfold increased risk
recent studies documented association maternal smoking pregnancy infant birth weight
babies born women smoke pregnancy lower birth weight babies nonsmoking women social class
studies demonstrated slightly greater neonatal mortality among infants smokers
cigarette smoking also associated peptic ulcer disease
increased frequency duodenal ulcer reduced ulcer healing recurrent ulceration documented
clinical implications smokeless tobacco use divided local systemic effects
local effects include irritation oral mucosa alkaline ph grit result gum recession exposure neck tooth abrasion enamel surface
chronic inflammation initiates epithelial dysplasia buccal mucosa eventually resulting leucoplakia considered premalignant lesion
rate malignant transformation leucoplakic areas
nodular speckled leucoplakic areas tend highest rate malignant transformation
local effects include decreased sense taste chronic exposure alkaline ph increased incidence caries high glucose content
multiple systemic effects smokeless tobacco use include absorption significant amounts nicotine
described earlier nicotine exerts sympathomimetic effect cardiovascular system
several studies demonstrated significant rise blood pressure pulse fall fingertip skin temperature using smokeless tobacco
changes felt hemodynamically significant could affect care patients hypertension angina congestive heart failure raynaud phenomenon peripheral vascular disease
chronic exposure smokeless tobacco reported cause neuromuscular disease manifested loss muscle bulk strength endurance
tobacco amblyopia gradual loss visual acuity bright light secondary nicotine absorption seen smokeless tobacco users well smokers
presence salt glucose flavorings present smokeless tobacco may affect therapeutic regimen certain groups patients hypertensives patients congestive heart failure diabetics
