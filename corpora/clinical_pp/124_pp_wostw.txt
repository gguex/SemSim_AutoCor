epistaxis refers nasal bleeding cause
epistaxis minor insignificant may severe life threatening indicative serious disease
obtaining history epistaxis clinician try establish quantity frequency bleeding well uncover underlying factor contributes problem
bleeding occurs result disruption intact nasal mucosa whether due trauma inflammation neoplasm
traumatic events would include nose picking foreign body insertion desiccation due breathing poorly humidified air common winter months cocaine snorting direct blunt trauma
social disapproval history nose picking may difficult obtain forms trauma usually determined
inquiries made general health nose paranasal sinuses
increase nasal mucus production color character quantity discharge
nasal obstruction present acute chronic
signs sinus infection fever facial pressure pain pain teeth
many cases actual cause epistaxis obtained history
important however consider whether conditions present may make bleeding severe
patient clotting abnormalities thrombocytopenia platelet dysfunction
patients hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia oslerweberrendu syndrome often debilitating nose bleeds often give positive family history bleeding well history bleeding sources
hypertension often associated epistaxis cause nasal bleeding certainly exacerbates problem makes control difficult
nose acts conduit allow air body also well vascularized mucosa complex interior surface consisting folds irregularities
characteristics provide large surface area warm humidify inspired air
blood supply nose comes internal external carotid systems
external carotid system provides blood supply maxillary artery sphenopalatine artery enters nose near posterior end middle turbinate divides supply septum lateral wall nose
branches anastomose branches anterior posterior ethmoidal artery come internal carotid way ophthalmic artery
one notable area anastomosis anterior portion septum plexus vessels known kisselbach plexus particularly vulnerable digital well direct blunt trauma
vessels run beneath delicate mucosa supported tightly adherent rigid structure bone cartilage provide little cushioning traumatic forces
anatomic factors considering prominent location projection nose face easy see nose commonly fractured portion facial skeleton epistaxis frequently occurs result
furthermore nasal function providing inlet transmission air respiratory tract makes nose susceptible drying infection inflammation outside environmental factors
little wonder nose common site spontaneous bleeding exception uterine cervix
cases epistaxis occurs occasional event easily controlled digital pressure little nuisance
usually case younger patient
older patient bleeding tends posteriorly located nose difficult control
important recognize nasal bleeding severe life threatening exsanguination occur
sine qua non diagnosis control bleeding careful physical examination
strong headlight head mirror nasal speculum suction topical mucosal vasoconstriction essential identification bleeding site assess general health nasal mucosa
control bleeding may require packing nose
