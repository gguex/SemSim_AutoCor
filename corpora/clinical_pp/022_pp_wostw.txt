second heart sound short burst auditory vibrations varying intensity frequency quality duration
two audible components aortic closure sound pulmonic closure sound p normally split inspiration virtually single expiration
produced part hemodynamic events immediately following closure aortic pulmonic valves
vibrations second heart sound occur end ventricular contraction identify onset ventricular diastole end mechanical systole
examination performed warm quiet room manner identical described chapter first heart sound
clinical assessment best performed patient lying comfortably supine position breathing normally
first attempt palpate aortic pulmonic components second heart sound second right second third left intercostal spaces ics respectively
begin cardiac auscultation stethoscope placed second right ics
second sound like first evaluated sequentially auscultating second left ics fourth left ics along left sternal border cardiac apex
listening heart sounds essential simultaneously palpate either carotid artery apex impulse determine onset systole
second heart sound shorter duration higher frequency first heart sound
two audible components aortic closure sound pulmonic closure sound p must separated msec
sec order differentiated heard two distinct sounds
clinically important determine presence degree respiratory splitting relative intensities p
splitting best identified second third left ics since softer p normally confined area whereas louder heard entire precordium including apex
order appreciate splitting may useful gradually move stethoscope inching second right ics fourth left ics
influence respiration second sound extremely important
examiner wish note respiratory variation quiet breathing times exaggerated breathing
slow regular respirations best auscultation long deep breath may attentuate p interposing lung tissue stethoscope single sound heard
interval two audible components second heart sound normally increases inspiration virtually disappears expiration
patient age must taken consideration assessing splitting second sound since likelihood hearing single respiratory phases increases advancing age
first sound patient examined several positions
supine position young patients example may yield erroneous impression abnormally wide splitting avoided reexamining patient sitting standing position
valsalva maneuver may also used exaggerate splitting second sound
second sound split components heard identified reliable judgment relative loudness intensity component made
rouanet years ago attributed second heart sound closure aortic pulmonic valves
although explanation generally accepted present time several theories proposed explain genesis second heart sound
tenable date suggests closure aortic pulmonic valves initiates series events produces second heart sound
main audible components however result vibrations cardiac structures valve closure
using high fidelity catheter tipped micro manometers echophonocardiography shown aortic pulmonic valves close silently coaptation aortic valve cusps precedes onset second sound milliseconds
second sound therefore originates vibrations cusps walls blood columns great vessels respective ventricles
energy oscillations comes sudden deceleration retrograde flow column blood aorta pulmonary artery elastic limits tensed valve leaflets met
abrupt deceleration sets whole cardiohemic system vibration
order understand splitting second heart sound knowledge relationship cardiac cycle essential
p coincident incisurac aorta pulmonary artery pressure curves respectively terminate left right ventricular ejection periods
right ventricular ejection begins prior left ventricular ejection slightly longer duration terminates left ventricular ejection resulting p normally occurring
differences aortic pulmonary artery vascular impedance characteristics also essential understanding effects respiration splitting
pressure curves pulmonary artery right ventricle recorded simultaneously pulmonary artery curve level incisura dicrotic notch lags behind right ventricular curve hangs
duration hangout interval measure impedance pulmonary artery system
highly compliant low resistance high capacitance pulmonary vascular bed hangout interval may vary msec contributing significantly duration right ventricular ejection
left side heart impedance much greater hangout interval aorta left ventricular pressure curves negligible less equal msec
hangout interval therefore correlates closely impedance vascular bed blood injected
duration appears inversely related vascular impedance
alterations impedance characteristics pulmonary vascular bed right sided hangout interval responsible many observed abnormalities
normal physiologic setting inspiration lowers impedance pulmonary circuit prolongs hangout interval delays pulmonic valve closure resulting audible splitting p
expiration reverse occurs pulmonic valve closure earlier p interval separated less msec may sound single ear
since pulmonary circulation much lower impedance systemic circulation flow pulmonic valve takes longer flow aortic valve
inspiratory split widens mainly delay pulmonic component
traditionally believed inspiratory drop intrathoracic pressure favored greater venous return right ventricle pooling blood lungs decreased return left ventricle
increase right ventricular volume prolonged right sided ejection time delayed p decrease left ventricular volume reduced left sided ejection time caused occur earlier
delayed p early associated inspiration however best understood interplay changes pulmonary vascular impedance changes systemic pulmonary venous return
net effect right ventricular ejection prolonged left ventricular ejection shortened p interval widens inspiration
clinical evaluation second heart sound called key auscultation heart

second expiration usually abnormal
therefore presence audible splitting expiration e ability hear two distinct sounds expiration greater significance bedside identifying underlying cardiac pathology absolute inspiratory increase p interval
respiratory variation second heart sound categorized follows normal physiologic splitting persistent audible expiratory splitting normal respiratory variation persistent splitting without respiratory variation fixed splitting reversed paradoxical splitting
physiologic splitting demonstrated inspiration normal individuals since splitting interval widens primarily due delayed p
expiration p interval narrow single sound usually heard
persistent audible expiratory splitting suggests audible expiratory interval least msec two sounds
persistent splitting audible respiratory phases appropriate inspirational expirational directional changes e increase p interval inspiration may occur recumbent position normal children teenagers young adults
individuals sit stand perform valsalva maneuver however second sound often becomes single expiration
almost patients heart disease audible expiratory splitting recumbent position expiratory splitting persists patient examined sitting standing position
thus finding audible expiratory splitting recumbent upright positions sensitive screening test heart disease
right bundle branch block rbbb common cause persistence audible expiratory splitting standing
causes persistent expiratory splitting standing may due either delay pulmonic valve closure early closure aortic valve
delay p may secondary following
delayed electrical activation right ventricle e g left ventricular ectopic paced beats wolff parkinson white syndrome rbbb
decreased impedance pulmonary vascular bed e g atrial septal defect partial anomalous pulmonary venous return idiopathic dilatation pulmonary artery
right ventricular pressure overload lesions e g pulmonary hypertension right heart failure moderate severe valvular pulmonic stenosis acute massive pulmonary embolus
early may occur patients decreased resistance left ventricular outflow e g mitral regurgitation constrictive pericarditis
moderately large ventricular septal defects may also cause wide splitting second sound aortic component usually difficult hear loud holosystolic murmur
expiratory splitting may occur patients severe congestive heart failure
expiratory splitting usually disappears satisfactory therapy heart failure
high prevalence expiratory splitting cardiomyopathy may explained combination low cardiac output mitral regurgitation pulmonary hypertension right heart failure bundle branch block
fixed splitting denotes absence significant variation splitting interval respiration separation p remains unchanged inspiration expiration
atrial septal defect either normal high pulmonary vascular resistance classic example fixed splitting second sound
audible expiratory splitting patients primarily reflection changes pulmonary vascular bed rather selective volume overload right ventricle prolonging right ventricular systole
fixed nature split due approximately equal inspiratory delay aortic pulmonic components indicating two ventricles share common venous reservoir
respiratory splitting second sound immediately returns normal following surgical repair atrial septal defect although pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed weeks months
severe right heart failure lead relatively fixed split
occurs right ventricle fails respond increased volume produced inspiration lungs congested impedance forward flow right ventricle barely falls inspiration
anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect fixed splitting usually seen despite simultaneous inspiratory delay aortic pulmonic closure
valsalva maneuver may used exaggerate effect respiration obtain clearer separation two components second sound
patients atrial septal defects show continuous splitting strain phase upon release interval components increases less
second
normal subjects however splitting exaggerated release phase valsalva maneuver
variation cardiac cycle length may also used evaluate splitting
longer cardiac cycle patients atrial septal defect may show greater splitting result increased atrial shunting greater disparity stroke volume two ventricles
normal subjects tendency widen splitting longer cardiac cycles
pulmonary artery hypertension causes variable effects splitting second sound
patients ventricular septal defect develop pulmonary hypertension may longer splitting
patients atrial septal defect associated pulmonary hypertension maintain wide fixed split
splitting narrow less msec remains physiologic patients patent ductus arteriosus develop pulmonary hypertension
paradoxical reversed splitting result delay aortic closure sound
therefore p precedes splitting maximal expiration minimal absent inspiration
identification reversed order valve closure may possible judging intensity transmission component second sound
often however pulmonic component loud aortic component pulmonary artery hypertension secondary left ventricular failure
paradoxical narrowing disappearance split inspiration necessary criterion diagnosing reversed splitting auscultation
paradoxical splitting always indicates significant underlying cardiovascular disease usually due prolongation left ventricular activation prolonged left ventricular emptying
common cause paradoxical splitting second sound left bundle branch block
obstruction left ventricular outflow sufficient severity delay aortic valve closure may also cause paradoxical splitting
context aortic stenosis auscultatory finding implies severe obstruction
paradoxical splitting however occurs commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy aortic stenosis
paradoxical splitting second sound may occur first days acute myocardial infarction secondary severe left ventricular dysfunction
mistaken diagnosis abnormal splitting second sound must avoided
late systolic click mitral valve prolapse opening snap os mitral stenosis third heart sound pericardial knock may incorrectly thought represent fixed splitting second sound
systolic click may vary location systole certain maneuvers change shape left ventricle see chapter systolic murmurs
best way differentiate p os patient stand
p interval remains narrows whereas os interval widens
third heart sound forms complex lower frequency best heard apex usually heard basal auscultatory area occurs
second
pericardial knock third heart sound slightly higher pitched earlier usual also best heard apex
second sound remain single throughout respiratory cycle due either absence one component synchronous occurrence two components
since pulmonary vascular impedance increases age many normal patients age single narrow physiologic split inspiration p occurs early
single second sound however usually due inability auscultate relatively soft pulmonic component
inability rare healthy infants children young adults uncommon even older persons good auscultatory conditions using rigid stethoscopic diaphragm
hyperinflation lungs perhaps common cause inability hear pulmonic closure sound
conditions causing paradoxical splitting delay may produce single second sound splitting interval becomes less
second
inaudibility p due true decrease intensity relatively rare however suggests tetralogy fallot pulmonary atresia
pulmonic component may inaudible chronic right ventricular failure aortic component may masked systolic murmur patients aortic stenosis
pulmonary closure completely fused aortic closure throughout respiratory cycle eisenmenger syndrome large ventricular septal defect cases single ventricle durations right left ventricular systole virtually equal
second sound may also single variety congenital heart defects e g truncus arteriosus tricuspid atresia hypoplastic left heart syndrome transposition great arteries occasionally corrected transposition great arteries
loudness component second heart sound proportional respective pressures aorta pulmonary artery onset diastole
dilatation aorta pulmonary artery may also cause accentuation aortic pulmonic components respectively
aortic component normally greater intensity pulmonic component
aortic component therefore radiates widely chest whereas pulmonic component heard mainly second left ics radiation left sternal border
greater radiation aortic component probably due higher pressure aorta compared pulmonary artery
given level pressure however pulmonic component proportionately louder aortic component closer proximity pulmonic valve pulmonary artery chest wall
considerations account relative loudness p young patients pulmonary arteries quite close chest wall
also account decreased intensity components second sound patients emphysema arteries displaced chest wall
pulmonic component considered abnormally loud subject age greater aortic component second left ics audible cardiac apex
may due either pulmonary artery hypertension right ventricular dilatation part right ventricle assuming position normally occupied left ventricle
split second sound apex therefore definitely abnormal
loud p commonly heard apex patients atrial septal defect probably due dilated right ventricle encroaching upon cardiac apex
decreased intensity either component second sound may due stiff semilunar valve decreased pressure beyond semilunar valve deformity chest wall lung
decreased intensity p common patients chronic obstructive lung disease valvular pulmonic stenosis
decreased intensity common patients valvular aortic stenosis
