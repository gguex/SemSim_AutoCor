proliferation edema connective tissue result loss normal angle skin nail plate excessive sponginess nail base
clubbing usually acquired associated certain cardiopulmonary gastrointestinal disorders may occur congenital familial forms
acropachy alternative term clubbing
acquired clubbing often reversible associated condition treated successfully
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy advanced stage clubbing painful periosteal proliferation long bones radius ulna tibia
periostitis often associated mild fever arthralgia joint effusion
peripheral neurovascular disease cyanosis excessive sweating hyperhidrosis paresthesias muscular weakness also occur
pachydermoperiostosis syndrome combines hyper trophic osteoarthropathy acromegalic features
patients disorder cylindrical thickening limbs due periostosis skin changes
skin changes include marked thickening oiliness skin hands forearms legs accentuation facial folds hyperhidrosis hands feet reduplication furrowing skin scalp called cutis verticis gyrata bulldog scalp
may also macroglossia
hereditary form pachydermoperiostosis may inherited autosomal dominant trait incomplete penetrance severe males
usually onset late teens
acquired form associated family history disorder usually occurs older men associated coexisting chronic cardiopulmonary gastrointestinal neoplasm infection
clubbing usually painless bilateral
patient may unaware gradual enlargement fingertips toes brought attention
patients hereditary clubbing may report family history clubbing long duration clubbing without symptoms signs suggest underlying illness
acute cases rapid onset mild associated discomfort may draw attention deformity
important detect early clubbing clubbing first clue serious underlying disorder treated early may curable
clubbing usually develops first thumb forefinger occurs fingers later
may difficult recognize unless examiner observes hands feet carefully
two signs characteristic early clubbing floating nail sign profile sign
floating nail sign easily demonstrated figure
normally root nail plate lies snugly bone distal phalanx pressure root produces movement
clubbing root separated bone connective tissue edema pressure upon nail plate moves toward bone
base nail becomes resilient springy nail feels floating cushion
clubbing progresses nail becomes loosely attached free edge nail plate may become visible palpable horizontal ridge dorsal aspect finger
profile sign illustrated figures
normally angle nail plate skin overlying proximal part distal phalanx degrees less
clubbing proliferation tissue nail plate causes angle increase degrees
fact angle may entirely lost nail plate skin lie straight line degree angle
clubbing progresses angle exceeds degrees
eventually profile fingertip becomes bulbous
obliteration angle nail nailbed first sign clubbing constant feature indeed many require diagnosis
easily detected precisely defined examiner rely sign uncertain patient fingers truly clubbed
early clubbing must distinguished several abnormalities fingertip
include increased nail curvature normal finding many adults especially blacks chronic paronychiae soft tissue base nail inflammed swollen felons abscesses terminal pulp space swelling palmar surface fingertip
none conditions however fundamental angle nail terminal phalanx altered
simple maneuver described schamroth readily differentiates true clubbing pseudo clubbing conditions
examiner asks patient hold two thumbs back back two fingertips interphalangeal joints aligned
base angle unaltered conditions elongated diamond shaped area empty space apparent
true clubbing empty space lost
schamroth ill subacute bacterial endocarditis noted finding one earliest signs clubbing also reported window empty space reappeared months endocarditis treated successfully
increased nail curvature occurs clubbing appears later either proliferation tissue nail base loss normal angle distal phalanx nail
though increased nail curvature specific clubbing occurs entire nail assumes abnormally convex appearance often described watch crystal nail
later still entire distal phalanx enlarged bulbous may resemble drumstick
clubbing toes difficult recognize tips toes may normally appear somewhat bulbous
true clubbing usually easiest recognize great toe
addition examiner may learn recognize clubbing toes frequently found patients clubbing fingers
finally acute cases patient may noted either mild discomfort changed appearance digits
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy always sought clubbing found
symptomatic patient hypertrophic osteoarthropathy complain severe burning deep pain distal extremities especially legs worsened night dependency
early cases examiner may note warmth reddening brawny edema skin distal long bones particularly shins
acute severe cases may exquisite tenderness feet legs hands forearms tenderness effusions adjacent joints ankles knees wrists fingers
examiner may elicit tenderness bony prominences simply pressing encircling limb e g wrist fingers like bracelet gently squeezing
later autonomic changes flushing sweating blanching raynaud phenomenon may noted affected hands feet
patients pachydermoperiostosis often complain changing appearance excessive perspiration especially hands feet
active phase disorder may mild bone pain arthralgia
later may complain clumsiness fingers ptosis thickening skin eyelids facial palsy thickening skull
examination skeleton clubbing fingers toes accompanied spadelike pawlike enlargement hands feet joint effusions may present
skin changes include excessive sweating generalized thickening called pachyderma redundancy especially forehead scalp leading characteristic bulldog furrowing cutis verticis gyrata leonine facies sometimes mistaken leprosy
cylindrical thickening extremities resulting combination bony enlargement thickening skin often impressive physical finding may suggest diagnosis acromegaly
three conditions e clubbing hypertrophic osteoarthropathy pachydermoperiostosis physician specifically examine findings associated illness including wheezes rales pleural effusion supraclavicular adenopathy cardiac murmurs roth spots peripheral stigmata endocarditis splenomegaly jaundice vascular angiomata palmar erythema hepatomegaly abdominal mass suggesting regional enteritis thyromegaly ophthalmopathy
addition clubbing may manifestation either hypertrophic osteoarthropathy pachydermoperiostosis clinician may want obtain x rays distal extremities
early clubbing x rays normal except increased soft tissue
later stages may fraying edges distal phalanx followed gradual resorption bone acro osteolysis
x rays patients hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may show symmetrical irregular periosteal proliferation calcification new bone formation periostitis distal arms legs acro osteolysis distal phalanges fingers toes
finding technetium pyrophosphate bone scans sensitive plain x rays detecting early periostitis helpful difficult cases
advanced cases osteoarthropathy pachydermoperiostosis x rays may show extreme degrees periostitis almost bone although skull vertebrae articular surfaces usually spared
synovial fluid obtained arthrocentesis patients painful joint effusions osteoarthropathy usually non inflammatory leukocyte count less mm neutrophils
interestingly fluid tends clot spontaneously aspiration finding usually reserved inflammatory effusions
radiologic laboratory studies chest x ray small bowel series thyroid function panel blood cultures may performed examine underlying illness
patient symptoms signs indicate appropriate procedures
although many explanatory theories put forward etiology clubbing unknown
flavell quotes west said clubbing one phenomena familiar appear know really
shneerson reviews four likely mechanisms underlying clubbing
include circulating vasodilator tissue hypoxia neurocirculatory reflex genetic factors
acquired clubbing likely mechanism postulates neurocirculatory reflex leading increased blood flow multiple arteriovenous shunts distal phalanges
increased blood flow leads tissue hypertrophy hyperplasia nutritional basis
evidence mechanism threefold clubbing may resolve vagotomy disturbances vasculature arteriovenous fistulae aneurysms associated development racoceanu others demonstrated increased blood flow digitial capillaries acquired clubbing
flavell first proposed neurocirculatory reflex theory explain hypertrophic osteoarthropathy observed severing vagus nerve could reverse even underlying lung cancer unresectable
according theory reflex afferent impulses travel vagus nerve inciting focus lung tumor central nervous system
efferent limb proposed reflex unknown presumably humoral substance neural impulse mediates vascular changes leading hypertrophy fibroconnective tissues
others supported mechanism observations visceral organs associated diseases occur innervated glossopharyngeal vagus nerves
strong support theory also come study gold colleagues
studied unique case unilateral clubbing secondary posttraumatic aneurysm ulnar artery resolved resection aneurysm
using contralateral hand otherwise healthy patient conducted detailed studies microcirculation doppler flow recordings differential pulse pressure measurements angiography measurements reactive hyperemia differential capillary blood gas determinations
interpreted findings increased blood flow decreased peripheral resistance increased oxygenation support neurocirculatory reflex mechanism
postulated efferent limb reflex cholinergic fibers autonomic sympathetic innervation digital arteriovenous shunts
however different mechanisms may cause acquired hereditary clubbing
workers found digital capillary blood flow measured washout krypton solution increased acquired clubbing normal hereditary clubbing
alternative explanation finding may hereditary clubbing condition studied condition stopped progressing physiologic findings might similar active phase
may different pathogeneses acquired clubbing osteoarthropathy
may occur without
conditions frequently associated clubbing seldom seen osteoarthropathy vice versa
left right pulmonary arteriovenous shunting may important pathogenesis osteoarthropathy patients chronic liver disease explain others marked right left shunts
overall however pathology physiology limbs affected osteoarthropathy resemble digits affected clubbing
study synovial tissue patients hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy shown evidence microvascular injury perhaps related electron dense deposits found synovial vessel walls
dense deposits stain immunoglobulins complement however may simply represent proteins fibrinogen leaked damaged blood vessel walls
pathogenesis pachydermoperiostosis seems quite different
blood flow limbs measured plethysmography arteriovenous oxygen differences normal capillaroscopy shows vessels angiograms show slowed flow segmental arterial narrowing
various humoral agents hormones proposed explain pathogenesis little evidence support mechanism
example despite acromegaloid features affected patients evidence ectopic secretion excessive amounts growth hormone
