normal pupil size adults varies mm diameter bright light mm dark
pupils generally equal size
constrict direct illumination direct response illumination opposite eye consensual response
pupil dilates dark
pupils constrict eye focused near object accommodative response
pupil abnormal fails dilate dark fails constrict light accommodation
popular acronym perrlapupils equal round reactive light accommodationis convenient incomplete description pupillomotor function

record data easy read recall
example one method
normally convergence reaction brisk extensive light reaction
extent constriction depends also condition iris
brown iris contracts less blue iris
old people patients iris atrophy sphincter becomes rigid hence light reaction diminishes extent
size pupil controlled activities two muscles circumferential sphincter muscle found margin iris innervated parasympathetic nervous system iris dilator muscle running radially iris root peripheral border sphincter
iris dilator fibers contain adrenergic sympathetic receptors respond changes sympathetic tonus changes blood level circulating catecholamines
pupillary light reflex arc begins retina figure
considerable evidence exists visual cells retina rods cones also serve light receptors controlling pupillomotor activity
fibers originating nasal neuroreceptor cells decussate optic chiasm opposite optic tract whereas temporal fibers continue homolateral optic tract
pupillary fibers eyes within optic tract pass via superior quadrigeminal brachium superior colliculus mesencephalic pretectum pretectal nuclei
axons pretectal nucleus pass ipsilaterally contralaterally ipsilateral contralateral edinger westphal e w nucleus subnucleus oculomotor nuclear complex hemidecussation pupillary fibers optic chiasm pretectal nuclei ensures e w nucleus receives information level incoming light eye
hence pupils equal diameter regardless level vision either eye
example patient one blind eye pretectal nuclei would register transmit e w nucleus one half normal level illumination
transmission less pupilloconstrictor tone iris sphincter would result slightly larger pupils equal diameter
accordingly anisocoria unequal pupillary diameter attributable angle light strikes face unilateral cataracts asymmetric refractive error unless local disease anterior segment
parasympathetic axons e w nucleus join outflow oculomotor subnuclei form trunk oculomotor nerve
pupillomotor fibers assume superficial location nerve exits mesencephalon interpeduncular space
orbit parasympathetic components synapse ciliary ganglion
postganglionic fibers traveling short ciliary nerves innervate ciliary body inducing lens accommodation pupilloconstrictor muscles iris
ratio fibers innervating ciliary body supplying pupil approximately
acetylcholine serves neurotransmitter functions
pupillary near reflex consists three separate synergistic phenomena accommodation convergence pupillary constriction
near reflex general fundamental component stereoscopic vision
using macaque monkey jampel showed three components near reflex elicited electrical stimulation occipital association cortex
fact slight variations position stimulating electrode changing stimulus intensity various components could obtained partial combinations occasion alone
exact anatomic pathways connecting cerebral cortex midbrain unresolved
evidence however derived mainly clinical observations fibers mediating pupillary constriction near reflex follow ventral course subserving light reflex mesencephalic level
afferent pupillary defect marcus gunn mg sign virtually diagnostic lesion times asymptomatic prechiasmal portion ipsilateral optic nerve
rarely occurs visual loss resulting impairment cornea lens vitreous retina

evaluating mg sign certain check patient relatively dark room bright hand light
dim light source produces insignificant pupillary movements bright light source causes afterimages keep pupil small several seconds obscuring pupillary escape eye
patient must continually urged fixate afar avoid convergence induced miosis
examiner shines bright light one patient eyes observes speed extent contraction quickly moves light pupil makes observations
difference pupillary reactions light may enhanced swinging flashlight back forth one eye
light remain seconds eye pupil stabilized
leave light one eye longer since create exaggerate relative afferent defect eye longer light exposure
light falls eye look carefully pupillary movement
normally initial constriction followed several seconds later slow redilatation
patient profoundly positive mg sign initial pupillary movement dilatation rather constriction
small afferent pupillary defects relatively brief constriction pupil escapes
asymmetric pupillary escape differentiates subtle mg sign
positive mg sign commonly signals presence ipsilateral optic nerve lesion may also occur homonymous visual loss related optic tract lesion
partial optic tract lesions cause asymmetric incongruous homonymous hemianopia
mg sign seen eye greater amount field loss
since one working iris sphincter required mg test search performed presence ipsilateral corneal opacity third nerve palsy atropinized pupil
examiner observes behavior intact pupil eye alternately illuminated

pupillary response light remains reliable way differentiating two acute conditions
term pupillary sparing requires careful definition

pupillary reactivity partial ptosis andor partial ophthalmoparesis constitute true pupillary sparing

tumorous aneurysmal compression third nerve variably affects pupil size depending location lesion

two pharmacologic tests may applied patients horner syndrome
cocaine prevents presynaptic reuptake norepinephrine sympathetic neuromuscular junction pupillodilator muscle
dilate pupil entire sympathetic pathway intact norepinephrine tonically released
sympathetic damage reduces availability norepinephrine myoneural junction horner pupil may dilate extent normal pupil
paredrine solution hydroxyamphetamine stimulates norepinephrine release myoneural junction inducing pupillary dilation
third order neurons produce transport store norepinephrine
third order neurons superior cervical ganglion postganglionic fibers damaged paredrine produces little pupillary dilation affected eye
however lesions sympathetic pathway proximal superior cervical ganglion pupil dilates response paredrine adequate amounts norepinephrine available release
thus cocaine test helps differentiate horner syndrome causes anisocoria paredrine test distinguish third order neuron horner syndrome first second neuron syndromes
