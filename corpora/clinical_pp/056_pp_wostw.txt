normal state consciousness comprises either state wakefulness awareness alertness human beings function asleep one recognized stages normal sleep person readily awakened
abnormal state consciousness difficult define characterize evidenced many terms applied altered states consciousness various observers
among terms clouding consciousness confusional state delirium lethargy obtundation stupor dementia hypersomnia vegetative state akinetic mutism locked syndrome coma brain death
many terms mean different things different people may prove inaccurate transmitting recording information regarding state consciousness patient
nevertheless appropriate define several terms closely possible
clouding consciousness mild form altered mental status patient inattention reduced wakefulness
confusional state profound deficit includes disorientation bewilderment difficulty following commands
lethargy consists severe drowsiness patient aroused moderate stimuli drift back sleep
obtundation state similar lethargy patient lessened interest environment slowed responses stimulation tends sleep normal drowsiness sleep states
stupor means vigorous repeated stimuli arouse individual left undisturbed patient immediately lapse back unresponsive state
coma state unarousable unresponsiveness
helpful standard scale one measure levels consciousness
proves advantageous several reasons communication among health care personnel neurologic condition patient improved guidelines diagnostic therapeutic intervention certain situations linked level consciousness situations rough estimate prognosis made based partly scale score
order scale useful must simple learn understand implement
scoring must reproducible among observers
grady coma scale table
proved functional regard
used years grady memorial hospital atlanta georgia gauge level consciousness patients neurosurgical intensive care unit elsewhere
grade patient slightly confused
grade ii patient requires light pain stimulus sharp pin tapped lightly chest wall appropriate arousal may combative belligerent
grade iii patient comatose ward deeply painful stimuli sternal pressure nipple twist appropriate response
grade iv patient reacts inappropriately either decorticate decerebrate posturing deeply painful stimuli grade v patient remains flaccid similarly stimulated
many coma scales developed
tailored specific subsets patients designed reflect level consciousness also include additional data reliable comparisons made research purposes reliable prognostic determinations made

technique evaluation patient altered level consciousness divided three phases
first determine level consciousness
second evaluation patient searching carefully hints cause confusion coma
third presence absence focality disorder terms level dysfunction within rostrocaudal neuraxis specific involvement cortical brainstem structures
physician makes sure immediate life threatening emergency airway obstruction shock present examination begins observation patient
position patient
patient one extremities positioned unusual manner might suggest paralysis spasticity
eyes opened closed
person acknowledge presence oblivious
patient alert acknowledges presence examiner seems well oriented time place confused general questioning level consciousness would considered normal
thus one normal level consciousness yet subnormal intellectual capability focal neurologic deficit aphasia hemiparesis exhibit abnormal thought content schizophrenic patient might
patient name called normal tone voice attempt simple conversation noted person confused drowsy indifferent abnormal level consciousness exists
individuals respond recognition name called lapse sleep left undisturbed said grade coma
alteration level consciousness severe person lapses sleep disturbed arousable pin tapped gently chest wall grade coma ii
category also includes patient organically disoriented belligerent uncooperative seen various states intoxication young adult moderately severe head injury
efforts calling patient name normal tone voice pricking skin chest wall lightly pin result response examiner must choose deeper pain stimulus
preference pinch slight twist nipple
options include sternal pressure may applied fisted knuckle squeezing nailbed
slight periareolar bruising repetitive nipple twisting much less problematic eventually recovered patient chronically painful subperiosteal subungual hemorrhage latter options
circumstances one apply painful stimulus irrigation ears ice water status intracranial pressure known
patient response deep pain stimulus noted
patient winces andor attempts ward deep pain stimulus appropriately said grade iii coma
deep pain stimulus may however result abnormal postural reflexes either unilateral bilateral
two common decorticate decerebrate posturing
states lower extremity exhibits extension knee internal rotation plantar flexion ankle
decorticate posturing upper extremity held adducted shoulder flexed elbow wrist metacarpal phalangeal joints
decerebrate state upper extremity adducted shoulder rigidly extended internally rotated elbow
either case patient exhibiting posturing deep pain stimulus rated grade iv coma
patient maintains state flaccid unresponsiveness despite deep pain stimulation grade v coma
level consciousness determined careful check hints cause alteration level consciousness undertaken
instances history obtained patient accompany available medical records valuable examination
history always available however instances careful examination merited
vital signs may obviously suggest infection hypertension shock increased intracranial pressure bradycardia
evidence trauma head elsewhere
inspect scalp thoroughly abrasions contusions blood seen explain even means shaving part scalp
periorbital retroauricular ecchymosis blood behind tympanic membrane suggest basilar skull fracture
papilledema intraocular hemorrhage
conjunctiva icteric liver enlarged patient asterixis
lips nailbeds discolored pale suggest anemia pulmonary dysfunction
neck stiffa warning meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage
anything suggest intoxication drugs poisons unusual odor breath body pinpoint pupils
next step try localize problem resulting alteration consciousness first trying localize dysfunction level within rostrocaudal neuraxis second searching focal clues specific cranial nerve deficits abnormal reflexes motor asymmetry
level consciousness determines certain extent level functional disturbance within neuraxis
patient qualifies grade ii cortical diencephalic dysfunction
grade iii patient physiologic dysfunction midbrain
grade iv coma indicates dysfunction levels cerebral peduncles pons grade v coma medulla may working
observation pattern respiration may support examiner impression dysfunctional level table
cheyne stokes respiration means trouble diencephalon central neurogenic hyperventilation rare points difficulty upper midbrain apneustic respiration suggests functional pontine deficit ataxic breathing pattern suggests dorso medial medullary dysfunction
observation rate pattern depth respiration least several minutes necessary document alterations
like respiratory patterns size reactivity pupils used substantiate level dysfunction within neuraxis table
small reactive pupils suggest diencephalic localization frequently metabolic basis
large pupils dilate contract automatically hippus react direct light stimulus suggest tectal lesion
midposition fixed pupils localize midbrain
bilateral pinpoint pupils indicative pontine trouble
examination called brainstem reflexes utmost importance evaluation patient grade iii iv v coma table
rely integrity centers within pons dorsal midbrain

irrigation eardrum ice water causes pain patient valsalva response may enough initiate herniation already tenuous situation markedly increased intracranial pressure
suggested methods testing reflexes outlined table
examination may productive revealing findings unilateral dilated pupil focal cranial nerve deficit asymmetry movement suggesting hemiparesis abnormal movements suggesting seizure activity reflex asymmetry focal sensory abnormality help localize area trouble within central nervous system
specific techniques examination covered elsewhere
exact neuronal connections modulate alertness wakefulness normal sleep drowsiness well defined
distinct group neurons reticular formation located periventricular areas midbrain pons medulla
addition modulating various interconnecting pathways within brainstem group neurons relates levels alertness wakefulness
postulated diffuse group neuronal connections emanates reticular formation projecting midbrain thalamic structures cortex
system referred ascending reticular activating system aras
aras receives input sensory systems efferent connections extensive
thought system responsible modulating alertness sleep
interruption system could result alteration level consciousness abnormalities sleep cycle
mechanisms producing dysfunction aras arc varied strongly dependent etiology illness
instances may one factor contributing deterioration level consciousness
instance metabolic toxic diseases generally produce stupor coma affecting neuronal metabolism altering neuronal transmission
situations dysfunction generally occurs orderly rostrocaudal fashion beginning cortical dysfunction sequentially involving diencephalon midbrain pons medulla progression characteristic induction maintenance general anesthesia
early involvement cortex seizures abnormal movement patterns cortically modulated myoclonus occur
unusual supratentorial mass lesion result significant alteration level consciousness unless quite large involves hemispheres
instead progressive stupor coma lesion attributed separate physiologic process brainstem level secondary effects brainstem shifts herniations
example former would association posttraumatic supratentorial subdural hematoma axonal stretch tearing brainstem level
latter best exemplified brief description transtentorial herniation consequences
supratentorial mass lesion becomes large enough displace medial aspect temporal lobe tentorial edge patient may acquire ipsilateral partial third nerve palsy characterized pupillary dilation ptosis possibly homonymous hemianopsia occipital ischemia due compression ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery tentorial edge
brainstem twisted contorted within tentorial hiatus small areas hemorrhage ischemia may develop within resulting alterations level consciousness
mass lesions within brainstem produce coma virtue direct effects reticular formation
cerebellar lesions cause coma secondary brainstem compression
times evaluating patient alteration level consciousness clinician must keep foremost mind common causes coma
leading list various metabolic toxic disturbances brain acid base disequilibrium disorders oxygen glucose metabolism uremic hepatic encephalopathy drug overdose poison ingestion
epilepsy various postconvulsive states present altered consciousness
cerebrovascular disorders ischemic embolic stroke intracerebral subarachnoid hemorrhage also common causes stupor coma
infection meningitis cerebral abscess encephalitis culprit
intracranial sequelae head injury frequently result alteration consciousness brain tumors either primary metastatic
occasion two etiologies may operating instance alcoholic presents grade ii coma elevated blood alcohol level subdural hematoma
consequently history important diagnosis causes altered levels consciousness
knowledge temporal course sequence symptom evolution presence associated disease states helpful
taking systematic approach evaluation confused obtunded comatose patient much inferred regarding possible etiologies
first one determines level coma searches physical signs might point causes localizes level dysfunction within neuraxis
information gathered assessment serve tailor subsequent diagnostic therapeutic steps
