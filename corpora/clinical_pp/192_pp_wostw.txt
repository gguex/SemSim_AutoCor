urea creatinine nitrogenous end products metabolism
urea primary metabolite derived dietary protein tissue protein turnover
creatinine product muscle creatine catabolism
relatively small molecules daltons respectively distribute throughout total body water

multiple methods analysis bun creatinine evolved years
current use automated give clinically reliable reproducible results
two general methods measurement urea nitrogen
diacetyl fearon reaction develops yellow chromogen urea quantified photometry
modified use autoanalyzers generally gives relatively accurate results
still limited specificity however illustrated spurious elevations sulfonylurea compounds colorimetric interference hemoglobin whole blood used
specific enzymatic methods enzyme urease converts urea ammonia carbonic acid
products proportional concentration urea sample assayed variety systems automated
one system checks decrease absorbance mm ammonia reacts alpha ketoglutaric acid
astra system measures rate increase conductivity solution urea hydrolyzed
even though test performed mostly serum term bun still retained convention
specimen collected tubes containing sodium fluoride fluoride inhibits urease
also chloral hydrate guanethidine observed increase bun values
jaffé reaction creatinine treated alkaline picrate solution yield red complex still basis commonly used methods measuring creatinine
reaction nonspecific subject interference many noncreatinine chromogens including acetone acetoacetate pyruvate ascorbic acid glucose cephalosporins barbiturates protein
also sensitive ph temperature changes
one another many modifications designed nullify sources error used clinical laboratories today
example recent kinetic rate modification isolates brief time interval true creatinine contributes total color formation basis astra modular system
specific non jaffé assays also developed
one automated dry slide enzymatic method measures ammonia generated creatinine hydrolyzed creatinine iminohydrolase
simplicity precision speed highly recommend routine use clinical laboratory
fluorocytosine interferes significantly test
creatinine must determined plasma serum whole blood erythrocytes contain considerable amounts noncreatinine chromogens
minimize conversion creatine creatinine specimens must fresh possible maintained ph storage
urea synthesis occurs liver
primary source dietary protein
gut protein converted peptides amino acids absorbed carried liver
hepatocyte amino acids deaminated transaminated
resulting excess nitrogen feeds urea cycle incorporated urea
protein moieties escaping absorption small bowel plus recycled urea converted ammonia gut flora predominantly colon
ammonia diffuses portal circulation liver enter urea cycle figure
amount urea produced varies substrate delivery liver adequacy liver function
increased high protein diet gastrointestinal bleeding based plasma protein level
gdl hemoglobin gdl ml whole blood equivalent g protein catabolic processes fever infection antianabolic drugs tetracyclines except doxycycline glucocorticoids
decreased low protein diet malnutrition starvation impaired metabolic activity liver due parenchymal liver disease rarely congenital deficiency urea cycle enzymes
normal subject g protein diet produces g urea day
newly synthesized urea distributes throughout total body water
recycled enterohepatic circulation
usually small amount less
gday lost gastrointestinal tract lungs skin exercise substantial fraction may excreted sweat
bulk urea gm day excreted kidney process begins glomerular filtration
high urine flow rates greater mlmin filtered load reabsorbed flow rates lower mlmin reabsorption may increase
low flow urinary tract obstruction allows time reabsorption often associated increases antidiuretic hormone adh increases permeability terminal collecting tubule urea
adh induced antidiuresis urea secretion contributes intratubular concentration urea
subsequent buildup urea inner medulla critical process urinary concentration
reabsorption also increased volume contraction reduced renal plasma flow congestive heart failure decreased glomerular filtration
creatinine formation begins transamidination arginine glycine form glycocyamine guanidoacetic acid gaa
reaction occurs primarily kidneys also mucosa small intestine pancreas
gaa transported liver methylated adenosyl methionine sam form creatine
creatine enters circulation taken stored muscle tissue
reaction catalyzed creatine phosphokinase cpk muscle creatine phosphorylated creatine phosphate
day stores converted nonenzymatically irreversibly creatinine figure
thus creatinine production essentially reflects lean body mass
mass changes little day day production rate fairly constant
absolute creatinine production declines age line decreasing muscle mass
unlike urea creatinine largely unaffected gastrointestinal bleeding catabolic factors fever steroids
however ingestion cooked meat raise scr cooking converts creatine meat creatinine
certain drugs notably psychoactive phenacemide increase production rate
like urea creatinine distributes throughout total body water
concentration serum function usually constant production excretion rates
may slightly higher evening morning due likely dietary meat intake day
normal subjects creatinine excreted primarily kidneys
minimal extrarenal disposal demonstrable metabolism
small molecule molecular weight daltons freely filtered glomerulus
unlike urea reabsorbed affected urine flow rate
normally secreted tubules small significant amount total excretion
excretion urea creatinine increased exercise without producing significant change serum concentration
total creatinine excretion normal man averages mgkgday normal woman mgkgday
excretion declines age mgkgday year old man
however vary given individual
amount excreted used rough index completeness daily urine collection
measurement urine creatinine excretion used calculating creatinine clearance ccr
short precise technically impractical inulin clearance ccr standard clinical tool estimating gfr especially early stages renal disease
setting scr bun useful indices gfr due parabolic relationship wide range normal figure
contrast ccr major disadvantage inaccuracies urine collection especially short term clearances patients low urine volumes
reason hour clearances preferred general use usually larger volumes minimize errors collection
concentration creatinine serum urine determined careful attention units measurement ccr calculated follows
ucr urine creatinine concentration mgdl v urine volume mlmin scr serum creatinine concentration mgdl
result may standardized
body surface area bsa
subject bsa related weight height usually obtained nomogram
example
several shortcuts estimate ccr without collecting urine proposed
earliest probably least accurate ignores subject age weight simply divides scr
cockcroft gault formula one usually recommended use calculating dosage drugs especially nephrotoxic antibiotics
takes account well documented fall grf age follows
advanced renal failure net creatinine excretion decreases significantly
even though tubular secretion increases gfr falls compensate decrease filtration gfr mlmin
measurable creatinine metabolism gut flora patients decreased creatinine synthesis
thus ccr unreliable often overestimates gfr chronic renal failure cirrhosis
suggested gfr mlmin mean ccr plus urea clearance gives accurate index gfr
thus
certain drugs may affect ccr without changing gfr
salicylates cimetidine trimethoprim interfere tubular secretion creatinine cause spuriously low ccr
bun scr screening tests renal function
handled primarily glomerular filtration little renal regulation adaptation course declining renal function essentially reflect gfr
unfortunately relation grf straight line rather parabolic curve figure
values remain within normal range renal function lost
within range however doubling values e g bun rising mgdl scr
mgdl may mean fall gfr
therefore early stages renal disease tests could create false sense security
random values midrange normal corroborated normal ccr one confidently tell patient kidney function normal
end curve small changes kidney function produce large increments bun scr
tests generally adequate follow patient course
indeed reciprocal scr plotted time shows straight line progression renal disease individual patient used predict advent end stage renal disease

bun mgdl instead clinician begin search extrarenal factors table
note ratio applies best moderate advanced renal failure
attention reversible complications uremia give patient reprieve untimely sentence end stage renal disease
low buncr ratio suggests inadequate protein intake reduced urea synthesis advanced liver disease supernormal excretion urea sickle cell anemia increased creatinine production rhabdomyolysis effective removal urea creatinine dialysis
bun survives finding wide application nutritional management critically ill patients
urea nitrogen appearance una objectively lets intensivist know whether patient nitrogen needs met
una assessment requires measurement bun beginning end period observation well total urea excretion
bun creatinine taken together valuable screening tests evaluating renal disease
though may fall short absolute indicators renal function given point time useful following progression disease
