hemoglobin hb protein contained red blood cells responsible delivery oxygen tissues
ensure adequate tissue oxygenation sufficient hemoglobin level must maintained
amount hemoglobin whole blood expressed grams per deciliter gdl
normal hb level males gdl females gdl
hemoglobin level low patient anemia
erythrocytosis consequence many red cells results hemoglobin levels normal
hematocrit measures volume red blood cells compared total blood volume red blood cells plasma
normal hematocrit men women
value determined directly microhematocrit centrifugation calculated indirectly
automated cell counters calculate hematocrit multiplying red cell number millionsmm mean cell volume mcv femtoliters

hemoglobin hematocrit based whole blood therefore dependent plasma volume
patient severely dehydrated hemoglobin hematocrit appear higher patient normovolemic patient fluid overloaded lower actual level
assess true red cell mass independent radionuclide evaluation red cells plasma cr respectively must performed
hematocrit must determined quickly often case patient hemorrhages may necessary measure hematocrit directly without use automated counter
materials needed
lancets alcohol prep pads gauze pads microhematocrit tubes heparinized sealant seal ease crit seal etc microhematocrit centrifuge microhematocrit reader venipuncture required tourniquet syringe tube containing anticoagulant edta citrate
hematocrits obtained fingerstick wipe fingertip pad fourth finger nondominant hand alcohol prep pad
make certain area allowed dry
prick fingertip lancet
place hematocrit tube near incision site allow blood flow via capillary action hematocrit tube two thirds three fourths full predesignated mark tube
avoid milking finger possible causes expression tissue fluids may result falsely low hematocrit
always fill least three tubes
hematocrits obtained venipuncture draw sample blood tube containing anticoagulant mix well
dip hematocrit tube blood allow blood rise desired two thirds three quarters level
blood cells naturally sediment prior thorough mixing blood tube necessary ensure accurate reading
cleaning outside hematocrit tubes excess blood invert tube slowly blood migrates short bottom end tube
seal bottom tube sealant
make certain little air interspersed column blood
seal incomplete leakage occur centrifugation false readings obtained
place tubes microhematocrit centrifuge spin minutes high speed
shorter spin allow complete sedimentation
using either hematocrit reader ruled apparatus measure length column packed red cells divide length whole column blood cells plasma figure
obtain hematocrit multiply number
average readings obtained different microhematocrit tubes
example column packed red cells measures mm whole blood column measures mm hematocrit

hemoglobin determinations usually performed automated cell counter tube well mixed edta anticoagulated blood filled predetermined level
assay forms hemoglobins converted colored protein cyanomethemoglobin measured colorimeter
inadequate sample whether due insufficient volume inadequate anticoagulation may give false readings
necessary determine level anemia quickly hematocrit easier convenient test
hemoglobin electrophoresis measures mobility hemoglobin electric field therefore detect abnormalities hemoglobin alter charge
electrophoretic mobilities affected ph medium test conducted
screening tests typically use hemolysate anticoagulated blood electrophoresed cellulose acetate ph
necessary electrophoresis starch gel ph

stage work usually performed specialized laboratory
hemoglobin electrophoresis readily assess situations neutral amino acid substitutions hemoglobin normal constituent chains produced equal numbers thalassemias
diagnosis alpha thalassemia mild moderate degree made hemoglobin electrophoresis diagnosis beta thalassemia may made inference increase hb
standard electrophoresis would look like figure
molecular weight hemoglobin approximately daltons
hb composed two pairs dissimilar chains b defined specific amino acid sequence incorporating iron containing heme group
two b dimers combine form hemoglobin tetramer
allows heme heme interaction necessary effective oxygen uptake deoxyhemoglobin oxyhemoglobin delivery oxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin
oxygen affinity hemoglobin function heme heme interaction ph bohr effect measure many hemoglobin molecules oxygen bound given level oxygen tension
normal individual major hemoglobin hb constituting approximately total hemoglobin
variations andor amino acid substitutions chains exist
deleterious normal function hemoglobin whereas others may relatively normal oxygen affinity stability
hemoglobins containing different types chains make remainder hemoglobin content red cells ad hb approximately ag hb f approximately
substitutions normal hemoglobin amino acid sequence may result hemoglobins different sub unit interactions varying affinities oxygen
example substitution sixth amino acid beta chain causes hb sickle hemoglobin
hb lower oxygen affinity surrenders oxygen readily
hb f normal minor hemoglobin constituent higher oxygen affinity
oxygen dissociation curve abnormal body adjust hemoglobin level ensure adequate oxygen distribution tissues
thus rare disease like hemoglobin hotel dieu difficulty extracting oxygen variant hemoglobin increased oxygen affinity could result lack oxygen tissues tissue hypoxia compensatory erythrocytosis
smaller fraction oxygen released hemoglobin thereby offset increased number hemoglobin molecules
similarly sickle cell anemia decreased oxygen affinity allows patients tissue oxygen given hemoglobin level
many anemias detected routine laboratory screening performed patient symptomatic
patient symptoms abnormality hemoglobin level symptoms often nonspecific weakness fatigue
finding physical examination may pallor additional changes nail beds spooning glossitis red tongue hepatosplenomegaly enlarged liver spleen may give clue etiology anemia
symptoms usually related level hemoglobin abruptness onset duration
patient pernicious anemia may feel well level hemoglobin would cause severe weakness patient acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage
due volume compensation plasma shifts oxygen dissociation curve occur time
