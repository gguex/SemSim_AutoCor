pain pressure tightness discomfort originating radiating chest constitutes important indicator potentially serious cardiac cardiovascular disorders
chest pain one common symptoms adults seek care physician
probable etiology often determined history alone clinician systematically evaluate characteristics pain
precise definition pain allows list possible causes narrowed guides physical examination choice diagnostic tests
central goal determine whether pain likely caused myocardial ischemia
coronary arteriography studies demonstrated patients pain typical angina pectoris likely obstructive coronary disease patients atypical pain syndromes
angina pectoris recognizable pain syndrome careful attention features history aids clinician determining whether patient pain typical angina pectoris
patients asked describe quality discomfort words
anginal pain typically described dull heavy crushing
patient may describe pressure sensation rather true pain
sharp stabbing burning pain less typical angina
anginal pain usually located substernally across anterior chest
pain located exclusively either left right chest atypical
radiation pain left arm typical angina patients coronary artery disease also frequently pain radiates right arm neck
important part chest pain history define aggravates relieves pain
angina usually becomes worse exertion relieved rest
patient notes less exertion required cause pain going cold weather eating large meal pain likely caused coronary artery disease
patients coronary disease frequently report pain brought emotional stress sexual intercourse
pain pleuritic brought moving arms torso less likely caused coronary disease
patients occasionally attribute pain exertion careful questioning reveal pain comes goes deep breaths body movements heavy exercise
pain usually caused coronary artery disease
patients reporting chest pain brought exertion clarify amount exertion required cause pain
patients history recurrent pain occurs decreasing levels exertion may require urgent treatment
similarly improving exercise tolerance strong evidence treatment regimen effective
whether pain caused exertion severity provides clue etiology
pain caused coronary disease likely require patients stop usual activities
frequency duration pain defined although data less helpful distinguishing cause attacks
episodes pain caused coronary disease usually last less hour
coronary disease rarely causes episodes lasting hours without electrocardiographic changes acute myocardial infarction
symptoms accompanying chest pain often provide diagnostic clues
cough dyspnea suggests pulmonary disorders
diaphoresis frequently occurs acute myocardial infarction
dysphagia nausea vomiting suggest gastrointestinal etiology
patient asked describe temporal relationship pain associated symptoms
accompanying symptoms helpful diagnostically occur close proximity episodes pain
surprisingly patients history myocardial infarction likely found coronary disease cause recurrent episodes pain
conditions asked include valvular rheumatic heart disease hypertension peptic disorders esophageal disorders achalasia rheumatologic disease chronic lung disease hyperventilation syndrome anxiety states
pain may originate several different structures within chest including skin ribs intercostal muscles pleura esophagus heart aorta diaphragm thoracic vertebrae
pain may transmitted intercostal sympathetic vagus phrenic nerves
innervations deep structures thorax follow common pathways central nervous system making difficult localize source pain
pursuing cause chest pain probabilistic approach diagnosis aid making decisions patients
indicated chapter clinician estimate probability particular diagnosis particular patient
several studies coronary arteriography patients referred evaluation recurrent chest pain quantified prevalance coronary artery disease different chest pain syndromes
studies found patients typical exertional angina significant anatomic coronary disease
patients atypical angina prevalence coronary disease prevalence patients nonanginal pain
prevalence figures interpreted caution however
arteriography studies consistently shown women lower prevalance coronary disease men
coronary artery surgery study men typical angina pectoris prevalance significant coronary disease whereas women typical angina prevalence
furthermore prevalence coronary artery disease strongly influenced age
men risk coronary disease increases steadily ages little increase age
women risk rises gradually age increases rapidly ages
arteriography studies reported disease prevalances patients evaluated referral centers selected populations higher prevalance coronary disease general population
study reported sox et al
patients met specific criteria nonischemic chest pain followed determine cause pain
none patents seen walk clinic evidence ischemic heart disease follow
clinicians attempt estimate underlying rates disease clinical settings interpreting patient disease risk
several studies provided data estimating risk coronary artery disease less investigation prevalance disease patients chest pain
patients whose recurrent chest pain caused coronary artery disease approximately half reflux esophagitis esophageal contraction abnormalities
possible etiologies include chest wall disorders hyperventilation pulmonary disease relatively common populations
various schemes used classify etiologies chest pain useful distinguish acute chronic patterns pain
patients acute pain include whose episodes recent onset recent increase intensity frequency recurrent pain
patients chronic pain include recurrent episodes pain occurring relatively stable pattern
leading diagnostic consideration patients chronic chest pain coronary artery disease
commonest clinical presentation coronary artery disease recurrent angina pectoris
helpful diagnostic feature coronary artery disease pain usually improves specific medications
relief anginal pain within minutes taking sublingual nitroglycerin strong evidence coronary disease caused pain
decreased frequency attacks starting beta blocker calcium channel blocker long acting nitrate preparation suggests coronary artery disease cause
esophageal disease common cause recurrent chest pain
esophagitis usually secondary acid reflux stomach frequently causes esophageal pain
acid causes chemical damage inflammation mucosa resulting pain often burning quality
clues presence reflux esophagitis include history acid peptic disease symptoms reflux regurgitation acid taste mouth
chest pain caused esophageal reflux tends occur meals may related body position
episodes pain induced bending waist
often occur night recumbent posture enhances reflux acid esophagus
relief pain antacids topical lidocaine specific maneuvers reduce reflux suggests diagnosis
esophageal motor disorders also commonly cause chest pain
reflux esophagitis causes pain irritation esophageal mucosa motor disorders cause pain contraction spasm muscular wall esophagus
esophageal spasm often occurs secondary manifestation reflux esophagitis
mucosal irritation inflammation become severe stimulation local nerves leads muscular spasm
patients report pattern pain similar seen reflux esophagitis occurring meals aggravated body position
patients may report varying qualities pain
episodes simple mucosal irritation pain may reported heartburn pain reported severe heavy quality episodes muscular spasm
esophageal motor disorders independent acid reflux disease patients achalasia diffuse esophageal spasm
patients show different pattern episodes occurs patients acid reflux
pain usually unrelated body position may occur eating instead meals
dysphagia frequently prominent symptom patients primary motor disorders
esophageal motor disorders may relieved nitrates calcium channel blockers via relaxation smooth muscle wall esophagus
agents also relieve chest pain caused coronary artery disease clinician may difficulty using medication response clue cause undiagnosed chest pain
clinician must carefully interpret results therapeutic trial particularly rapidity response
relief pain within minutes sublingual dose nitroglycerin consistent coronary artery disease esophageal motor disorders
relief occurs minutes esophageal disease likely
nitrates calcium channel blockers relax lower esophogeal sphincter aggravate esophageal reflux thereby increasing symptoms reflux esophagitis
myocardial ischemia sometimes occurs absence fixed obstructions coronary arteries resulting recurrent chest pain
obstructive disease intramural small vessels cause ischemia
although lesions occur frequently diabetics small vessel disease infrequent cause chest pain
considered likely etiologies excluded
valvular aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy thyrotoxicosis also cause myocardial ischemia
quality pattern pain conditions usually similar coronary artery disease
entities nearly always accompanied physical examination findings typical underlying disease detection usually difficult
coronary vasospasm cause myocardial ischemia absence obstructive coronary disease
pain usually quality similar pain obstructive coronary disease tends occur unpredictable pattern
pain typically induced exertion may awaken patient sleep
patients report emotional stress trigger
pain frequently responds sublingual nitroglycerin frequency episodes decreases therapy calcium channel blockers long acting nitrates
approximately patients coronary vasospasm ecg changes episodes pain
thus absence electrocardiographic changes pain makes coronary vasospasm unlikely
mitral valve prolapse mvp controversial etiology chronic chest pain
clinical echocardiographic studies demonstrated mvp common finding otherwise healthy adults
population studies found incidence chest pain higher individuals mitral valve prolapse without disorder
nevertheless numerous clinical reports patients mitral valve prolapse identifiable etiology recurrent chest pain
patients studies pain various qualities patterns typical chest pain syndrome mvp
considered cause recurrent chest pain likely causes excluded since specific treatment disorder
major value diagnosing mitral valve prolapse identify patients risk endocarditis arrhythmias
prospective studies shown patients develop serious complications either late systolic murmur abnormal electrocardiogram conjunction midsystolic click
thus unnecessary obtain echocardiography exclude mitral valve prolapse unless patient findings physical examination andor electrocardiogram suggest risk complications
chest wall cause recurrent chest pain clinical diagnosis chest wall syndromes described well
quality location chest wall pain vary greatly precipitating factors useful diagnosis
chest wall pain often pleuritic tends aggravated moving arms torso
patients pain reproduced palpation manipulation chest wall
clinician must make immediate management decisions patients new onset chest pain increase frequency severity recurrent chest pain
disorders life threatening must decided whether admit patient
often option assess response therapeutic interventions patients
systematic approach management essential
leading diagnostic consideration acute chest pain myocardial infarction life threatening condition requiring immediate medical management
pain myocardial infarction similar quality location angina pectoris although usually intense severe longer lasting
pain often occurs rest relieved nitroglycerin
may accompanied diaphoresis dyspnea nausea
initial electrocardiogram shows new q waves st segment elevations patients absence findings exclude infarction
patients suspected myocardial infarction usually require hospital admission
syndrome unstable angina pectoris includes diverse group patients chest pain due coronary artery disease
patients unstable angina short term risk myocardial infarction therapeutic interventions shown reduce risk
syndrome includes patients new onset angina pectoris
patients exertional pain relieved rest sublingual nitroglycerin
syndrome also includes patients stable exertional pain changing pain pattern
patients report pain occurring lower level exertion rest
nitroglycerin may longer provide relief
various pathophysiologic mechanisms may responsible unstable angina
common mechanism progression severity atherosclerotic disease
vasospasm aggravating atherosclerotic disease also cause unstable angina pectoris
important cause unstable angina patients prior stable angina alteration patient medication
patient may misunderstand physician prescribed regimen patient may compliant regimen
nitroglycerin become outdated ineffective
careful review patient medications provide clues
difficult differentiate unstable angina acute myocardial infarction
hospitalization often required clarify diagnosis facilitate treatment interventions
serial electrocardiograms cardiac enzymes confirm exclude myocardial infarction
infarction excluded patient response medications carefully evaluated
pain episodes improve substantially cardiac medications patient either refractory coronary artery disease preinfarction angina another cause pain
thus diagnostic evaluation imaging studies coronary arteriography may necessary
dissection thoracic aorta serious potentially catastrophic cause acute chest pain
dissection requires immediate specific treatment clinician must exclude diagnosis early
two primary types dissection different clinical presentations
proximal dissections arise ascending aorta sometimes extend beyond aortic arch
nearly patients proximal dissection pain anterior chest approximately half report radiation posterior chest
approximately two thirds evidence previous hypertension
pulse deficits murmur aortic regurgitation neurologic deficits physical examination important considering diagnosis
distal dissection thoracic aorta arises descending aorta great vessels
occurs predominantly men older age history hypertension group also risk acute myocardial infarction
nearly patients acute myocardial infarction anterior chest pain majority patients distal dissection posterior chest pain
pain distal dissection may described tearing ripping improve nitroglycerin
physical findings less frequent distal proximal dissection diagnosis distal dissection may subtle considered patients histories hypertension hypertensive time pain atypical pain
radiographic studies aorta may necessary exclude diagnosis
pericarditis moderately common disorder chest pain frequent symptom
many causes pericarditis
pain often retrosternal may radiate left arm suggesting ischemic etiology
pain usually pleuritic affected body position however aggravated lying relieved sitting
pericardial friction rub suggests diagnosis rub may absent
electrocardiogram show st elevations multiple leads finding may confused acute myocardial infarction
patients pericarditis ecg changes uremic pericarditis notable absence ecg findings
chest x rays often show normal cardiac silhouette
diverse presentation pericarditis difficult exclude routine clinical examination diagnosis suspected patient likely causes pain clinical evidence precipitating cause
pneumonia pneumothorax also cause acute chest pain disorders usually easy diagnose
pain characteristically unilaterial pleuritic
chest x ray establish diagnosis
difficult diagnostic problem hyperventilation
hyperventilation cause pain atypical angina pectoris
may vary location may pleuritic
useful clue pain often brought anxiety emotions
useful tool confirming hyperventilation demonstrate pain reproduced rapid breathing
