intermediate nerve composed contributions three areas
superior salivary nucleus pons supplies secretory fibers
go lacrimal nasal palatine glands via greater superficial petrosal nerve b submandibular sublingual salivary glands via chorda tympani nerve
gustatory solitary nucleus medulla supplies sensory fibers

idiopathic bell palsy may strike age often mild viral illness

cause idiopathic variety unknown
sequelae bell palsy include following
interfacial synkinesis eyes close mouth twitch
occurs regenerating nerve fibers grow back proper muscles
synkinetic movements almost always present involved side
contractures face rest may deeply etched side previous palsy

causes peripheral seventh nerve palsy include neoplasm trauma middle ear infections parotid gland surgery granulomatous carcinomatous meningitis diabetes
disturbances function produced lesions need complete
