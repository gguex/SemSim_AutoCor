rectal examination consists visual inspection perianal skin digital palpation rectum assessment neuromuscular function perineum
clinical situation experience examiner often dictate several methods employ performing rectal examination
lithotomy position patient supine legs drawn toward trunk knees allowed fall side
position customarily used examining pelvic organs women may offer better examination anterior rectum
lateral decubitus sim position provides optimal examination patient ill otherwise unable assume positions
patient lies left side buttocks near edge examining table bedside right knee hip slight flexion
proctologic knee chest prone jackknife position preferred position examine perineum rectum properly
position patient easily undergo studies anoscopy sigmoidoscopy easier access anorectum
regardless position used rectal examination involves inspection palpation
first using gloved hand examiner inspects buttocks fistulous tracts skin tags hemorrhoids excoriations blood rectal prolapse
patient asked bear check rectal prolapse proper descent perineum area thighs coccyx pubis
normal individuals perineum lies
cm ischial tuberosities
straining stool perineum descend approximately
cm level cm ischial tuberosities
next examiner applies firm pressure ischial tuberosities order evaluate early abscess fistual formation found inflammatory bowel disease
pressure still applied perineum patient asked bear order obtain evidence abscess fistula
next step rectal examination involves assessment neuromuscular integrity
first side buttocks scratched gloved finger elicit superficial anal reflex anal wink function l l
next using generous amount water soluble gel lubrication gloved index finger inserted gently rectum
patient consciously acts resist defecation analogous stopping midstream urination examiner evaluate anterior contraction puborectalis muscle contraction external anal sphincter
patient relaxes examiner pushes puborectalis muscle posteriorly noting relaxation internal anal sphincter
finally patient bears expelling examining finger causing puborectalis muscle move posteriorly internal anal sphincter relax
maneuver often permits palpation cervix women allows assessment tenderness organ
final step rectal examination assesses anatomic integrity digital palpation
gloved finger slipped gently rectum entire circumference rectum systematically palpated two stages
first stage involves area cm beyond external sphincter length fingerpad second stage deals remainder rectum within reach examining finger cm
attention given presence masses tenderness hemorrhoids fissures ulcers color consistency stool special emphasis posterior rectal shelf
men prostate size consistency presence nodules noted see chapter including assessment area rectovesicular pouch
women rectouterine pouch douglas palpated masses tenderness
bimanual examination rectoabdominal rectovaginal often facilitates examination lower abdomen genitourinary structures
rectum begins termination sigmoid colon cm anal verge figure
two muscle bundles known internal external anal sphincters participate defecation
internal anal sphincter enlargement circular smooth muscle colon functions involuntarily
external anal sphincter consists striated muscle bands voluntary control puborectalis muscle
rectum innervation bladder hypogastric nerves innervate internal anal sphincter internal pudendal nerve operates external anal sphincter
common innervation dysuria common complaint associated rectal disorders
important landmark anatomically clinically pectinate line anus rectum merge approximately cm skin
serves demarcation venous lymphatic drainage nerve supply
pectinate line veins drain portal caval systems sympathetic nerves present pain absent lymph drains superior rectal iliac nodes
pectinate line veins drain caval system alone innervation somatic nerves pain present lymph drains inguinal nodes
rectum functions permit defecation voluntary fashion
peristalsis propels stool sigmoid colon rectum
increased intraluminal pressure causes involuntary relaxation internal anal sphincter followed reflex contraction external anal sphincter preventing incontinence providing awareness imminent defecation
external anal sphincter relaxes voluntary fashion expelling feces
studies suggest evacuative process facilitated larger fecal bulk providing impetus encouraging patients consume diets high fiber bulk
major alluded long ago many otherwise puzzling clinical situations resolved rectal examination made
indeed history physical examination incomplete without rectal examination omitted
person abdominal complaints e g abdominal rectal pain diarrhea constipation nausea vomiting bleeding needs rectal examination direct diagnostic therapeutic maneuvers appropriately
although disagreement exists age often american cancer society recommends yearly rectal examination testing occult blood stool persons age screening procedure colorectal prostate carcinoma
inspection buttocks often provides clues many disorders including skin tags hemorrhoids fistulous tracts fissures patients inflammatory bowel disease rectal prolapse superficial ulcers caused herpes simplex syphilis
perianal skin may also affected generalized disorders including psoriasis vitiligo infective processes syphilitic dermatitis candidiasis
assessment neuromuscular function necessary many situations simple palpation external anal sphincter poor measure strength diagnose dysfunction
patients fecal incontinence often complain diarrhea anal canal unable handle normal volume stool sensation urge defecate inadequate
individuals often provide history traumatic childbirth surgical repair hemorrhoids subsequent disruption sphincter musculature innervation
upon examination descent perineum often much greater normal often dropping plane ischial tuberosities
addition fecal incontinence may first symptom serious systemic diseases neuropathies spinal cord tumors primary metastatic multiple sclerosis
palpation rectum reveal ulcers herpes syphilis inflammatory bowel disease well fistulae fissures seen inspection
diligent palpation rectum made determine presence masses colorectal cancers arise rectum organ may site metastatic disease well
masses neoplastic may abscesses
fluctuant consistency mass presence fever suggest abscess
tenderness one helpful signs rectal examination
location degree tenderness may provide additional convincing evidence disorders prostatitis pelvic inflammatory disease tubo ovarian abscesses ovarian cysts ectopic pregnancy inflammatory bowel disease
rectal tenderness suspected appendicitis touted important diagnostic clue weight evidence suggests finding little help
importance noting consistency color presence frank occult blood stool overemphasized
elderly patients without history chronic constipation may present diarrhea rectal examination discover due fecal impaction
black stools result degraded blood melena iron licorice bismuth rhubarb overindulgence chocolate cookies
red colored stools may due brisk bleeding known hematochezia usually distal ligament treitz whereas patients treatment tuberculosis may complain red orange colored stools due rifampin
one first symptoms hepatobiliary disease development tan stools dark urine
rarely patient carcinoma ampulla vater presents complaint silver stools
busy practitioners often omit rectal examination variety reasons
procedure allegedly takes much time causes discomfort patient aesthetically pleasing
many diseases however examination rectum point physician proper diagnostic direction
turn may obviate need expensive unnecessary laboratory andor radiologic evaluation
diligent conscientious thorough physician make rectal examination necessary part complete patient evaluation
anonymous quote relevant diagnoses needed ounce knowledge ounce intelligence pound thoroughness
many thanks drs
