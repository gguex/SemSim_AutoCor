gathering clinical data difficult elderly compared younger patients
dementia impaired hearing visual handicaps often limit communication
thus obtaining effective history demands increased skills time reliance family members caregivers medical records document presence absence current symptoms
patient decreased mobility physical examination may time consuming tedious frail elderly patient
although standard medical history physical examination pick many clinical problems common age groups medical specialities developed modified set questions specific needs problems patients
geriatric review systems geriros presented chapter modification standard review systems
designed screen elderly patients problems might interfere ability function independently
purpose identify problems might benefit rehabilitative interventions appropriate patient age services might better support patient andor family coping disabilities common elderly population
focuses following spheres function
general health status
mental health status
activities daily living
social support status
future outlook
family concerns
recommended student physician use geriros menu questions point medical interview initial questions pertaining presenting problem chief complaint completed
scanning questions used inquire additional symptoms information areas additional clues might modify physician understanding patient presenting problems
number scanning questions physician asks depends time available urgency patient problems physician intuitive sense likelihood obtaining additional pertinent information
noted barrows tamblyn advantages using routine questions
several times interview examination interviewer may confused patient problem
consequently may want time think already learned reshape definition patient problem rethink initial hypotheses presenting symptoms complaints
clinicians feel uncomfortable looking thinking yet difficult walk patient stop talking
instead without change external appearances many clinicians switch inventory know heart mouthed almost automatically listening patient answers allowing time ponder patient problems without detectable change behavior
kind activity often causes uninitiated observer physician patient interaction assume clinical medicine must art science
logic intermixed searching problem oriented searching nonroutine questions scanning routine questions may evident casual observer clinician pursues appropriate hypotheses mind
student physician feel obligated take interview formulated sequence
instead move one section another appropriate inquiry concerning patient problem
problem oriented inquiry search section interview proves inadequate leads blind alley may move scan section e g geriros time obtain cues ideas
skilled clinician moves back forth search scan section interview ease
problems identified physician may choose make initial intervention may choose refer patient consultant social worker occupational therapist physical therapist geriatric home health nurse geriatric evaluation clinic etc
community agency additional information services would helpful
recognized geriatric review systems primarily serves screen problems spheres function support
many methodologies evaluating problems detail developed extensively reviewed kane kane kane et al
menu questions geriatric review systems shown appendix
part patient profile represents data extracted chart obtained patient family member patient seen
basic demographic social information provide background data assess impact chronic disease patient social support network
medical screening question easily identifies status screening treatable common problems older persons
inquiry patient use community services provides physician information patient past experience formal support network elderly individuals
patients become frail may require assistance family community services order able continue living homes communities
use community services home health aides meals wheels etc measure ability become interdependent others without totally surrendering elements personal independence
remembered important factor underlying functional impairment elderly failure many persons seek assistance
studies several countries show symptoms serious treatable diseases often go unreported
health problems reported frail elderly persons thus frequently tip iceberg treatable illness
noted besdine nonreporting symptoms underlying disease elderly persons especially dangerous phenomenon system emphasize health promotion disease prevention
part ii geriros presents series questions maneuvers physician undertake patient
physicians must recognize many diseases elderly signs symptoms differ younger adults
one hand signs symptoms disease characteristic middle age may replaced signs symptoms older persons
syncope congestive failure rather acute chest pain may harbingers myocardial infarction
hand older person may present nonspecific signs symptoms confusion weakness falls weight loss withdrawal
nevertheless screening questions section may also help clarify puzzling set presenting signs symptoms older persons
asking elderly person describe general state health provides quick reliable gross assessment general health status older person
patient description perceived health problems treatment regimens provides assessment patient understanding chronic illness may provide early clues disruptions memory affect
particularly important asking patient list medications purposes
physician ascertain whether patient understands need drugs patient compliance instructions whether medications used prescribed
often set questions reveal patient may taking medications multiple sources unknown may producing signs symptoms adverse drug drug interactions
inquiry abnormalities vision hearing teeth balance gait recent life changes frequently overlooked elderly yet may carry important functional significance
presbyopia visual handicaps occur approximately patients
presbyopia easily correctable lenses subsequent major impact level patient functional independence
presbycusis another common problem older person frequently amenable hearing aid treatment
presence may predispose patient depression paranoia
asking patient look telephone number telephone directory dial number telephone physician may able check patient capabilities following complex directions using important community survival instrument
evaluation patient teeth important helping patient maintain adequate balanced nutrition well pleasing cosmetic appearance
unless patient grossly infected gums mouth patient may candidate dentures
according hogue people fall fall
falls indicative poor visuoperceptual coordination andor presence obstacles slippery rugs poor lighting stairs unnecessary furniture patient living environment
less frequently may harbingers seizure disorders cardiac arrhythmias
finally inquiry recent life changes may provide valuable clues health patient
changes involve loss multiple losses often predispose physical illness well depression
change need negative order produce stress
inquiry mental health status elderly patient important view high incidence dementia depression among elderly
examination provides suggestion functional cognitive impairment wise physician verify accuracy aspects medical history relatives friends patient
asking patient describe typical day frequently learn important information patient interests social activities eating habits
however important delve aspects cognitive functions formal manner
among early signs dementia older individuals gradual loss memory progression impairment judgment calculation ability reasoning
later course disease disorientation become major phenomenon
like younger patient changes mood blunted affect typical depression
variety mental status examinations developed use elderly
fromaje mental status examination developed libow rapidly administered easily remembered mental status evaluation general physician quantify mental status patient
noted need assistance activities daily living excellent marker patient level independence interdependence may provide clues underlying disorders
patient difficulties getting around community question patient ability function independently
deficits real perceived point need depth evaluation andor close look patient support network
patients experience difficulties dressing undressing may difficulties degenerative joint disease neurologic dysfunctions dementia parkinsonism mixed neuromuscular disorders
patients experience difficulties fixing meals may dexterity problems significant marker patient ability functional independence
also may suggest judgment deficits
patients difficulty getting bathroom bed unassisted important screen incontinence remediable mobility problems appropriate equipment provided
patients difficulties handling finances significant risk surviving independently community
need screened potential dementia need additional support persons lives
evaluating social support system patient important construct genogram outlines family constellation identifies important support people family related diseases family influences chronic illness disease
important ascertain patient considers important confidante support person
absence important confidante may important marker mental illness
inadequate support network increased likelihood need institutionalization patient otherwise physiologically frail
patient future outlook provides index general satisfaction life
strong desire ending life may tip depression
patient shows difficulty anticipating future problems worries may clue patient ability abstract realistically
impairment minimal may indicate need anticipatory guidance
separate questioning family patient friends andor caregivers provides additional useful information
family members provide long term care elderly individuals united states
frequently sources validation patient information may guide physician areas concern identified ways
ultimate goal care elderly individuals providing health care maintains maximum functional capability
requires helping patient family use personal community resources optimally cope problems encounter
normal physiologic changes aging well toll various diseases ultimately reduce functional reserve older persons compromising responses environmental stresses
nevertheless thorough knowledge age related physiologic psychologic changes coupled attempts detect remedy amenable problems early stage maximize opportunities older citizens maintain functional independence
geriatric review systems provides tool attaining goal
