measurement serum calcium fraught possible errors
several means contamination might lead false elevations serum calcium concentration
falsely low levels less common several measurements obtained lowest usually accurate
precision smac analysis automated colorimetric technique usually equal superior manual analysis
nevertheless falsely high low values may obtained patients liver renal failure patients lipemic hemolyzed specimens
venous occlusion arm venipuncture may increase total concentration serum calcium
mmoll
results increase plasma protein concentration caused hemodynamic changes
another source error posture
patient stands supine position may increase
mmoll serum calcium
still another possible source error hemolysis
methods measuring calcium affected high levels hemoglobin red cells may take calcium prolonged contact
error suspected measurement redone blood drawn following overnight fast daily intake calcium may contribute serum calcium concentration much
mmoll
still variations level serum calcium need mentioned
exercise venipuncture tends increase serum calcium patient rested least minutes prior sampling
men tend higher serum calcium
mmoll summer versus winter
postmenopausal women however higher levels calcium winter compared summer
men years age tend serum calcium levels
mmoll higher similarly aged women
values generally fall sexes year period trend reverses women age reach serum calcium levels tend fall
although calcium body technically ionized term usually applies free ionic fraction physiologically active blood table
portion total calcium forms ion couplets anions bicarbonate andor citrate known complexed calcium
together ionized complexed calcium constitute diffusible fraction calcium
portion may also called ultrafilterable calcium since passes biologic membranes
unlike protein bound calcium diffusible
protein bound calcium linked albumin remaining bound variety globulins
binding sites albumin molecule utilized normal conditions
therefore excess calcium blood occurs three calcium fractions e ionized complexed protein bound increases ratio resulting constant proportion ultrafilterable calcium
ability protein bind calcium acts buffer alters effect acute load calcium concentration ionized calcium
still another consequence large number unfilled binding sites calcium competition magnesium significant effect ionized calcium concentration
vital parameter affecting protein binding calcium ph
alkalemic ph leads increase binding hence decrease fraction ionized calcium
reason twofold competition h ca binding sites alteration configuration albumin molecule
plasma level complexed calcium usually estimated difference ionized ultrafilterable calcium
alluded complexed calcium consists ionic couplets anions hco hpo organic ions lactate citrate
abundant form seems cahco
consequence still another mechanism whereby ph alters ionized calcium concentration
rise ph leads increase hco forms complexed cahco therefore fall ionized calcium
departure
gdl normal albumin concentration account alteration protein bound calcium fraction hence total calcium level

calcium homeostatic system depends several important factors parathyroid hormone pth vitamin phosphate magnesium
pth serves receptor arm correct alterations steady state level serum calcium
small fall ionized calcium quickly lead rise pth secretion
result increase pth rapid release calcium bone
release requires active form vitamin dihydroxycholecalciferol dhcc dependent bone turnover increase number osteoclasts
effect pth probably mediated via transport calcium bone extracellular fluid ecf
requirement calcium sufficient arid prolonged pth affect osteoclast proliferation increase bone turnover
pth also acts maintain steady state level serum calcium action kidney
increases tubular reabsorption calcium magnesium decreases tubular reabsorption phosphate sodium bicarbonate potassium amino acids
pth activates adenylate cyclase system binding receptor sites renal cortex
thus leads increase cyclic adenoside monophosphate
vitamin increases concentration serum calcium several mechanisms
mentioned potentiates effect pth bone
vitamin also increases intestinal absorption calcium well bone resorption tubular reabsorption calcium
effects intestinal reabsorption calcium bone resorption seem due primarily active metabolite dhcc metabolites may contribute effects serum calcium
serum phosphorus level also plays role maintenance steady state concentration serum calcium
exact solubility product calcium phosphorus rise serum phosphate usually leads fall serum calcium
decrement may caused enhanced formation cahpo complexes serum
fall level serum phosphate conversely lead increase serum ionized bone ecf calcium
mechanisms contribute drop calcium include hypercalciuria hypoparathyroidism induced phosphate depletion
alterations serum magnesium within normal range
meql appear affect concentration serum calcium
hypermagnesemia tends suppress pth secretion may lead mild hypocalcemia
conversely moderate decrement serum magnesium may stimulate pth secretion
fall serum magnesium concentration
meql pth secretion suppressed resistance action pth target organs develops
importance normal serum calcium concentration best appreciated review clinical manifestations hypocalcemia table
hypercalcemia table
former often leads tetany convulsive seizures cardiovascular psychiatric variety ectodermal effects
hypercalcemia usually associated soft tissue calcification tubulointerstitial nephropathy anorexia nausea electrocardiographic disturbances spectrum neurologic changes headache coma
increased neural excitability fairly common manifestation hypocalcemia
patient usually describes tingling tips fingers around mouth
unabated symptoms progress severity extend limbs face
patient may also describe numbness areas may accompanied pain carpal spasm
patients positive chvostek andor trousseau sign
hypocalcemia may increase central well peripheral neural excitability two types convulsive seizures may result
first patient may suffer seizure disorder similar patient without hypocalcemia petit mal jacksonian grand mal
second systemic tetany may progress prolonged tonic spasms also referred cerebral tetany
common cardiovascular manifestations hypocalcemia involve disturbances electrical rhythm
fall serum calcium delay ventricular repolarization thus increase q interval st segment
may progress produce heart block
chronic hypocalcemia may also lead less adequate cardiac performance associated reduction blood pressure
variety psychiatric manifestations may accompany hypocalcemia
include psychoneurosis psychosis organic brain syndrome
following parathyroid surgery development hypocalcemia hypomagnesemia acute psychosis may develop characterized hallucinations paranoia
reversible correction electrolyte disturbances
several defects ectoderm often seen patients chronic hypocalcemia
cataracts common feature
results alteration local sodium pump eventual lens degeneration development dystrophic calcifications
defects development enamel teeth may occur hypocalcemia precedes maturation respective tooth
hair nails may also affected chronic hypocalcemia
may become dry brittle growth may even stunted
still unusual effects hypocalcemia may rarely occur
include disturbances blood coagulation intestinal malabsorption defective bone mineralization associated vitamin deficiency secondary hyperparathyroidism neonate hypocalcemic mother slight papilledema calcification basal ganglion
manifestations hence clinical significance hypercalcemia consist five effects soft tissue calcification tubulointerstitial renal disease anorexia nausea q prolongation electrocardiogram acute brain syndrome
three sites soft tissue calcification occur hypercalcemia even absence serum phosphate elevations
corneal andor conjunctival calcification chondrocalcinosis renal calcification
corneal calcifications usually asymptomatic conjunctival calcifications often quite irritating
