medical history patient cardiac problem usually centered symptoms due myocardial ischemia dysrhythmias reduction ventricular function
majority individuals consult physician chest pain dyspnea palpitations ankle edema syncope
symptoms may also extra cardiac causes
symptoms heart disease may absent rest appear stress medical history unique diagnostic importance
patient daily activities assessed role precipitating symptoms identifying symptoms cardiac origin
purely symptom based classification heart disease major limitations however since functional abnormalities often extensive represented symptoms alone
addition anatomic physiologic disturbances may develop advanced stages symptoms appear
examples manner principal symptoms heart disease may serve guide diagnosis highlighted
chest pain discomfort chapter numerous cardiac causes e g myocardial ischemia pericarditis pulmonary embolism aortic dissection well noncardiac etiologies e g anxiety cholecystitis pneumonia
pain myocardial ischemia characterized squeezing strangling burning sensation must differentiated pleuritic pain sharp stabbing intensified inspiration relieved sitting
among causes myocardial ischemia angina pectoris myocardial infarction
pleuritic pain usually accompanies pericarditis pulmonary embolism
dyspnea shortness breath chapter cardiac origin must distinguished dyspnea due pulmonary disease
cardiac dyspnea including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea breathlessness night orthopnea dyspnea precipitated assuming recumbent position characteristically related effort advanced stages heart disease may become present rest
rapid progression episode respiratory distress may result severe form dyspnea acute pulmonary edema e asthmatic wheezes pink frothy sputum
palpitations chapter describe awareness heartbeat
although underlying disturbance usually requires electrocardiographic confirmation occasionally cadence palpitations may ascertained bedside
palpitations may often consequence
syncope cardiac origin chapter may due either inability heart maintain adequate cardiac output given level activity dysrhythmia results sudden loss cardiac output
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction e g aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy commonly causes effort syncope whereas syncopal episodes due dysrhythmias occur either rest activity
