vomiting emesis forceful retrograde expulsion gastric contents body
nausea unpleasant sensation precedes vomiting
nausea frequently relieved vomiting may accompanied increased parasympathetic nervous system activity including diaphoresis salivation bradycardia pallor decreased respiratory rate
retching dry heaves simultaneous contraction abdominal muscles muscles inspiration may occur vomiting
vomiting differentiated regurgitation nonforceful expulsion gastric contents esophagus eructation belching expulsion swallowed gastric air
regurgitation eructation may volitional result incompetent lower esophageal sphincter
anatomic alterations esophagus mucosal rings carcinoma diverticula disorders esophageal motility achalasia diffuse spasm may simulate vomiting food bolus never reaches stomach
nausea vomiting nonspecific symptoms occur wide variety metabolic toxic inflammatory structural disorders table
determination cause requires careful assessment symptoms associated episode particular duration relation meals precipitating factors contents vomitus
abrupt onset nausea vomiting usually due toxic infectious central nervous system disorder
acute symptoms lasting several hours days found inflammatory structural lesions
chronic symptoms particularly intermittent frequently produced obstructive inflammatory process within gastrointestinal tract
chronic vomiting without systemic symptoms may self induced chronic nausea absence vomiting may clue psychogenic problems
vomiting contains recognizable food occurs several hours meals associated gastric motility disorders anatomic obstruction gastric pylorus
vomiting produced structural lesion motility disorders small bowel colon may consistent relation intake
projectile vomiting particularly arising sleep may due increased intracranial pressure
early morning nausea vomiting associated pregnancy
adverse reactions medications among commonest causes nausea vomiting symptoms may acute chronic constant intermittent
nausea vomiting learned elicited previously neutral stimuli sight hospital physician office
vomitus contains blood coffee ground like material usually indicates bleeding source proximal ligament treitz swallowed blood oropharyngeal pulmonary lesions may simulate upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding
patient develops vomiting surgery peptic ulcer disease bile stained vomitus may clue gastric inflammation produced reflux alkaline duodenal contents stomach
obstructive lesions small bowel may associated vomitus containing recognizable food clear intestinal secretions depending location obstruction time last food taken
feculent vomitus suggests gastrocolic fistula fistula colon duodenum
motility disorders producing stasis bacterial overgrowth may also associated feculent vomitus
resting tone gastric fundus establishes pressure gradient promotes emptying liquids duodenum
following ingestion solids pressure esophagogastric gastroduodenal junctions increases antral pump macerates gastric contents mean particle size less mm diameter
postprandially coordinated action antrum pylorus allows small aliquots gastric contents emptied duodenum
fasting state migrating motor complex produces regular episodes increased peristalsis sweeps undigested solids small bowel propels distally
nausea vomiting interrupt intrinsic motor activity gastrointestinal tract
nausea normal tone fundus body stomach lost pyloric sphincter pressure decreases
alkaline duodenal contents reflux freely distal stomach may produce vomiting due local irritation
retching increases intra abdominal pressure promotes duodenogastric gastroesophageal reflux simultaneous contraction muscles inspiration abdominal wall muscles diaphragm
vomiting usually occurs end inspiration intra abdominal pressure highest
diaphragm abruptly relaxes abdominal pressure suddenly transmitted chest
cardia stomach herniates diaphragm thorax stomach contents projected via esophagus pharynx
aboral peristalsis demonstrated humans required explain vomiting process
physiologic basis nausea unknown may represent conscious awareness increased activity centers controlling vomiting reflex
vomiting center vc located dorsolateral medulla adjacent ascending reticular activating system medullary centers controlling cardiovascular respiratory reflexes
afferent connections cortex limbic system hypothalamus vestibular centers gut viscera known
vc integrates input central peripheral afferents modulates autonomic somatic motor response noxious stimuli
chemoreceptor trigger zone ctz located floor fourth ventricle provides specific receptors circulating toxins blood cerebrospinal fluid relays information vc
ablation ctz abolishes vomiting produced increased intracranial pressure elevated serum levels digitalis diminish emetic response staphylococcal enterotoxin gastric distention
contrast ablation vc destroys emetic response vestibular stimulation exogenous endogenous toxins drugs mucosal irritation distention gut
cells area postrema ctz show increased concentrations catecholamiiies
antiemetic medications probably decrease output ctz antiadrenergic antidopaminergic effects
hypothesis could explain antidopaminergic medications phenothiazines butyrophenones metoclopramide reduce toxin induced nausea vomiting less useful treatment nausea vomiting produced obstruction mucosal irritation
motion induced nausea may decreased anticholinergic medications scopalomine antihistamines diphenhydramine mechanism unknown
vomiting produces dehydration metabolic alkalosis hypokalemia
one two liters stomach secretions containing meq hydrogen sodium ion per liter isoelectric quantity chloride ion produced day
distention increases volume gastric secretion
vomiting episodes bicarbonate ion generated gastric acid production remains vascular space initiates metabolic alkalosis
vomiting decreases intravascular volume increases reabsorption sodium water proximal renal tubule
since intravascular concentration bicarbonate increased relative chloride high concentrations bicarbonate delivered kidney
bicarbonate reabsorbed major anion accompanying sodium throughout renal tubule alkalosis maintained
increased tubular concentrations bicarbonate increased reabsorption sodium distal tubule promote potassium loss urine
maintenance alkalosis hypokalemia depends gastric chloride loss vomitus
volume replacement isotonic sodium chloride potassium repletion potassium chloride resolve metabolic derangements produced vomiting
treatment histamine receptor blocking agents cimetidine ranitidine may decrease secretion stomach acid lessen fluid requirements patients
vomiting particularly protracted forceful vomiting associated tears proximal stomach mucosa mallory weiss tear rarely rupture esophagus left pleural space boerhaave syndrome
herniation cardia diaphragm vomiting may responsible lesions
aspiration stomach contents particularly patients depressed central nervous system function may produce acid burns lungs mendelsohn syndrome pneumonia due aspiration oropharyngeal contents
