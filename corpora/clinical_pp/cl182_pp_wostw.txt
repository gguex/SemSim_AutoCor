nocturia awakening sleep night pass urine often early subtle clue important systemic disease
usually due loss ability elaborate concentrated urine low solute content nighttime hours
ask patient arises sleep urinate pass water many times much e drops cupfuls
determine whether patient drinks glass water whether thirst habit
patient ordinarily drink tea coffee beverages evening
previously elicited history stones recurrent urinary tract infections pelvic surgery may sought point
urine volume flow rate determined solute load osmolality medullary interstitium response vasopressin
normal circumstance sodium potassium chloride excretion high day low night
plasma vasopressin levels higher night day
thus excrete solute load especially electrolytes waking hours elaborate concentrated acid urine low solute content overnight
loss diurnal variation solute excretion ability raise urine osmolality plasma result increased nocturnal urine flow without obvious increase daytime urine volume
even isosthenuria normal daily solute load mosm excreted ml urine
contrast absence vasopressin effect result persistent hyposthenuria water diuresis cause daytime polyuria well nocturia
similarly substantial increase solute excretion cause daytime polyuria nocturia table
clinical conditions associated loss normal diurnal variation solute excretion loss renal concentrating ability result nocturia without polyuria
patients congestive heart failure decreased renal plasma flow increased filtration fraction ambulation
associated sodium retention
nighttime recumbency improves renal hemodynamics sodium excretion resulting nocturia
may early manifestation heart failure occurring preedematous stage
similar improvement renal hemodynamics recumbency accounts nocturia accompanies cirrhosis ascites nephrotic syndrome
nocturia chronic renal disease traditionally attributed early loss concentrating ability accompanies renal disease regardless etiology
careful analysis excretory patterns patients chronic renal disease reveals principal cause nocturia increased nocturnal solute excretion
similar nocturnal saluresis renal transplant recipients accounts nocturia may persist year transplantation
recent finding healthy elderly population nocturia twice night
due loss normal diurnal variation solute excretion
administration beta adrenergic blocking drugs reverses normal day night pattern sodium excretion
effect pronounced people incipient overt heart failure lesser effect normal individuals well
may result nocturia
diuretics long duration action chlorthalidone potent short acting diuretics furosemide taken shortly bedtime effect nocturnal sodium diuresis
loss maximal urinary concentrating ability occurs early forms renal diseases especially affecting medullary structures preferentially
loss concentrating ability contributes nocturia chronic renal disease
urea important constituent normal hypertonic medullary interstitium
malnourished patient may insufficient intramedullary urea effectively concentrate urine nocturia results
loss urinary concentrating ability alone cause urine volumes excess mlday
however either absence vasopressin effect persistent hyposthenuria water diuresis increased solute load solute diuresis results urine flows excess mlday
patients daytime frequency well nocturia
central pituitary diabetes insipidus causes partial complete absence vasopressin
may congenital may caused wide variety surgical traumatic inflammatory vascular conditions
administration vasopressin restores ability concentrate urine prompt reduction urine flow
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus lack renal response circulating administered vasopressin also occurs wide variety circumstances
hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus transmitted sex linked recessive trait
difficult recognize infancy repeated episodes hypernatremia may lead mental retardation
later years development megaureter bladder may partially mask polyuria nocturia
hypercalcemia hypokalemia cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
forms renal disease affect medullary concentrating structures may associated vasopressin resistant hyposthenuria
medullary cystic disease analgesic nephropathy obstructive nephropathy sickle cell disease sj√∂gren syndrome pyelonephritis examples
lastly certain medications e g lithium amphotericin b demethylchlortetracycline methoxyflurane interfere renal action vasopressin cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
rare compulsive water drinker makes persistently dilute urine complains polyuria nocturia
solute diuresis may caused increased endogenous exogenous solute loads
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus hyperglycemia glycosuria classic endogenous solute diuresis
increased urea excretion polyuria occurs hypercatabolic states
total parenteral nutrition hypertonic glucose essential nonessential amino acids may cause polyuria nocturia glycosuria increased urea excretion
agents may produce significant solute diuresis include saline mannitol radiocontrast media
increased solute excretion vasopressin resistant hyposthenuria combined solute water diuresis occur recovery phase severe renal injury
results large quantities retained urea sodium well refractoriness vasopressin
type polyuria nocturia characterizes early period following relief bilateral urinary obstruction recovery phase acute tubular necrosis often early postrenal transplantation period
