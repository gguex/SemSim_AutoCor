dysphagia means difficulty swallowing
diagnosis critical related symptoms associated act swallowing liquid solid bolus
unassociated swallowing sensation fullness upper esophagus suggests globus hystericus distinct dysphagia
globus hystericus often sign functional disorder may also represent abnormality pharyngeal upper esophageal musculature
unlike many symptoms chest pain gastrointestinal bleeding may associated esophageal disease dysphagia specifically ascribes problem esophagus
causes dysphagia basically fall two groups obstructive lesions motor disorders
specific classification categorizes cause dysphagia according location preesophageal oropharyngeal dysphagia esophageal transport dysphagia postesophageal esophagogastric dysphagia paraesophageal extrinsic dysphagia
although useful classification overlap categories
careful history critical importance evaluation patient dysphagia approximately esophageal disorders diagnosed history alone
examiner ask patient describe symptoms words
one attuned key terms food sticking chest pain painful swallowing odynophagia pointing area chest pain occurs food sticks
multiple symptoms increase likelihood organic disorder esophagus present
make diagnosis dysphagia symptoms must associated swallowing
patient asked specific questions relating dysphagia table
generally proceed follows difficulty swallowing
solids liquids
difficulty swallowing greater solids obstruction either intrinsic extrinsic esophagus difficulty greater liquids equal motor disorder
localize dysphagia
usually patient point location retrosternal area
localization helpful although may deceiving
dysphagia upper esophagus localizes upper esophagus dysphagia lower esophagus may referred level retrosternal area
long swallowing difficulty present
new chronic recurrent intervening periods normal swallowing
chronic progressive
chronic progressive dysphagia suggests neoplasm stricture
intermittent dysphagia suggests motility disturbance schatski ring typical cause obstructive intermittent dysphagia
dysphagia recurrent episodic long periods dysphagia versus normal swallowing last
trend toward worsening improvement improvement resolving reflux esophagitis spontaneous intermittent resolution motor disorders
heartburn associated dysphagia preceded associated dysphagia past reflux esophagitis
pain swallowing odynophagia
odynophagia esophageal motility disorders may aggravated temperature extremes particularly cold liquids
heartburn odynophagia esophageal motor abnormalities may occur absence dysphagia
swallowing difficulty occur first swallow initiation swallowing suggestive central neuromuscular pharyngeal disease
dysphagia classified four categories based location swallowing impairment oropharyngeal esophageal esophagogastric paraesophageal figure
four types occur four separate continuous anatomic areas
table
lists causes types dysphagia associated symptoms given table
oropharyngeal dysphagia occurs difficulty moving food bolus oral cavity cervical esophagus
normal oropharyngeal swallowing requires coordinated voluntary transfer food mouth pharynx followed rapid transfer bolus upper esophagus
symptoms relate difficulty initiation initial transport solid liquid food bolus
may include sensation occurrence food sticking oral cavity neck region well symptoms pulmonary aspiration
various neuromuscular disorders associated type dysphagia accounting causes
anatomic anomalies oropharynx also cause anomalies
common cause relates dysfunction upper esophageal sphincter
dysfunction may occur failure upper esophageal sphincter relax lack relaxation coordinated pharyngeal contraction
esophageal dysphagia occurs difficulty passage solid liquid material esophagus specifically region upper lower esophageal sphincter
results either abnormal motility segment esophagus physical impairment passage obstruction
mechanisms mediating normal esophageal peristalsis fully understood require smoothly coordinated muscular contraction one segment muscular relaxation adjacent segments
symptoms relating disordered food transport depend etiology esophageal disturbance
motility disturbances dysphagia liquids well solids
narrowing esophageal lumen compression esophagus occurs
motility disorders characterized abnormalities number contractions velocity contractions force contraction coordinated timing contractions several parameters
result symptoms addition dysphagia may include spasm lack coordinated contractions chest pain extremely forceful high pressure contractions
physical obstruction causes dysphagia swallowing difficulty solids always greater occurs earlier liquids
symptomatic dysphagia solids generally occurs esophageal lumen narrowed less mm
dysphagia liquids may occur dysphagia solids arises may occur later esophageal lumen narrowed half
esophagogastric dysphagia occurs impairment passage material lower esophageal sphincter gastric fundus due motor physical obstruction
causes include abnormalities lower esophageal sphincter benign malignant strictures distal esophagus mass lesions gastric cardia
hypertension lower esophageal sphincter typified achalasia leads dysphagia inadequate relaxation sphincteric musculature adjoining distal esophagus stomach
creates sensation food sticking lower end sternum
symptoms motility disorders may include odynophagia well chest pain resulting forceful nonpropulsive esophageal contractions
mass lesions gastric cardia create impairment normal flow food stomach
paraesophageal dysphagia occurs either physical impingement esophageal wall lumen infiltration esophageal wall leading obstruction
extensive may secondary motor effects esophagus
pain oropharynx localized neck region esophageal pain spread along six dermatomal distribution esophageal pain may present anywhere chest
dermatomes provide sensory innervation thoracic surface neck xiphoid process well anteromedial surface upper extremities
thoracic viscera also provide sensory innervation dermatomes sources sensory innervation include esophagus myocardium pericardium mediastinal structures
similarly dermatomes receive innervation lower thoracic wall diaphragmatic surface stomach duodenum pancreas gall bladder
irritation visceral structures present poorly localized pain along dermatome distribution
dysphagia one reliable symptoms elicited medical history
presence localizes patient symptoms esophagus
classification dysphagia related location includes oropharyngeal esophageal esophagogastric paraesophageal
dysphagia except paraesophageal dysphagia caused either motor disturbance physical narrowing esophagus
paraesophageal dysphagia due extrinsic compression infiltration esophagus results narrowing lumen
oropharyngeal dysphagia results neuromuscular disease greater three quarters cases
upper esophageal sphincter commonly involved
dysphagia commonly episodic although may unrelenting
aspiration frequent pain may occur
specific diagnoses include cerebrovascular accident parkinson disease multiple sclerosis central nervous system bulbar poliomyelitis diabetic neuropathy mononeuritis multiplex peripheral nervous system myasthenia gravis motor end plate dermatomyositis poliomyositis thyroid disease skeletal muscle
structural lesions oropharyngeal region commonly include neoplasia congenital webs zenker diverticulum
produce symptoms similar caused motor disturbances unlike motor abnormalities cause symptoms often unremitting progressive
clinical significance esophageal esophagogastric disorders include motility abnormalities obstructive lesions combination two
two best known esophageal motility disorders diffuse esophageal spasm achalasia
diffuse esophageal spasm characterized high pressure repetitive simultaneous rather peristaltic contractions smooth muscle portion esophagus resulting pain spasm well dysphagia
regurgitation may occur un coordinated swallowing
principal symptom achalasia dysphagia
lower esophageal sphincter hypertensive fails relax completely swallowing
compound problem peristaltic activity absent
degree dysphagia occurring achalasia variable occasional patients recognizing symptoms retrospect
chest pain accompanies typical findings achalasia syndrome vigorous achalasia hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter high pressure esophageal contractions often present
dysphagia due motor abnormalities also occur diabetes mellitus scleroderma
entities weak absent esophageal contractions ineffective peristalsis
obstructive lesions esophagus often produce progressive unremitting dysphagia
characteristic esophageal mass neoplasms also true benign malignant strictures esophagus neoplasms gastric cardia
pain may associated swallowing
sudden episodic dysphagia associated lower esophageal mucosal ring known schatski ring
schatski ring often becomes symptomatic swallowing bolus meat also known steak house syndrome
hiatal hernia often found association schatski ring
inflammatory lesions esophagus also cause dysphagia
common reflux esophagitis
inflammation associated ulceration may severe sensation obstruction may result although often obstruction due peptic stricture
infectious causes caustic substances either acid alkali cause acute inflammation dysphagia progression stricture formation
thus dysphagia caused inflammation stricture may due disordered motility segment well physical narrowing
paraesophageal lesions mimic obstructive symptoms dysphagia
causes include thyromegaly mediastinal neoplasia left atrial enlargement anomalous aorta prior surgery radiation
cases dysphagia sign esophageal dysfunction becomes sign primary disease another organ
