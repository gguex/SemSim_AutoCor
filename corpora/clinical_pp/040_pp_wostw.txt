environmental inhalation deals abnormalities pulmonary systemic result inhalational exposures dusts gases chemicals allergens infectious agents home work general environment
medicine history accompanied high index suspicion key implicating environmental exposure pathophysiologic process
detailed history environmental exposure take hours clinicians must exercise judgment regarding detail
must however least ask patient list jobs held whether job setting involves exposure dusts fumes gases like
clinician explain cause patient problem obtains history environmental exposure serendipitously finds unexpected abnormality lab test screening chest x ray must pursue detailed history
involves asking patient iterate every job ever held full part time along description tasks products manufactured substances used production
identifying potentially pathogenic substance physician extraordinarily explicit
accepting history coal dust exposure miner instance inadequate anthracite coal mining associated fibrogenic pneumoconiosis whereas soft coal mining associated simple coal worker pneumoconiosis
accepting history exposure chemicals worker chemical industry also insufficient many specific chemical substances e g toluene diisocyanate causes asthma susceptible workers well defined pathogens
workers necessarily legally entitled know generic names workplace substances substances often referred slang terms coded numbers clinician must creative defining generic ingredient trade name products
appendix end chapter lists reference sources useful pursuing inhalational exposure
history nature inhalational exposure established clinician must delineate intensity duration exposure
since individual estimate degree length time exposure toxic substance notoriously inaccurate physician must insist specific information may supplied patient company andor union
use protective measures prevent inhalational exposure important general estimate ventilation exhaust status plant patient works
materials used workers plant work site may also important
timing symptoms relation work may provide clue occupational inhalational exposure
symptom wheezing relieved weekends vacations may point toward occupational etiology
instance patients byssinosis classically wheezing resumes monday morning diminishes week goes
symptoms accompanying change job occupation make clinician think pathogenic respirable agent patient new workplace
whether fellow workers afflicted symptoms similar patient also interest
home environment important source inhalational exposure
presence pets use potentially pulmonary toxic substances e g ammonia solvents used cleaning use potential pathogen e g formaldehyde pursuit hobby like photography presence air conditioning units obvious interest
subtle exposures dusts spouse work clothes exposures documented significance substances asbestos beryllium
neighborhood patient lives may important
instance one study people living near plant produced castor oil higher incidence asthma expected
pulmonary abnormalities modify significance exposure pathogenic substance also important
example history lung disease nonsmoking relatives may indicate alpha antitrypsin deficiency presence emphysema
history hay fever asthma eczema family may indicate increased susceptibility bronchospasm even presence asthma
history chronic cough sputum production smoker suggest bronchitis
diseases may cause abnormalities deposition clearance inhaled substances
smoking active passive affects many inhalational exposures possibly working combination inhaled substances produce disease
synergistic effects asbestos exposure smoking produce mesothelioma example
socioeconomic factors extreme crowding substantially increase risk communicable diseases tuberculosis considered good inhalational history
table
summarizes requisites thorough inhalational history
variety range pulmonary systemic abnormalities environmental exposure cause vast
knowing pathogenic mechanism environmental inhalation assist clinician keeping high index suspicion possible environmental exposure illnesses whose etiologies obscure
lungs react pathogen variety ways bronchospasm proliferation reticulin andor collagen fibers edema inflammatory reaction neoplastic formation
asthma defined reversible airway obstruction common manifestation inhalation exposure may occur soon exposure e within minutes delayed hours
basis bronchospasm immunologic pharmacologic simply irritative
pneumoconioses fibrogenic nonfibrogenic
people nonfibrogenic pneumoconioses present abnormal chest x ray due proliferation reticulin respiratory symptoms referable inhalational exposure abnormalities pulmonary function testing increase morbidity mortality compared control populations
example benign pneumoconiosis stannosis consequence working tin
contrast workers fibrogenic pneumoconioses example asbestos workers asbestosis protracted course characterized increasing dyspnea possibly cough
allergic alveolitis characterized cough fever dyspnea hours exposure antigen
examples include farmer lung office workers exposure thermophilic actinomyces air conditioning system
granulomatous lung disease may manifestation pathogens different beryllium tuberculosis
frank pulmonary edema andor chemical pneumonitis often consequences exposure irritant gases ammonia nitrous oxide
lung cancer long term consequence exposure agents asbestos chromates bischloromethyl ether
systemic complications environmental inhalation common
high concentration carbon monoxide environment instance cause exacerbation preexisting coronary artery disease andor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exposure mercury vapor cause renal neural toxicity solvents carbon tetrachloride affect practically organ system body
examples neoplastic pathology consequences environmental inhalation include bladder cancer alanine workers liver cancer polyvinyl chloride workers
number new substances used industry proliferates challenge identify pathogenic substances increases
many new materials substituted known pathogenic substances possibility new substances may pathogenic requires vigilance
continued epidemiological monitoring crucial identify possible new pathogens individual clinician also serve important role surveillance
instance experts estimate people asthma bronchospasm basis occupational exposure data indicate continued exposure may lead chronic irreversible airway obstruction
challenge individual clinician identify asthmatic obvious
even clinician unable help individual incurred irreversible process mesothelioma realize identifying pathological process may impetus investigation subsequent elimination hazard workers
conceivable disease environmental inhalation grossly underestimated
