five cardinal symptoms musculoskeletal disease table pain swelling erythema redness warmth stiffness
pain major symptom
aching throbbing words often used patients describe musculoskeletal pain contrast crushing boring sharp reference ischemic visceral neuropathic pain
pain also characterized location positional relationships frequency duration precipitating relieving factors
historical identification swelling erythema warmth great importance
stiffness symptom unique musculoskeletal system
predilection stiffness certain times day e g upon awakening duration location points considerable historical importance
pattern involvement ascertained anatomic area self limited progressive migratory stationary effect treatment modalities
presence degree weakness neurologic deficits ascertained
physical examination composed particular sequence order used every patient thereby ensuring completeness
useful sequence general inspection posture gait symmetry upper extremities including temporomandibular chest wall joints spine pelvis lower extremities table
goniometer measure joint angles tape measure required instruments table
general inspection begins observing patient standing position postural abnormalities
observe erect stance abnormal curvature kyphosis lordosis scoliosis
patient walk toward away
patient sits examining table facing examiner
joint assessed tenderness swelling erythema deformity asymmetry chapter
range motion pain movement effusion crepitus stability noted
temporomandibular joint chapter examined first beginning proximally working distally figure
palpation done mouth closed open
shoulder joints figures
contiguous joints examined
observe palpate assess range motion joints glenohumeral acromioclavicular sternoclavicular costochondral
also examine gliding tissue space scapula thorax shoulder capsule rotator cuff subacromial bursa
range motion checked follows
forward flexion normal parallel floor
arms head pressed ears normal degrees
shoulder adduction normal degrees
external rotation touch back neck
internal rotation touch back pocket opposite side
proximal musculature evaluated strength patient abducting shoulders parallel floor resisting examiner downward pressure
examiner moves shoulders elbows
examine depth grooves obliteration sign synovial disease
look subcutaneous nodules distal elbow joint
evaluate range motion extension zero degrees flexion degrees
test radiohumeral joint patient fully pronate fully supinate hands
wrists next figures
observe palpate
ask patient press palms together elevate forearms parallel floor
note skin temperature move wrist hands figure unless joint inflammation temperature decrease
individually observe palpate assess range motion major joints metacarpophalangeal proximal interphalangeal distal interphalangeal
record grip strength bilaterally figure
patient remains seated examination cervical spine
observe lordosis kyphosis
palpate tenderness
check flexion patient place chin chest figure check extension patient look ceiling far back possible figure
lateral motion ear shoulder figure
rotation chin shoulder figure
patient stands evaluation spine
record normal curvatures
palpate spinous processes paravertebral muscles
check range motion
flexion keep knees straight touching floor
lateral maintain feet together bending first one side
rotary turn shoulder far side possible
patient lies examination lower extremities
hip examined first
palpation value greater trochanter area bony prominence lateral aspect hip region
tenderness suggests trochanteric bursitis
following maneuvers carried hip
abduction fix pelvis placing hand side tested
abduct leg maximally figure
flexion pelvis fixed
flex hip knee bent normal degrees knee straight normal degrees
external rotation ask patient place fifth small toe table normal degrees
internal rotation normal degrees figure
flexion contracture opposite knee flexed lumbar lordosis flattened figure
hip extended fully flush examining table contracture
straight leg raising knee fully extended leg raised flexed hip produces stretch sciatic nerve
positive test pain hip low back radiation sciatic distribution suggestive nerve root irritation
angle elevation leg table point pain produced recorded figure
hyperextension patient assumes prone position asked lift leg table far possible without raising pelvis
knee examination next
inspection carried discoloration swelling deformities particularly lateral angulation genu varum medial angulation genu valgum
note increased skin temperature swelling determine swelling due synovial proliferation thickening opposed actual effusion
following maneuvers carried knee
flexion note degree flexion least degrees
extension note deficit ability fully extend degrees
ligamentous laxity stretch medial ligament placing palm hand lateral side knee pulling leg toward lateral side ankle figures
correspondingly stretch lateral side place palm medial knee place hand lateral ankle pull toward examiner
note obvious laxity
cruciates test stability anterior posterior cruciates holding femur fixed position knee flexed degrees attempting pull push tibia forward backward femur
correspondingly forward movement indicates defect anterior cruciate ligament whereas backward mobility indicates defect posterior cruciate ligament
ankles examined next
observe discoloration swelling palpate increased tenderness
dorsiflexion patient asked pull toes toward knee figure
plantar flexion ask patient push feet far go figure
lastly feet inspected abnormal coloration localized areas swelling
look obvious abnormalities longitudinal arch including falling arch called pes planus flat foot abnormal elevation arch called pes cavus
first metatarsophalangeal joints observed lateral angulation called hallux valgus
toes examined hammer toe cock deformities metatarsal heads observed plantar surface formation callosities pressure points
palpate phalangeal metacarpophalangeal joint figure
flexion toes actively passively flexed maximum observing decreased mobility evidence crepitus
extension aforementioned small joints toes checked ability extend fully
eversion inversion eversion inversion primarily function subtalar tarsal joints checking complete peripheral joint examination figure
