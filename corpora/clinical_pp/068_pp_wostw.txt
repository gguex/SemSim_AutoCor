muscle atrophy decrease muscle volume bulk
conversely muscle hypertrophy increase muscle size
pseudohypertrophy increase muscle size due infiltration fibrous fatty tissues usually associated decrease strength
muscle tone refers tension present relaxed muscle resistance passive movement
may decreased hypotonia increased hypertonia
within latter group rigidity state steady heightened muscular tension equally present opposing muscle groups
spasticity velocity dependent increase tension muscle passively lengthened
fasciculations spontaneous visible muscle twitches due contraction muscle fibers motor unit
fibrillations contractions individual muscle fibers visible skin
myokymia condition characterized continuous slow undulating contractions muscle due repetitive discharge motor nerves
myotonia sustained uncontrollable contraction associated delay muscle relaxation
examination motor system traditionally included assessment muscle bulk tone power identification spontaneous activity
tools required accomplish little one powers observation palpation judgment
order various aspects examination covered individualized tailored clinical situation one convenient method begin process inspection
need wait patient enter examining room much learned observing patient arises seat walks room gets examining table
examining room patient disrobe preserving course necessary modesty
although may seem obvious unusual telltale signs cloaked clothes
patient scrutinized evidence wasting weakness abnormal movements
looking focal wasting compare bulk muscle neighbor counterpart opposite side
keep mind patient general build slender individuals may seem diffusely wasted
since asymmetric development uncommon using minor differences measured circumference limbs determine atrophy notoriously unreliable
conjunction wasting muscle weakness may impart certain appearances
facial muscle weakness may signaled ironing forehead wrinkles andor flattening nasolabial fold sagging lower eyelid hollowing temples inability close eye fully
sometimes mild weakness becomes evident patient smiles angle mouth instead turning remains horizontal depressed producing snarl
involvement eyelid elevators results drooping lid ptosis
compensatory raising eyebrows may maintain weak lid normal level revealed increased number forehead creases abnormal side
muscles act brace scapula thorax weaken several characteristic changes occur
hands normal standing held thumbs facing forward tend turn inward causing back hand face front
early one might detect hump midportion trapezius muscle works aid scapular fixation
viewed back lower medial border scapula may protrude wing
since finding always readily apparent afflicted patients yet mimicked comparable profile normal thin individuals helpful patient lift arms front body lower slowly
maneuver cause scapular edge pop accentuating true winging
shoulder girdle strength deteriorates scapula actually slides laterally upward folding clavicle
associated pectoral muscle wasting axillary fold normally runs straight becomes slanted diagonally inward
limbs similarly surveyed loss muscle bulk abnormal posture
wasted muscles flattened scalloped contour tensed develop normal bulge
weakness thenar muscles hand thumb instead held right angles fingers comes lie plane producing simian hand
intrinsic hand muscles affected hand assumes clawlike deformity fingers extended metacarpophalangeal joints flexed interphalangeal joints
muscular weakness lower extremity often betrayed alterations gait described
one going visual inspection alert spontaneous muscle activity fasciculations myokymia
fasciculations may difficult see obese patients infants
said best appreciated oblique lighting sometimes lightly tapping muscle activate
searching fasciculations tongue may significant diagnostically prone misinterpretation
protruded tongue might appear quivering due contraction small intrinsic muscles
therefore one patient partly open mouth view tongue rests quietly floor mouth
myokymia unlike brief twitch fasciculation slower prolonged nature muscle surface seems undulate
direct palpation percussion times useful adjunct appraising muscle
degeneration atrophy muscle loses normal texture becomes soft flabby
enlarged muscles due true hypertrophy firm resilient whereas pseudohypertrophy occurs forms muscular dystrophy muscle takes rubbery woody consistency
patients complain muscle tenderness nodules palpation help ascertain findings arise muscle overlying tissues
percussion muscle usually limited role examination yet also may produce diagnostic responses
one response myotonia
phenomenon readily demonstrated thenar eminence sharp tap percussion hammer causes adduction thumb persists several seconds relaxation occurs
cooling extremity may necessary bring myotonia
muscles deltoid tongue percussed involved show depression slowly disappears
functionally myotonia uncovered simply shaking hands noting patient inability release quickly
remember normal muscle also react struck contraction brief relaxes immediately
furthermore myotonia mistaken myoedema reaction seen hypothyroidism metabolic disturbances
percussion causes dimpling muscle radiates outward followed development small mound point impact remains seconds
clues muscle tone gleaned inspection palpation assessment hinges judging resistance muscle passive movements
implicit criterion patient relaxed
nevertheless demanding patient relax often produces unexpectedly opposite result
instead making testing inobtrusive part exam sufficient degree relaxation usually attained
patient may need gently instructed go loose floppy make limb like spaghetti
tone tested moving part full range motion initially slowly varying speeds
upper extremities commonly checked flexing extending elbow rotating hand wrist grasping wrist shaking hands grasping hands shaking arms
lower limbs one pump knee patient supine examiner hand patient knee quickly lift knee table noting heel slides table normal actually rises hypertonia
hypotonic limb feels limp hyperextensible one shaking wet noodle
spasticity increasing tension develops rapid movement may suddenly melt away clasp knife effect
since opposing muscles involved differing degrees resistance usually greater one direction
moreover spasticity velocity dependent phenomenon resistance slow speeds even
rigidity another state increased tone differs spasticity opposing muscles affected equally providing constant pull entire range motion speed
certain extrapyramidal disorders e g parkinson disease one may also detect superimposed rachety sensation passive motion termed cogwheeling
often type rigidity easily perceived wrist intensified repetitive movements opposite side e g tapping hand knee opening closing fist
commonly confusing clinical finding seen patients diffuse cerebral dysfunction gegenhalten paratonia
patient seems actively oppose passive motion despite examiner exhortations relax
suspicions weakness arise sections examination resolved evaluation muscle strength
fundamental aspect motor testing worth mastering allows one determine degree distribution weakness present
muscle power judged either manual testing individual muscles patient perform maneuvers stress certain muscle groups
two methods mutually exclusive used complementary fashion
individual muscles tested instructing patient either resist efforts examiner move fixed part initiate movement examiner resistance
latter technique may best studying weak muscles former generally simpler patient understand cooperate enables physician better isolate muscle tested
actuality isolating action single muscle extremely difficult since functionally alike muscles contribute every movement
nevertheless proper positioning prevailing activity muscle usually discerned
example hip extension knee extended involves participation gluteus maximus hamstrings knee flexed gluteus maximus acts extend hip
moreover attention positioning important preventing employment accessory muscle substitute weakened one e g biceps weakness patient may partially pronate forearm utilize brachioradialis
contrast normal muscle may appear weak placed mechanical disadvantage e g presence wrist drop finger flexors may seem weak unless wrist extended
pitfall partially avoided fixating proximal side joint distal parts tested
finally good examine weak muscles altitude effects gravity eliminated
hand hand system examination must means recording communicating results
muscle power graded various ways perhaps widely accepted medical research council classification rates strength scale follows movement trace contraction active movement gravity eliminated active movement gravity active movement gravity resistance normal strength
routine testing every muscle clearly practical
probably reasonable screen would examine strength major joint principal movements focusing investigation clinically indicated
reader referred dejong mayo clinic medical research council several excellent texts descriptions individual muscle evaluation
although manual testing essential trying determine exact distribution impairment disadvantage somewhat time consuming insensitive mild grades weakness particularly powerful muscles lower extremities
functional testing admittedly looks groups muscles often better uncovering slight paresis monitoring progression disease
example mild upper limb weakness may disclosed patient hold arms extended front palms eyes closed minute
strength reduced arm pronate begin drift
pelvic girdle musculature assessed asking patient carry several tasks including arising chair getting squatting position
hip weakness may hesitation movement patients may need use arms momentum boost
another test pelvic girdle strength one especially applicable children arising sitting position floor
classically weak patients turn side pull knees body rest hands knees
straighten knees lift buttocks air remaining flexed hips
finally straighten hips occasionally placing hand thigh extra push
known gower maneuver
distal weakness legs may manifest difficulty walking one heels ankle dorsiflexors involved walking hopping toes ankle plantar flexors weak
indeed manner one walks attests functioning multiple levels neuraxis
mentioned clinician get habit watching patient walk around examining room
look whole personthat legs also posture stooped
lordotic arm swing free reduced
symmetric associated movements e g chorea dystonia
note length speed individual steps
observe patient assumes broad base keeps eyes glued ground
listen gaitfor flopping sound foot drop scraping sound hemiparetic gait stamping sound ataxic gait
inspect worn places patient shoes
formal testing ask patient turn quickly command counting number steps required turn walk tightrope one foot directly front good way detect ataxia andor walk heels toes
one must aware factors contractures involuntary movements changes tone proprioceptive deficits pain psychiatric disorders interfere patient performance despite normal strength
certainly care taken interpreting apparent weakness pain present
unlike diminished constant resistance offered paretic individual patient pain often displays poorly sustained efforts abruptly give way
similar finding noted patients hysterical motor weakness
hysterical weakness may suspected feeling contraction antagonist muscles testing agonist
patient may observed normally activity requires action allegedly enfeebled muscle e g easily stepping onto examining table yet unable lift thigh request
even effortless movement involves highly complex incompletely understood integration multiple neural circuits
follows merely simplified schematic review motor system
evidence suggest idea perform movement originates motor association areas frontal lobe
subsequent planning initiation action though require input basal ganglia cerebellum
structures receive information frontal association areas funnel output motor cortex via thalamus
moreover constantly kept abreast ongoing motor activity ascending sensory pathways either direct indirect also collaterals corticospinal tract fibers
networks allow basal ganglia particularly cerebellum coordinate muscle activity movements smooth accurate
surprisingly cerebellum basal ganglia damaged movements become clumsy spatial temporal patterning muscle contraction disrupted involuntary movements appear
motor cortex thought responsible sending final commands execute movement
message passes downstream via several descending pathways perhaps best known corticospinal pyramidal tract
constituent fibers system arise approximately equal numbers motor cortex area adjacent frontal area sensory areas parietal lobe
fibers descend nonstop posterior limb internal capsule basis pedunculi medullary pyramids majority decussating caudal portion medulla form lateral corticospinal tract cord
destined end directly either motor neurons interneurons sensory neurons
ignored however extrapyramidal descending pathways
indeed experimental lesions pyramidal tract medullary pyramids causes hypotonia derangement fine distal movements
tracts also contain cortical fibers make connections subcortical way stations basal ganglia cerebellum brainstem nuclei
except cerebellum components inhibitory total effect injured usually result spasticity rigidity
actuality naturally occurring lesions tend affect combination descending fibers clinical features result generally said reflect upper motor neuron damage
final common pathway central nervous system cns controls skeletal muscle action motor neurons spinal cord cranial motor nuclei
motor neuron innervates group muscle fibers fibers constitutes motor unit
discharge motor neuron results contraction muscle fibers
whether lower motor neurons fire contingent summation descending local reflex information impinge
one basic circuit participates local reflex activity contributes significantly muscle tone gamma loop
skeletal muscle contains specialized receptors called spindles signal spinal cord muscle stretched
within spindle small muscle fiber innervated gamma small diameter motor fiber sets spindle tension
higher tension sensitive spindle stretch vice versa
thus gamma system bias reactivity spindle regulate local afferent influence motor neuron
moreover gamma system modulated descending impulses tonic phasic nature
many disorders cns motor function e g spasticity rigidity understood terms imbalance system
finally voluntary movement guided continuous sensory feedback spinal cord higher centers
since sensory motor systems inextricably tied together impairment former may disturb many aspects normal movement
realizing components motor system work unit would oversimplification strictly attribute certain signs specific anatomic systems
nevertheless characteristic changes muscle tone strength gait provide direction toward location nature pathologic process see table
features upper motor neuron corticospinal system dysfunction occur lesions motor cortex descending pathways corona radiata internal capsule brainstem spinal cord
motor findings contralateral neural damage decussation pyramids ipsilateral
depending site extent lesion weakness vary anywhere slight pronator drift clumsiness skilled distal movements complete plegia
entire extremities discrete movements rather particular muscles involved relative sparing flexors internal rotators upper extremities extensors external rotators lower extremities
muscles tend eventually though inevitably develop increase tone often spasticity
atrophy prominent early although wasting may occur time owing disuse
gait however frequently altered due increased tone extensor predominance leg
hemiparesis arm tends held tightly side flexed stiff without normal swing
leg thrown outward hip circumducted
toe shoe dragged may noticeably worn outer aspect
legs involved gait may become scissor like knee crossing front every step
disease lower motor neuron engenders entirely different clinical constellation
weakness may restricted distribution certain spinal segment peripheral nerve diffuse polyneuropathy tends maximal effect distal limb muscles
muscle atrophy often pronounced sometimes associated hypotonia
motor neuron root irritation spontaneous muscle fasciculations may seen
foot drop due weakness ankle dorsiflexors present gait may take steppage quality
order avoid dragging toe patient compensates lifting leg high toe hitting ground first
may resemble gait seen profound sensory loss patient stamps foot gain sensory input instance though entire sole tends strike
primary muscle disease may find expression several patterns weakness none correspond either specific spinal segment nerve
commonly involvement symmetric proximal although selective forms occur e g facioscapulohumeral syndromes
may tenderness wasting even pseudohypertrophy
tone absence contractures normal decreased
patients pelvic girdle weakness gait may assume waddling nature inability fix pelvis
patient walks marked lordosis throwing hips side side shift weight body
injury cerebellum basal ganglia measurably reducing muscle power definitely impair motor function
cerebellar signs result disease cerebellum inflow outflow tracks brainstem ipsilateral lesion
hypotonia ill defined muscle fatigability may occur principal manifestations cerebellar dysfunction disturbances coordination gait
particularly midline cerebellar lesions gait becomes broad based unsteady staggering lurching
patient unable tandem walk may persistently sway one side damage extends cerebellar hemisphere
ataxic gait cerebellar disease confused bizarre ambulatory exhibitions psychogenic origin
hysterical gaits recognizable inconsistency varying moment moment often requiring coordination normal
basal ganglia disorders also profoundly interfere normal ease movements
certain conditions present parkinsonian manner characterized increase tone rigidity cogwheeling paucity slowness initiating movements reduction loss many normal associated movementsall absence decreased muscle power atrophy
gait reflects deficits
patient walks stooped posture hips knees slightly flexed little arm swing
although beginning steps may quite slow tendency pace quicken patient shuffles forward festination
patient may turn en bloc several small steps sudden changes direction done easily
contrasting picture seen chorea
patient may decrease tone marked hyperextensibility joints
gait may wide based lurching often remarkable excessive abnormal movements posturing
