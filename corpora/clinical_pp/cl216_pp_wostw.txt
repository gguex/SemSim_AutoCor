glass thermometer probably instrument used frequently
cooperative patients oral glass thermometer recommended convenience patient acceptance
oral temperature measured probe placed tongue lips closed around instrument
patient recently smoked ingested cold hot food drink
oxygen delivered nasal cannula affect accuracy measurement
three minutes time commonly quoted accurate temperature measurement wise wait least minutes
reading abnormal thermometer replaced minute intervals reading stabilizes
rectal thermometers indicated children patients cooperate fully
continuous frequent temperature measurements made rectal probe thermocouple connected recording device repeated glass thermometer measurements axilla groin folds
rectal temperature measured lubricated blunt tipped glass thermometer inserted cm anal canal angle ° horizontal patient lying prone
three minutes dwell time required
electric digital thermometers convenient glass instruments probe cover disposable response time quicker allowing accurate measurements within seconds signal rate change temperature becomes insignificant

cellular oxidative metabolism produces constant stable source heat
mechanical muscular contraction results bursts heat needed
heat produced conserved vasoconstriction diversion blood flow away skin
dissipation heat depends vasomotor changes regulate blood flow skin mucous membranes sweating
heat lost skin surfaces mechanisms convection radiation evaporation
dissipation convection efficient ambient wind current increased evaporation primary mechanism high ambient temperatures unless atmosphere saturated water vapor
heat dissipated breathing panting
heat loss either conduction gastrointestinal gi tract via ingestion cold food drink immersion cold water normally important mechanism

exercise heavy work may responsible production heat raises core temperature °c °f temperature usually returns normal within minutes cessation exertion
insulation exposure ambient temperatures greater °c °f especially conditions water vapor pressure dehydration interfere normal mechanisms heat dissipation
fever pyrexia result thermoregulatory mechanisms response elevated set point
set point raised acted endogenous pyrogen substance liberated leukocytes interact exogenous pyrogens microorganisms nonmicrobial antigens certain steroid hormones
endogenous pyrogen protein daltons produced neutrophils eosinophils monocytes kupffer cells alveolar macrophages exposed exogenous pyrogens
endogenous pyrogen closely related identical lymphokines interleukin leukocyte activating factor leukocyte endogenous mediator
endogenous pyrogen liberated bloodstream interacts preoptic regions anterior hypothalamus raises thermoregulatory set point variable degree usually greater °c °f
endogenous pyrogen placed directly cerebral ventricles high fevers induced concentrations fold less
hyperpyrexial states greater °c may produced direct mechanism
endogenous pyrogen causes increased firing hypothalamic thermosensitive neurons resulting augmentation heat conservation production mechanisms resultant fever
moderate increases set point satisfied heat seeking behavior peripheral vasoconstriction increased metabolic rate
marked increases set point mechanisms heat production conservation augmented mechanical conversion chemical energy heat muscular shivering rigors
chilliness felt patient whose fever rising probably caused central perception demand raise central core temperature cold receptors skin due peripheral vasoconstriction
molecular mechanisms mediate interaction endogenous pyrogen hypothalamus effector mechanisms resulting fever completely understood
prostaglandins e series thought play role excitation thermosensitive neurons hypothalamus
monoamines present high concentrations thermosensitive site
cyclic nucleotides also implicated intermediates induced released endogenous pyrogen
even febrile states normal diurnal fluctuations temperature maintained although sometimes extreme mechanisms
