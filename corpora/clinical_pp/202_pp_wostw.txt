depression subjective experience patient feels sad unhappy often hopeless
depressed patient experiences little pleasure
suicidal thoughts often present
since depression almost universal experience patients able respond directly questions
although patients may understand term depression almost everyone understand feeling blue feeling sad
times patients depression may aware associated physical symptoms fact depressed
physician alert investigating physical symptoms often associated depressive syndrome
include anorexia weight loss menstrual irregularity difficulty concentration insomnia easy fatigability
complaints may include change activity level may either agitation decreased activity
many depressed patients also strong feelings guilt
symptoms present physician always inquire presence depression
inquiry life circumstances usually elicit conditions concern depressed patient
times inquiry reveal occult depression e depression patient recognize
example depressed female patient might mention husband staying late night deny concerned
although denying concern husband anger toward present unconscious basis may highly significant cause depression
detecting occult depression particularly useful patient describe activities bring pleasure
one major characteristics depression loss zest living vague feeling nothing worth effort anymore
whenever depression exists interviewer inquire concerning suicidal thoughts
times inexperienced interviewers concerned asking whether person thought suicide
concern little basis
patient deeply depressed possibility suicide certainly considered
general agreement among workers field suicidology asking patient suicidal thoughts carries little risk precipitating suicide attempt
omission inquiry suicidal thoughts far dangerous since could result failure part physician take preventive action could save patient life
biochemical changes occur brain depressed patients great complexity subject wide investigation
metabolism dopamine norepinephrine serotonin affected tricyclic antidepressants monoamine oxidase inhibitors
point definitive evidence regarding monoamines critical importance development depression seems likely extent involved
norepinephrine hypothesis depression postulates depression occurs actual relative decrease amount norepinephrine central nerve cell synapses
serotonin hypothesis indicates similar deficiency serotonin primary cause depression
much yet learned biochemical factors depression
clear however although work somewhat different cellular mechanisms monoamine oxidase inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants facilitate action norepinephrine dopamine serotonin central synapses
efficacy classes antidepressants relieving depression seems strongly linked action upon norepinephrine dopamine serotonin
however evidence neurotransmitters may also involved development depression
subject suicide carefully studied major cities suicide prevention center
suicide major cause death suicides recorded annually united states
number suicide attempts probably eight ten times number
since majority persons commit suicide visited physician within months deaths physicians probably opportunities prevent suicide professional group
unfortunately physicians fail diagnose serious depression may unwittingly furnish patient means suicide
murphy found half patients series overdose deaths studied received recent prescriptions lethal amount hypnotic medication
since one fourth suicides overdosing medication apparent physicians need alert evidence suicidal potential patients
even slightest doubt possibility exists physician prescribe small amounts
many physicians use rule thumb practice giving five eight times hypnotic dose one time roughly one week supply
suicides potentially preventable
characteristically person commits suicide feels ambivalent done
act often carried impulsively delayed may take place
behooves every physician make strong efforts prevent suicide even point involuntary hospitalization
depression treatable illness
successfully treated variety measures including cognitive therapy psychodynamic psychotherapy behavioral therapy antidepressant drugs electroshock therapy
also potentially fatal condition
may part many physical illnesses
mentioned earlier certain physical findings characteristically associated depression
include loss appetite loss weight kg lb weight loss occurs without cause month period depression probably quite severe difficulty sleeping disturbances menstruation
patient inability sleep often characterized awakening early morning hours unable return sleep
depressed patients also tend take longer fall asleep longer sleep latency
menstrual disturbances usually direction sparse irregular absent menses
physician often required make judgment concerning suicidal potential
many factors considered making judgment including
expression intent method chosen impulsivity family history suicide age sex living circumstances physical illness religion occupation level depression psychosis previous history attempted suicide
general wise axiom physician always take seriously expression suicidal intention
patient mentions plans commit suicide able describe meticulous fashion ways carrying likelihood suicide much higher patient vague ideas ending
attempts suicide method produce significant physical disfigurement chosen usually considered serious efforts disfigurement potential
thus attempts hanging use gun jumping building generally viewed serious efforts produce little disfigurement slashing wrists
seriousness suicide attempts drug overdose often judged amount medication taken manner carried
person takes relatively small dose medication circumstances early discovery likely reason suspect attempt aimed obtaining psychologic support actually causing death
potential suicide higher patients impulsive
many people carry act hope prevented actually causing death
mood person considering suicide may change suicidal nonsuicidal short period time even hours
factors equal suicide less likely patient make considerable effort order obtain drug gun sleeping medication materials suicide effort
consequently removal easy access methods suicide protective effect
many statistical studies demonstrate history suicide close relative patient significantly increases risk suicide
thus suicidal thoughts patient whose mother committed suicide would regarded serious potential factors would case family history suicide
suicide infrequent children age
occur children age maybe sense accidental since child may fully understand finality suicidal act
adolescents adults suicide significant cause death
suicide third leading cause death among adolescent males
although women attempt suicide frequently men men actually commit suicide three times often women
adults sexes incidence suicide greater among older age groups peaking men age women
suicide considered likely occur depressed person experienced change living circumstances predispose toward life loneliness
general people living solitary circumstances serious risks suicide people companions
twenty percent suicides occur patients chronic physical illness
thus presence chronic physical illness heightens risk suicide
patients belong religious groups roman catholic church strong teaching suicide somewhat lower rate suicide general population
occupations combine high stress easy accessibility materials suicide tend show higher rate suicide
example physicians higher suicide rate general population
patients severe depression likely commit suicide patients mild depression
however noted time particular danger depression may occur patient first showing improvement
patients depressed unable pull together sufficiently commit suicide
begin improve become able organize sufficiently commit suicide
may go phase sufficiently organized carry act still depressed enough wish even though depression showing improvement
consequently patients must carefully watched early stages improvement severe depression
psychotic patients generally considered increased risk suicide
usually relates poor reality contact
cases patients may hallucinations instructing kill
physicians sometimes falsely reassured fact patient attempted suicide unsuccessfully several times
unless clear efforts suicide minor represented efforts gain attention physician concerned rather less concerned patient previous suicide attempts
high percentage patients commit suicide attempted suicide unsuccessfully least
obviously patients positive items
clinician must aware presence factors make judgment likelihood suicide basis overall picture
general larger number factors present single patient higher risk suicide
surprisingly significant numbers physicians note presence depressive symptoms fail institute treatment clear explanation depression patient life situation
fawcett aptly stated presence reason depression constitute good reason ignoring presence
