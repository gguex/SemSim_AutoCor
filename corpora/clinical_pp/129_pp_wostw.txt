use gloved left index finger gently firmly palpate patient right lateral tongue border looking masses irregularities sore points
common site squamous cell carcinoma
early diagnosis crucial lesions metastasized time diagnosis
many investigators feel high incidence carcinoma area attributed trauma tongue brushes past mandibular molars deglutition speech
reverse hand roles without changing either patient position inspect left surface tongue
inspect sublingual space patient place tongue roof mouth open wide
relative protection food sublingual space highly keratinized epithelium
also likely site intraoral carcinoma due abundant lymphatic drainage cancer space likely metastasized
focus attention middle fold ventral surface tongue lingual frenum
ordinarily frenum attaches one third way back tip tongue
occasionally children attachment almost tip tongue result child tongue tied
inability child place tongue roof mouth posterior maxillary incisors form sound results early speech defects
base lingual frenum salivary caruncle includes openings submaxillary ducts drain submaxillary glands sublingual ducts drain sublingual glands
near posterior limits sublingual space near lingual border mandible may seen salivary eminences mark superior surfaces sublingual glands remaining portion gland nestled lingual fossa shallow depression mandible
oral carcinoma detected sublingual space common site junction tongue floor mouth
normal tooth appears white without obvious signs decay
gums gingiva pink red without signs recession tooth bleeding
obvious dental decay usually detected inspected
often patient identify specific tooth one side
fact frequently patient isolate upper arch versus lower arch source pain
absence radiographs simple percussion valuable guide
percuss suspected tooth two three adjacent teeth comparison
almost always offender identified easily patient

use finger pressure test mobility teeth
switch tongue blade right hand examine patient gingiva teeth left manner
last patient close mouth normal bite bare teeth
using tongue blade retract either cheek visualize patient occlusion
obvious occlusal deformities noted
many occlusal deformities corrected oral surgery orthodontic treatment
discussion teeth occlusion must include reference muscles mastication temporomandibular joint
three systems may viewed separately pure anatomic considerations represent finely balanced dynamic relationship patient
clinician observed case acute gonococcal arthritis temporomandibular joint fractured mandible painful abcess molar tooth attest fact
integral part occlusion ability masticate properly bilateral symmetry muscles mastication
main group muscles consists masseters temporalis internal external pterygoids
attachment mandible maxilla enable patient open close mouth
examine muscles mastication next
face patient directly
note bilateral asymmetry beginning midcheek area extending angle mandible posteriorly temporal area superiorly
asymmetry exists masseters external pterygoids may palpated bimanually
patient hold jaw slack
place right gloved forefinger intraorally opposing left finger
palpate muscles fashion looking lumps masses
third component occlusion temporomandibular joint
teeth occlusion muscles mastication contraction head condyle posterior superior position glenoid fossa shaped like flattened
temporomandibular joint complicated joint ginglymoarthrodial type
three main movements along glenoid fossa downward forward rotational mandible opens moves side side
examine temporomandibular joint face patient
turn little fingers toward gently insert patient external auditory meatus
patient open close several times
able feel heads condyles move forward begin opening movement glenoid fossae
position front patient ear

listen carefully signs grating crepitus patient opens closes
condyle head may also palpated externally point
peculiarities oral cavity unique
body cavity shares close relationship external environment represents many varied functional anatomical entities contains bacterial flora amount variety encountered normal human mouth
mechanical irritation smoking eating drinking alters normal appearance oral cavity one patient another many instances patient week week
warm moist contents mouth harbor enormous bacterial populations immediately superimpose lesions whether mechanical pathological frequendy distort diagnostic picture giving lesions appearance bacterial nature
lesions mouth form crusts due dissolving effect saliva wet line lip lesions different physical appearances dry line lip lesions
many abnormalities oral cavity purely dental origin scope many
sir william osler first refer mouth mirror body
early signs many common degenerative diseases nutritional deficiencies disease metabolism seen intraorally physically apparent elsewhere
enamel dentin fixed records past history individual
alveolar bone gingiva tongue indicators present systemic state individual
diet plus mineral constituents saliva lead formation dental plaque consists part bacteria scattering leukocytes macrophages epithelial cells contained within amorphous ground substance matrix
plaque soft first may brushed away soft toothbrush
days formation soft plaque precipitation calcium salts begin harden plaque becomes hard dental calculus
current dental research indicates plaque sugar streptococci must three present sufficient quantities dental caries initiated
except masticating swallowing jaws usually rest position approximately mm apart
closing condyle goes posterior position glenoid fossa closing muscles contact teeth contact
complicated maneuver involving numerous neuromuscular reflexes teeth occlude conscious effort
however begins chewing motion
chew one side time
dentists refer working side involving actual grinding
time opposite side dental arch involved balancing lower buccal cusps glide balance lingual cusps upper molars
occurs different opening closing muscles brought play condyle head goes different motions
taken quite literally many components interacting produce chewing motions take granted disruption components lead problems
instance new filling
mm high interfere chewing extent make eating impossible
edentulous patients different case entirely
dentures must closely mimic natural dentition terms jaw distances closing
temporomandibular joint dysfunction result
oral manifestations systemic diseases malocclusion local aspects dental problems e g caries periodontitis viewed proper context
normal healthy dentition functioning healthy oral cavity critical patient nutritional well
anything interferes mastication beginning digestive process makes function patient systems difficult
early recognition fact often critical factor rectifying future problems
often falls physician many patients never visit dentist seek dental care specific dental problem
oral carcinoma primary site represents total occurrence carcinoma
due abundant drainage oral cavity early metastasis via lymphatic venous systems common
lungs breasts common areas secondary involvement
approximately deaths year accorded oral cancer
year cure rate less cases one lowest form cancer
however number victims surviving years doubled treatment initiated lesion less cm diameter
inability open close mouth maximally indicate acute process chronic one
examples acute process include focal abscess involving muscles mastication fractured zygoma hinders movement coronoid process mandible
chronic inability open mouth freely due ankylosis temporomandibular joint result formerly broken unmanaged condyle head caused long standing arthritis
deviation mandible either right left reveal type acute chronic processes
local invasion basal squamous cell carcinoma tuberculosis involving temporomandibular joint cause muscles mastication present clinical picture
lip common site oral carcinoma squamous cell restricted lower lip cases occurring often men women ratio
commonly result overexposure sunlight actinic radiation
fortunately tends metastasize may treated wide local excision irradiation
basal cell carcinoma commonly occurs maxillary lip
buccal mucosa common site leukoplakia defined clinically white patch rub moniliasis instance rub
precancerous lesion biopsied removed
cancer buccal mucosa appears frequently middle third cheek
vestibules common sites leukoplakia caused snuff dipping
cancer either hard soft palate usually squamous cell glandular
may begin shallow punched ulcer rolled indurated margins may papillary wide base
failure detect lesion early lead oral antral oral nasal fistulas
tongue second common site oral carcinoma posterior lesions generally malignant ones
unlike oral cancers pain early symptom
carcinoma tongue present leukoplakia ulceration papillary type may extend floor mouth
junction lateral base tongue anterior tonsillar pillar common site fissure appearing lesion easily missed examination
tongue cancers metastasized time detection
cancer sublingual space often associated leukoplakia although common site leukoplakia
general rule posterior lesion malignant
early metastases cervical lymph nodes common
plaque accumulates near gingival attachment especially mm normal gingival pocket becomes source chronic irritation
eventually leads chronic inflammation gum tissues resultant downward migration gum attachment
leads progressive loss bone since physiologically height supporting alveolar crest bone always mm gingival attachment deeper gum pockets accumulation bacteria including anaerobic strains deeper pockets mobile teeth bleeding gums
common term signs symptoms pyorrhea
may occur one area mouth throughout dentition may occur early childhood approximately years slow buildup
periodontal pain due chronic acute periodontal disease generally characterized ache pressure related ache contrast heart throbbing quality dental pulp pain classic toothache
allowed encroach dental pulp decay leads pulpal necrosis resultant death neurovascular component tooth
necrosis dental pulp usually begins apex root foramen small therefore blood supply vulnerable
time pain usually heart throbbing nature characteristic vascular component
allowed progress necrosis results abscess apex root
accumulation purulent exudate root tooth continues relieved root canal therapy tooth extraction erosion nearby bone opens fistula usually outside dental arch buccal bone thinner lingual bone
first signs abscess resultant cellulitis large swelling fistula face near apex teeth
uncommon frequently apex certain teeth attachment maxilla buccinator mentalis mylohyoid muscles easiest avenue fistula subcutaneous tissue directly face rather muscle attachments back oral cavity
occlusion key mastication
severe occlusal deformities frequently corrected combination orthodontics orthognathic surgery
muscles mastication occlusion temporomandibular joint closely related functionally pathology area often difficult pinpoint
frequent complaint involves called temporomandibular joint syndrome
patient reports pain opening closing mouth specifically chewing occurring general area external auditory meatus
current investigators attribute disruption occlusion causes muscles mastication spasm exacerbates occlusal disharmonies
cyclic phenomenon difficult break requires combination drugs physical therapy occlusal adjustments cases
certain drugs aspirin monoamine oxidase inhibitors compazine stelazine thorazine also capable causing pain closely resembles phenomenon
