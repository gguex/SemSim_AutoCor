nerve supplies sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles following functions
rotation head away side contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle
tilting head toward contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle
flexion neck sternocleidomastoid muscles
elevation shoulder trapezius
drawing head back face upward trapezius muscles
weakness paralysis functions decreased absent
lesion nuclear infranuclear associated muscle atrophy fasciculations
observe volume contour sternocleidomastoid muscles patient looks ahead
test right sternocleidomastoid muscle facing patient placing right palm laterally patient left cheek
ask patient turn head left resisting pressure exerting opposite direction
time observe palpate right sternocleidomastoid left hand
reverse procedure test left sternocleidomastoid
continue test sternocleidomastoid placing hand patient forehead pushing backward patient pushes forward
observe palpate sternocleidomastoid muscles
test trapezius
ask patient face away observe shoulder contour hollowing displacement winging scapula
observe drooping shoulder
place hands patient shoulders press patient elevates shrugs shoulders retracts shoulders
eleventh nerve two parts
smaller cranial part arises cells nucleus ambiguus ultimately distributed vagus nerve
portion innervates pharyngeal muscles
main part spinal portion arises long column nuclei situated ventral part medulla extending fifth cervical segment lower
supranuclear innervation well known
characterized authors ipsilateral contralateral bilateral
begins precentral gyri descends corticobulbar tract
fibers leave cord join together ascend foramen magnum leave jugular foramen vagus nerve
nerve descends neck near jugular vein supplies sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles joined motor sensory contributions upper cervical nerves
recent insights supranuclear contributions discussed clinical significance section
sternocleidomastoid muscles originate sternum clavicle insert mastoid process
one rotates head opposite side body away side muscle tilts head side body
acting together sternocleidomastoid muscles flex neck bring head forward
trapezius muscle originates occiput spinous processes cervical thoracic vertebrae inserts clavicle scapula
controversy centers whether part muscle supplied spinal accessory nerve many believe upper portion supplied eleventh nerve
head fixed trapezius elevates shoulders
scapula fixed draws head ipsilaterally jointly trapezii pull head back face upward
supranuclear lesions eleventh nerve cause moderate often transient impairment function sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles due bilateral innervation

recent report three cases dissociated weakness sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles provided insight neuroanatomy spinal accessory nerve manon espaillat ruff
following comments based upon cases addition previous anatomical findings
nuclei sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles appear somatotopically arranged cervical cord
motor neurons c innervate sternocleidomastoid neurons c innervate trapezius
innervational pattern account isolated weakness one muscle
supranuclear innervation motor neurons muscles appears take different courses
supranuclear fibers precentral gyrus destined sternocleidomastoid descend brainstem tegmentum fibers going trapezius motor neurons ventral brainstem
consequently restricted lesions locations produced dissociated weakness two muscles
supranuclear fibers sternocleidomastoid appear double decussation brainstem
first occurs caudal oculomotor complex pontine tegmentum second cervicomedullary junction bender shanzer wagman
therefore level single lesion produce ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid weakness contralateral trapezius weakness
findings lead following clinical generalizations reference localization manon espaillat ruff
trapezius weakness one side sternocleidomastoid weakness contralateral side indicate upper motor neuron lesion ipsilateral involved sternocleidomastoid oculomotor nerve nucleus trapezius muscle weakness sparing sternocleidomastoid points lesion ventral brainstem lower cervical cord lower spinal accessory roots sternocleidomastoid weakness alone indicates brainstem tegmentum upper cervical accessory root lesion weakness muscles ipsilaterally produced lesion contralateral brainstem ipsilateral high cervical cord accessory nerve lesion peripherally nerve bifurcates muscles peripheral lesion distal bifurcation also produces weakness involving one muscle
