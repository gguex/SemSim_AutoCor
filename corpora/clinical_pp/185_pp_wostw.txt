acute pain one testicle patients age considered surgical emergency
failure correct spermatic cord torsion testicular ischemia within hours result loss testicular function testicular atrophy
torsion spermatic cord testicular torsion commonly confused infectious epididymo orchitis torsion testicular epididymal appendices
thirty percent seminomas teratomas embryonal cell carcinomas testes also present unilateral pain tenderness testicle tumor related pain gradual onset initially less intensity seen acute torsion

occurrence associated symptoms fever discharge helpful differentiating causes acute chronic constant testicular pain enumerated tables
radionuclide scanning useful patients
rule torsion testicle produces cold scan predictive value negative predictive value positive
false positives cold scans may caused hydroceles hematomas hernias trapped bowel diagnose testicular abscess diagnose testicular rupture torsion trauma victims diagnose epididymo orchitis hot scan evaluate testicle patients normal physical examination associated emotional problems
radionuclide scans may miss lesions

summary radionuclide angiography identify cases torsion cold scan epididymo orchitis hot scan
hydrocele hematoma hernia may cause decreased isotope uptake mimic testicular torsion
testicular torsion rare age cases reported literature
epididymo orchitis uncommon age
testicular torsion torsion spermatic cord sudden onset pain swelling retraction testis occurs testicle frequently always found high scrotal sac
may recurrent attacks past
doppler scan may show absence pulsatile blood flow radionuclide scan show lack isotope uptake affected testis
failure operate within hours onset pain result testicular damage
recently immunologic mechanisms incriminated loss fertility contralateral testis following unilateral torsion partial testicular infarction ischemia
therapy requires correction torsion bilateral orchidopexy prevent recurrence
figure
shows alternative approaches management
surgeons refuse rely radionuclide scans immediately explore scrotal sac young men presenting painful tender scrotal swelling
approach may lead nearly testicular salvage unnecessary surgery operated
use scans new computer diagnostic programs may allow selectivity surgical exploration selective approach painful tender scrotal mass still controversial since salvageable testes may missed
epididymo orchitis dysuria frequency suprapubic perineal penile discomfort may precede testicular pain swelling
urine may normal show pyuria
epididymis alone testis epididymis may swollen tender
localized focal epididymal tenderness may occur
fever chills occur onset may acute insidious
causes infection sexually transmitted organisms gonococcus chlamydia trachomatis usually responsive doxycycline
coliform bacteria may also causative common men age
recurrent attacks occur
testicular abscess complicate epididymo orchitis torsion requires surgical drainage
suspected radionuclide scan prolonged course patient presenting symptoms signs epididymo orchitis
torsion testicular epididymal appendix rare age common puberty
intense pain occurs upper pole involved testis firm tender
cm nodule felt
ischemic appendix purple viewed scrotum produces blue dot sign
diagnosed disorder successfully managed nonoperative means
patients surgery required persistent pain
reactive hydrocele scrotal edema redness testicular epididymal swelling may develop make accurate diagnosis impossible without surgery
major risk missing case testicular torsion since torsion testicular appendix usually resolve spontaneously
testicular blunt trauma may cause hematoma contusion rupture testis secondary torsion infarction
acute scrotal swelling blunt trauma studied radionuclide angiography explored rupture torsion
thirty percent patients testicular tumors present testicular pain tenderness swelling
common teratomas also occurs seminomas embryonal carcinomas
radionuclide scans may hot show halo effect similar seen abscess missed torsion
surgical removal radiotherapy chemotherapy required
viral orchitis may occur mumps salivary gland involvement rubella coxsackie viral infections
orchids also occurs chickenpox echovirus infections dengue lymphocytic choriomeningitis
analgesics scrotal support required symptomatic relief testicular pain tenderness resolve weeks
small number patients develop testicular pain within months years vasectomy
patients postvasectomy pain associated tender sperm granuloma vasectomy site
others associated epididymal swelling tenderness
pains increased ejaculation relieved vasovasostomy restores fertility reduces high back pressure vas epididymis
excision painful sperm granulomas vasectomy site brings relief without restoring fertility patients painful vasectomy site granulomas
number patients explored testicular pain tenderness apparently normal appearing testes
cause pain tenderness remains undetermined cases found surgical series
ureterolithiasis may present hematuria flank lower abdominal pain testicular pain positive intravenous pyelogram
microscopic hematuria common gross hematuria
stones usually pass ureter urine since testicular pain occurs stones lower ureter
prostatitis causes urinary frequency urgency penile discomfort dysuria perineal testicular aching well lower abdominal pain
diagnosis made examination first ounce voided early morning urine massage prostate obtain prostatic fluid
latter procedure avoided acute prostatitis possibility producing bacteremia
sexual arousal orchialgia may occur heavy petting young males
relieved ejaculation
small incarcerated inguinal hernia cause inguinal testicular pain compression genital branch genitofemoral nerve
lyme arthritis follows tick bite causes infection borrelia burgdorferi spirochetal organism
fever disabling arthritis distinctive skin rash characterize disorder occurs many geographic regions united states
polyarteritis nodosa rarely may present bilateral testicular pain tenderness well testicular induration
biopsy tender indurated area may reveal diagnosis cases

testicular involvement leukemia causes bilateral enlargement sometimes pain tenderness
six leukemic patients clinical evidence testicular disease
hepatic splenic nodal involvement frequent associated findings

genitofemoral neuralgia causes intermittent constant inguinal testicular upper medial thigh pain
pain increased walking stooping extension hips decreased hip flexion bed rest
inguinal canal may tender
neuralgia results nerve entrapment following appendectomy hernia repair
neurectomy genitofemoral nerve within abdomen brings relief
bilateral involvement may occur
cases idiopathic
ilioinguinal neuralgia causes inguinal testicular low back pain

limitation internal rotation hips extension
hypesthesia may occur inguinal area
nerve blocks may relieve pain
nodular fibrositis causes low back pain relieved injection subcutaneous mobile nodule lidocaine methylprednisolone
rarely palpation nodule reproduce testicular pain
iliac artery aneurysm may associated inguinal testicular pain pulsatile unilateral lower abdominal mass
