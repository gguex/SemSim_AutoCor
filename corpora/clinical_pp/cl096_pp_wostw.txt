anatomic arrangement muscular fascial layers lower abdomen makes area site potential weakness possible development inguinal hernias
passage region vas deferens spermatic vessels male round ligament female makes area vulnerable hernia protrusions
inguinal groin hernias may congenital exiting along spermatic cord round ligament indirect hernias may occur due weakness transversalis fascia producing direct hernias
defects medial femoral vein passes beneath inguinal ligament allow development femoral hernias
approximately inguinal hernias occur males whereas femoral hernias occur females
history pain swelling presence mass groin area significant
specific questions need asked long noticed discomfort swelling mass pain
standing activity lifting intensify evoke pain
coughing sneezing make lump prominent
lying relieve symptoms allow swelling disappear
push mass back hand
ever difficulty pushing mass back abdomen

children specifically infants parents observation swelling protusion may positive feature evaluation
examination inguinal region men women best performed patient standing physician seated stool facing patient
observation groin area oblique light patient relaxed actively coughing may reveal bulge abnormal motion
scrotal masses may also noted inspection palpation
carefully observe whether bulge noted inguinal hernia femoral hernia inguinal ligament crease
examiner stand side patient fingers lightly applied groin shown figure left hand patient left side right hand patient right side
fingers placed femoral region external inguinal ring internal ring patient cough
palpable bulge impulse located one areas may indicate hernia
examiner return sitting position
male scrotum side inverted examining index finger entering inguinal canal along course cord structures
size external ring ascertained palpating lateral pubic tubercle
patient coughing hernia bulges felt either side examining finger direct hernia tip finger approaches internal ring indirect hernia
large indirect hernias may extend way scrotum giving gross appearance hydrocele
transillumination scrotal contents darkened room aid differentiating hydrocele intrascrotal indirect inguinal hernia
mass found groin examination gently pressed examining fingers attempt reduce hernia thereby cause contents sac return peritoneal cavity
incarcerated hernias may reduced easily patient recumbent examining table
mild sedation may necessary provide sufficient muscle relaxation allow reduction
hernia mass tender palpation associated symptoms nausea vomiting considered possibly strangulated compromised vascularity entrapped bowel attempt made reduce manually
condition represents acute surgical emergency
indirect inguinal hernias due persistence processus vaginalis internal ring varying distance along course spermatic cord round ligament
protrusion peritoneum constitutes called hernia sac
hernia become detectable however intra abdominal fat fluid viscus enters sac
processus vaginalis always located anterior medial structures spermatic cord round ligament
time pressure applied intra abdominal contents sac causes enlargment sac dilation internal inguinal ring
prolonged enlargment transversalis fascia primary support posterior wall inguinal canal becomes attenuated
direct inguinal hernia develops medial internal inguinal ring
posterior wall weakens transversalis fascia thins bulge results
hernias usually contain properitoneal fat bladder wall rarely found extend scrotum
femoral hernias exit retroperitoneal space along femoral vessels femoral canal occasion confused inguinal canal hernias
indirect inguinal hernias may cause discomfort pain also may lead severe problems requiring urgent emergency surgery prevent correct life threatening complications
incarcerated hernia represents entrapped viscera usually small bowel omentum easily reduced peritoneal cavity internal inguinal ring gentle pressure hernia mass
although vascularity incarcerated bowel may compromised patient develops intestinal obstruction
requires early surgical release entrapped bowel repair hernia defect
prolonged entrapment bowel hernia sac tight internal ring leads edema bowel subsequent venous occlusion arterial congestion finally gangrenous changes involved bowel wall mesentery
strangulated hernias result intestinal obstruction also bowel perforation peritonitis septicemia vascular collapse
rapid resuscitation surgical intervention resection compromised segment bowel required prevent ensuing complications may lead fatal outcome
elective surgical repair hernias found physical examination prevents problems may develop incarcerated strangulated viscera
emergency surgical correction mandatory incarcerated strangulated inguinal hernia develops
