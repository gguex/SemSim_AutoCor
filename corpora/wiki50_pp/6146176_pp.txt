hoxsey himself traced the treatment to his great grandfather who observed a horse with a tumor on its leg cure itself by grazing upon wild plants growing in the meadow 
john hoxsey gathered these herbs and mixed them with old home remedies used for cancer 
among the claims made in his book he purports his therapy aims to restore physiological normalcy to a disturbed metabolism throughout the body with emphasis on purgation to help carry away wastes from the tumors he believed his herbal mixtures caused to necrotize 
hoxsey initially opened a clinic in taylorville illinois to sell his treatment one of clinics that he would eventually open

regarding this campaign nci director john heller wrote in 
our efforts in cancer control are directed toward reduction of the intervals between onset and diagnosis of cancer and between diagnosis and the application of effective treatment 
people who fall victims to quacks are diverted from this narrow course for the best clinical management of cancer 
the american medical association condemned hoxsey s caustic pastes and tonics as fraudulent 
in hoxsey sued the journal of the american medical association jama and its editors for libel and slander 
hoxsey won the case but was awarded only the judge concluded that since hoxsey s promotion of his treatment depended largely upon claims that the ama was persecuting him he had suffered little or no damage from the jama articles 
a review of patients treated by hoxsey found no verifiable cures 
in hoxsey submitted case histories of patients to the national cancer institute nci claiming that they were fully documented with clinical records and pathological reports and that they would demonstrate his treatment s effectiveness 
however the nci found that of these reports only included actual tissue biopsies 
of the biopsies from patients described by hoxsey as having internal cancer neither showed any evidence of actual malignancy 
the nci concluded that hoxsey s records did not contain sufficient information to evaluate his treatment 
hoxsey argued that it was the nci s responsibility to seek out the information necessary to verify his case reports and attributed the failure to do so to a conspiracy on the part of the nci and ama 
in the fda sent an investigator to hoxsey s clinic posing as a patient 
the investigator was told by hoxsey s clinic that he had cancer he did not and that it would take a long time to cure him

the bio medical center in tijuana mexico claims a success rate of in their promotional material though these figures have not been independently evaluated and the parameters of treatment success are undefined

reviews by the memorial sloan kettering cancer center and m d anderson cancer center found no evidence that hoxsey therapy is effective as a treatment for cancer 
a controlled experiment in lab mice did not find any difference in tumor growth between untreated mice and those given the hoxsey tonic 
an fda review of people claiming to have been cured by the hoxsey method found that many of the patients never in fact had cancer or had received successful medical treatment elsewhere before being treated with hoxsey therapy 
those who had cancer at the time they used hoxsey therapy were uniformly either deceased or alive with active cancer 
there were no cases of actual cures among those promoted as such by the hoxsey clinic 
in a group from the university of british columbia visited hoxsey s mexican clinic and obtained records for canadian patients treated by hoxsey 
the university panel found that 
for over one half of the cancer patients from british columbia the result of treatment with the hoxsey method has been either death or progression of the disease 
in nearly one quarter there was no proof that the patient ever had cancer 
nearly one in ten of the patients had curative treatment before going to the hoxsey clinic 
in only one case an external cancer was there any evidence at all that the hoxsey treatment had an effect on the disease in that case better results could have been obtained by orthodox means 
the panel reported that in the one case of demonstrable cure a patient with a skin cancer of the ear hoxsey s treatment had resulted in disfigurement which could have been avoided with standard surgical excision 
in the office of technology assessment issued a report on herbal cancer treatments 
this group found that while many elements of hoxsey therapy had antitumor activity in vitro the complete hoxsey tonic had never been tested in animal models or in human clinical trials 
several books on herbalism have claimed that some of the herbs in the therapy have anti tumor effects in vitro 
according to botanist james a duke of the united states department of agriculture eight of the nine hoxsey tonic herbs have some anti tumor activity in animal models five have antioxidant effects and all nine have antimicrobial activity that may be linked to cancer fighting effects 
duke s assessment was that the hoxsey tonic ingredients showed very significant chemical and biological anticancer activity 
a article in the journal of naturopathic medicine followed patients treated with hoxsey therapy in tijuana 
patient interviews were used to confirm the existence and stage of cancer some of the patients were unaware of the stage of their tumor and in some cases medical records were not available 
most patients were lost to follow up of the patients successfully followed who claimed to use the formula died and were alive 
the survivors all claimed by mailed responses to questionnaires to be disease free after five years of follow up 
review of this study pointed out its obvious flaws including the majority of patients lost to follow up lack of access to detailed medical records and reliance upon patients for disease stage information the authors themselves regarded the results as unclear 
these same authors interviewed patients at other alternative cancer clinics in mexico 
not one patient at these other clinics claimed that they personally knew anyone who had attended those clinics and had been cured of cancer or anything else 
as a curious anecdote every one of the patients attending the hoxsey clinic the bio medical center claimed to personally know someone who was diagnosed with cancer in north america came to the hoxsey clinic and claimed to be cured of their cancer 
a analysis published in the alternative medicine literature explored the feasibility of using the bio medical center s records in tijuana as the basis for outcomes research on hoxsey therapy 
of patients treated for cancer at the bio medical center in the authors found that less than half of these patient records contained pathology reports verifying a cancer diagnosis 
additionally had already received conventional treatment such as surgery chemotherapy or radiation therapy with a possible curative effect 
the authors were able to verify survival status in only of the treated patients due to lack of documentation follow up and identifying information in the bio medical center charts 
of the cohort of patients were still alive years after treatment with hoxsey therapy had died and could not be located and their status could not be determined 
the authors concluded that it was not possible to reliably assess the bio medical center s outcomes because of the lack of documentation limited follow up and failure to confirm in many cases the existence or stage of cancer 
the treatment gained wide press coverage in due to a court dispute between the family of starchild abraham cherrix and social services of the state of virginia 
cherrix had requested to undergo hoxsey therapy to treat a recurrence of hodgkin disease 
because at the age of he was still a minor social services considered the parents to be negligent and sought to have cherrix undergo conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
on august circuit judge glen a tyler announced that both sides had reached an agreement that the parents did not act in a way that was medically neglectful 
in addition it stipulated that starchild would be treated by an oncologist of his choice who was both board certified in radiation therapy as well as interested in alternative methods to treat hodgkin disease 
cherrix subsequently received radiation treatments from dr arnold smith of mississippi and in september it appeared that his cancer was in remission 
however a gofundme com allegedly published by cherrix indicated r adiation four times and chemotherapy twice have both been unsuccessful even if they were initially effective 
the cancer itself has been in remission six times and he somehow managed to keep his body in decent condition by building my strength after every treatment 
the fundraising page further indicated that cancer had returned to his lung
