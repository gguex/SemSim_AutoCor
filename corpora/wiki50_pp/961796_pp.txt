professor henry jarrod vincent price is a talented wax figure sculptor with a wax museum in s new york city 
he specializes in historical figures featuring sculptures of john wilkes booth joan of arc and one of marie antoinette which he considers his masterpiece 
when his business partner matthew burke roy roberts demands more sensational exhibits to increase profits jarrod refuses 
jarrod then gives a private tour to renowned art critic sidney wallace 
wallace deeply impressed with jarrod s sculptures agrees to buy burke out but will not be able to do so until after he returns from a continental trip 
that same night burke deliberately sets the museum on fire intending to claim the insurance money 
in the process he fights off jarrod who is desperately attempting to save his precious sculptures 
burke splashes kerosene over jarrod s body and leaves him to die in the fire 
miraculously jarrod survives but with severe injuries including crippled hands 
he builds a new house of wax with help from deaf mute sculptor igor charles bronson and another assistant named leon averill 
jarrod now concedes to popular taste and includes a chamber of horrors that showcases both historical crimes and recent events such as the apparent suicide of his former business partner burke 
in reality burke was murdered by a cloaked disfigured killer who then staged the death as a suicide 
burke s fiancée cathy gray carolyn jones is murdered soon afterward 
her body mysteriously disappears from the morgue

unsatisfied sue returns after hours and uncovers the horrifying truth behind the house of wax many of the figures are wax coated corpses including cathy and burke 
sue is confronted by jarrod who proclaims her his new model for a sculpture of marie antoinette both jarrod and wallace had earlier noted sue s striking resemblance to the original sculpture 
sue tries to fight him off striking his face which is revealed to be a wax mask that shatters and exposes fire scarred flesh beneath this in turn reveals that it was jarrod who was the cloaked figure who murdered burke and stole cathy s body 
he subdues sue and straps her to a table preparing to coat her living body with wax 
the police having learned the whole truth from averill arrive in time to save her 
jarrod tries to escape but fighting with a police officer dies when he is knocked into the vat of molten wax he had prepared for sue 
like cinemascope and other wider and larger screen formats stereoscopic d was an alternative technology that hollywood turned to in the early to mid s in an attempt to compete with the proliferation of television which had halved theater attendance 
just over feature films were released in d during the formats first emergence which dawned with the premiere of bwana devil in late november 
the fad began in earnest with the first major studio d releases in the spring of showed signs of faltering in the fall seemed to be recovering in the winter then rapidly faded and died early in with a belated last gasp provided by the spring release of revenge of the creature 
except for a very few occasional independent productions such as september storm the bubble andy warhol s frankenstein and some x rated adult films there would be no new english language d feature films until the early s 
all of the s us feature length d films were originally shown by the polarized light method and viewed through gray lensed polarized glasses but in the s a few were theatrically re released as red and blue glasses anaglyph d prints which unlike the original format did not require special projection equipment and a non depolarizing screen 
beginning in the early s anaglyph versions of several s d films were broadcast on television and released in home video formats 
house of wax was never theatrically shown broadcast on television or sold for home use in anaglyph form in the us but an unauthorized anaglyph version on bootleg video or even mm film may exist 
during its original release house of wax used the two strip natural vision d format which employed separate mm film prints for the left eye and right eye images projected by two separate but interlocked projectors 
this required making substantial alterations to the theater s projectors 
in house of wax was re released in the convenient mm stereovision single strip format which squeezed both images onto one strip of film and required only an external projector attachment and a non depolarizing screen 
stereovision s deluxe mm version of their format which made possible a clearer and brighter image was used for engagements at large and prestigious venues such as grauman s chinese theater in hollywood and the seat metropolitan theatre in boston 
after the initial heavily advertised re release stereovision prints remained available for theatrical rental for several years and were occasionally shown later in the s 
a new wave of d films in the early s which resulted in many theaters being equipped with the correct type of screen increased interest in the d films of the s and prompted another re release of house of wax in 
to accompany its stereoscopic imagery house of wax was originally available with a stereophonic three track magnetic soundtrack although many theaters were not equipped to make use of it and defaulted to the standard monophonic optical soundtrack 
previously films with stereo sound were only produced to be shown in specialty cinemas such as the toldi in budapest and the telecinema in london 
apparently only the monophonic soundtrack and a separate sound effects only track have survived 
as of no copy of the original three channel stereo soundtrack is known to exist 
a new stereo soundtrack has recently been synthesized from the available source material 
the film also included an intermission which was necessary to change the film s reels because each projector of the theater s two projectors was dedicated to one of the stereoscopic images 
to celebrate the th anniversary re release of the film on d blu ray it was screened for a theatrical audience for the first time digitally by the santa fe film festival and the jean cocteau theater in santa fe new mexico on halloween 
vincent price s daughter victoria price and constantine nasr director of the documentary house of wax unlike anything you ve seen before were in attendance to talk about the making and history of the film 
this was the first time the film was shown using a modern k ultra hd d video projector sony srxr p k digital cinema projector 
as in the audience wore polarized d glasses like those used to view modern d films not the red and blue anaglyph glasses used for the re releases and videos of some other vintage films and now often mistakenly associated with the d films of the s 
house of wax filmed under the working title the wax works was warner bros answer to the surprise d hit bwana devil an independent production that premiered the previous november 
seeing something big in d s future warner bros contracted julian and milton gunzburg s natural vision d system the same one used for bwana devil and filmed a remake of their thriller mystery of the wax museum which was based on charles belden s three act play the wax works 
among the significant changes the earlier film was set in the year it was released whereas house of wax was moved back to circa the entire newspaper angle and the characters played by glenda farrell and frank mchugh were eliminated and while the masked figure was only seen sparingly in mystery making his identity a bit of a puzzle he is shown early and often in this remake leaving little doubt that it is indeed the sculptor 
among the foregrounded uses of d in the film were scenes featuring a wax museum fire can can girls and a paddleball wielding pitchman 
in what may be the film s cleverest and most startling d effect the shadowy figure of one of the characters seems to spring up out of the theater audience and lurch into the screen 
ironically director andré de toth was blind in one eye and unable to experience stereo vision or the d effects 
it s one of the great hollywood stories vincent price recalled 
when they wanted a director for a d film they hired a man who couldn t see d at all 
andré de toth was a very good director but he really was the wrong director for d he d go to the rushes and say ‘ why is everybody so excited about this it didn t mean anything to him 
but he made a good picture a good thriller 
he was largely responsible for the success of the picture 
the d tricks just happened there weren t a lot of them 
later on they threw everything at everybody indeed some modern critics agree that detoth s inability to see the depth is what makes the film superior as he was more concerned with telling a thrilling story and getting believable performances from the actors than simply tossing things at the camera 
house of wax was one of the biggest hits of earning an estimated million in rentals from north american box offices alone 
although long seen only in flat d form on television and in occasional revival theater screenings by the mid s it was usually listed among the classic horror films and even touted as the best us horror film of the s 
it revitalized the film career of vincent price who had been playing secondary character parts and occasional sympathetic leads since the late s 
after this high profile role he was always in high demand to play fiendish villains mad scientists and assorted other deranged characters in genre films such as the tingler the masque of the red death and the abominable dr phibes 
supporting player carolyn jones whose career had barely begun when she appeared in house of wax found her widest and most lasting fame eleven years later as morticia addams in the tv comedy horror spoof the addams family 
the film s influence can be seen in many horror pictures that followed the hammer films productions in particular
