lorenz beam blind landing radio navigation system developed c lorenz ag berlin 
first system installed berlin tempelhof central airport followed d체bendorf switzerland others world 
lorenz company referred simply ultrakurzwellen landefunkfeuer german ultra short wave landing radio beacon lff 
prior world war ii germans deployed landing aid system many luftwaffe airfields outside germany equipped bombers radio equipment needed use 
raf continued using system late name standard beam approach sba 
basic idea behind short range lff system later developed long range system air navigation known elektra 
development produced system worked long distances hundreds thousands kilometres known sonne often elektra sonnen allowed aircraft u boats take fixes far atlantic 
british captured sonne receivers maps started use navigation name consol 
blind approach navigation system developed starting dr ernst kramar lorenz company 
adopted deutsche lufthansa sold around world 
lorenz company founded carl lorenz part itt 
lorenz used single radio transmitter mhz anflugfunkfeuer three antennas placed line parallel end runway 
center antenna always powered two short circuited mechanical rotary switch turned simple motor 
resulted kidney shaped broadcast pattern centered one two side antennas depending antenna short circuited 
contacts switch set one antenna shorted time considered dot morse operator dash 
signal could detected distance end runway much km 
lorenz obtained sharper beam could created aerial array two lobes signal 
pilot approaching runway would tune radio broadcast frequency listen signal 
heard series dots knew runway centerline left dot sector turn right line runway 
right would hear series dashes instead dash sector turned left 
key operation system area middle two signals overlapped 
dots one signal filled dashes resulting steady tone known equi signal 
adjusting path heard equi signal pilot could align aircraft runway landing 
two small marker beacons also used one end runway hez haupteinflugzeichen another km away vez voreinflugzeichen broadcast mhz modulated hz respectively 
signals broadcast directly upward would heard briefly aircraft flew 
approach runway pilot would fly published altitude use main directional signals line runway started flying toward 
flew vez would start descending standard glide slope continuing land abort hez depending whether could see runway 
lorenz could fly plane straight line relatively high accuracy enough aircraft could find runway visually worst conditions 
however required fairly constant monitoring radio pilot would often also tasked talking local control tower 
order ease workload lorenz later introduced cockpit indicator could listen signals display direction runway centerline arrow telling pilot direction turn 
indicator also included two neon lamps indicate aircraft crossed marker beacons 
later derivatives system signals equal length pattern left right silence operate visual indicator cabin 
lorenz system similar diamond dunmore equi signal radio guidance system developed us bureau standards early 
second world war lorenz beam principle used german luftwaffe basis number blind bombing aids notably knickebein crooked leg x ger채t x apparatus bombing offensive english cities winter 
knickebein similar lff modifying slightly highly directional work much longer distance 
using frequencies allowed bombers use already installed lff receivers although second receiver needed order pinpoint single location 
x ger채t involved cross beams characteristics different frequencies would enable pilot calculate speed time crossing fore cross signal crossing main cross signal indicate drop payload 
calculation performed mechanical computer 
lorenz modified system create viktoria hawaii lateral guidance system v rocket 
british discovered existence knickebein system rapidly jammed however x ger채t successfully jammed quite time 
later innovation germans baedeker taub modification used supersonic modulation 
quickly jammed germans practically gave use beam bombing systems exception fuge operated short time towards end operation steinbock known baby blitz 
operational drawback system bombers follow fixed course beam transmitter station target beam detected defensive measures made effective knowledge course

sun derivation lorenz used luftwaffe long range navigation atlantic using transmitters occupied europe another neutral spain existence discovered british direction r v jones allowed continue use un jammed felt actually useful raf coastal command germans 
british use german system named consol remained un jammed period war 
long range version developed germans war used many countries civilian purposes war mostly english name consol 
transmitters installed us uk ussr 
reason lorenz beam principle necessary overlapping beams sharpness beam increases approximately logarithmically length aerial array generated 
law diminishing returns operates attain sharpness achieved lorenz system single beam approximately mile wide range two hundred miles array prohibitive size would required
