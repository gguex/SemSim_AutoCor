singular they is the use in english of the pronoun they or its inflected or derivative forms them their theirs and themselves or themself as an epicene gender neutral singular pronoun 
it typically occurs with an antecedent of indeterminate gender as in sentences such as 
the singular they had emerged by the th century and is common in everyday spoken english but its use has been the target of criticism since the late th century 
its use in formal english has increased with the trend toward gender inclusive language 
though the singular they permits a singular antecedent it is used with a plural verb form 
singular they has mostly the same inflected forms as the plural they i e 
them their and theirs with variation in the reflexive form 
the plural reflexive form themselves is sometimes used for the singular but there is an alternative singular reflexive form themself 
themself was common from the th to th centuries and its use has increased since about the s or s but it was classified by the edition of fowler s as a minority form and its use in standard dialect was described by the cambridge grammar of the english language as rare and acceptable only to a minority of speakers 
its use is thought to be increasing 
it is sometimes used when referring to a single person of indeterminate gender where the plural form themselves might seem incongruous as in 
the canadian government recommends themselves as the reflexive form of singular they for use in canadian federal legislative texts and advises against using themself but themself is also found 
they with a singular antecedent has remained in common use for centuries in spite of its proscription by traditional grammarians 
such use goes back to the middle english of the th century 
informal spoken english exhibits nearly universal use of the singular they 
an examination by jürgen gerner of the british national corpus published in found that british speakers regardless of social status age sex or region used the singular they overwhelmingly more often than the gender neutral he or other options 
preferring he as a gender neutral pronoun nineteenth century grammarians insisted on a singular pronoun on the grounds of number agreement while rejecting he or she as clumsy 
a recommendation to use the generic he rather than they in formal english can be found as early as the mid th century in ann fisher s a new grammar where she writes 
an grammar baskervill w m 
and sewell j w 
an english grammar for the use of high school academy and college class notes the common use of the singular they but recommends use of the generic he on the basis of number agreement 
baskervill gives a number of examples of recognized authors using the singular they including 
but prefers the use of he 
baskervill an english grammar in the british parliament passed an act which provided that when used in acts of parliament words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females 
it has been argued that the real motivation for promoting the generic he was an androcentric world view with the default sex of humans being male and the default gender therefore being masculine 
as wilson wrote in 
and poole wrote in 
in spite of continuous attempts on the part of educationalists to proscribe singular they in favour of he its use remained widespread and the advice was largely ignored even by writers of the period though the advice may have been observed more by american writers 
use of the purportedly gender neutral he remained acceptable until at least the s though some uses of he were later criticized as being awkward or silly for instance when referring to 
he is still sometimes found in contemporary writing when referring to a generic or indeterminate antecedent 
in some cases it is clear from the situation that the persons potentially referred to are likely to be male as in 
in some cases the antecedent may refer to persons who are only probably male or to occupations traditionally thought of as male 
in other situations the antecedent may refer to 
in we still find the use of generic he recommended 
in fowler s dictionary of modern english usage calls this the now outmoded use of he to mean anyone stating 
the earliest known attempt to create gender neutral pronouns dates back to when scottish economist james anderson advocated for an indeterminate pronoun ou 
in poet samuel taylor coleridge wrote whether we may not nay ought not to use a neutral pronoun relative or representative to the word person where it hath been used in the sense of homo mensch or noun of the common gender in order to avoid particularising man or woman or in order to express either sex indifferently 
if this be incorrect in syntax the whole use of the word person is lost in a number of instances or only retained by some stiff and strange position of the words as not letting the person be aware wherein offense has been given instead of wherein he or she has offended 
in my judgment both the specific intention and general etymon of person in such sentences fully authorise the use of it and which instead of he she him her who whom 
samuel taylor coleridge as written in anima poetæ from the unpublished note books of samuel taylor coleridge edited by ernest coleridge p 
in the second half of the th century people expressed more widespread concern at the use of sexist and male oriented language 
this included criticism of the use of man as a generic term to include men and women and of the use of he to refer to any human regardless of sex social gender 
it was argued that he could not sensibly be used as a generic pronoun understood to include men and women 
william safire in his on language column in the new york times approved of the use of generic he mentioning the mnemonic phrase the male embraces the female 
c badendyck from brooklyn wrote to the new york times in a reply 
by the movement had gained wide support and many organizations including most publishers had issued guidelines on the use of gender neutral language 
in some situations an individual may be known but referred to using the pronoun they 
this may occur because the individual s gender is unknown to the speaker or because the gender is non binary or genderqueer so that they regard both masculine and feminine pronouns as inappropriate and thus prefer to be referred to as they 
several social media applications permit account holders to choose to identify their gender using one of a variety of non binary or genderqueer options such as gender fluid agender or bigender and to designate a pronoun including they them which they wish to be used when referring to them 
though singular they has long been used with antecedents like everybody or generic persons of unknown gender this use which may be chosen by an individual is recent 
it was chosen by the american dialect society as the word of the year in the meaning gender neutral singular pronoun for a known person as a non binary identifier 
in the american dialect society wrote 
the vote followed the previous year s approval of this use by the washington post style guide when bill walsh the post s copy editor said that the singular they is the only sensible solution to english s lack of a gender neutral third person singular personal pronoun 
the use of masculine generic nouns and pronouns in written and spoken language has decreased since the s 
in a corpus of spontaneous speech collected in australia in the s singular they had become the most frequently used generic pronoun 
similarly a study from looking at a corpus of american and british newspapers showed a preference for they to be used rather than generic he or he or she as a singular epicene pronoun 
the increased use of singular they may owe in part to an increasing desire for gender neutral language 
a solution in formal writing has often been to write he or she or something similar but this is often considered awkward or overly politically correct particularly when used excessively 
in the journal american speech published a study by darren k lascotte investigating the pronouns used by native english speakers in informal written responses to questions concerning a subject of unspecified gender finding that of study participants chose singular they to refer to such an antecedent 
some participants noted that they found constructions such as he or she inadequate as they do not include people who do not identify as either male or female 
in contemporary usage singular they is used to refer to an indeterminate antecedent for instance when the notional gender or number of the antecedent is indeterminate or the gender of the real word entity referred to is unknown or unrevealed 
examples include different types of usage 
although the pronouns everybody everyone nobody and no one are singular in form and are used with a singular verb these pronouns have an implied plurality that is somewhat similar to the implied plurality of collective or group nouns such as crowd or team and in some sentences where the antecedent is one of these implied plural pronouns the word they can not be replaced by generic he suggesting a notional plural rather than a bound variable interpretation 
in contrast to sentences that involve multiple pairwise relationships and singular they such as 
there are examples where the antecedent pronoun such as everyone may refer to a collective with no necessary implication of pairwise relationships 
these are examples of plural they 
which are apparent because they do not work with a generic he or he or she 
in addition for these notional plural cases it would not be appropriate to use themself instead of themselves as in 
though both generic he and generic they have long histories of use and both are still used both are also systematically avoided by particular groups 
style guides that avoid expressing a preference for either approach sometimes recommend recasting a problem sentence for instance replacing generic expressions with plurals to avoid the criticisms of either party 
the use of singular they may be more accepted in british english than in american english or vice versa 
the handbook of nonsexist writing by casey miller and kate swift was first published in the united states 
because of differences in culture and vocabulary separate british editions have since been published 
these authors accept or recommend singular uses of they not just in cases where there is an element of semantic plurality expressed by a word such as everyone but also where an indeterminate person is referred to citing examples of such usage even in formal speech 
for instance they quote ronald reagan 
in addition to use of singular they they and others also suggest a number of ways to avoid the pronoun problem in gender neutral writing 
one strategy is to rewrite the sentence to use a plural they 
for instance in a newspaper story 
could have been changed to 
another strategy is to eliminate the pronoun so 
other methods of avoiding gender preference include recasting a sentence to use one or for babies it 
garner s modern american usage recommends cautious use of singular they and avoidance where possible because its use is stigmatized 
garner suggests that use of singular they is more acceptable in british english 
and apparently regrets the resistance by the american language community 
he regards the trend toward using singular they with antecedents like everybody anyone and somebody as inevitable 
in the th edition of the chicago manual of style the university of chicago press explicitly recommended using singular they and their noting a revival of this usage and citing its venerable use by such writers as addison austen chesterfield fielding ruskin scott and shakespeare 
from the th edition this was changed 
in chapter of the th edition now written by bryan a garner the recommendations are 
and according to the american heritage book of english usage many americans avoid use of they to refer to a singular antecedent out of respect for a traditional grammatical rule despite use of singular they by modern writers of note and mainstream publications 
the publication manual of the american psychological association explicitly reject the use of singular they and gives the following example as incorrect usage 
while also specifically taking the position that generic he is unacceptable 
the apa recommends using he or she recasting the sentence with a plural subject to allow correct use of they or simply rewriting the sentence to avoid issues with gender or number 
strunk white the authors of the elements of style find use of they with a singular antecedent unacceptable 
their assessment in was 
joseph m williams who wrote a number of books on writing with discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various solutions when faced with the problem of referring to an antecedent such as someone everyone no one or a noun that does not indicate gender and suggests that this will continue to be a problem for some time 
he suspect s that eventually we will accept the plural they as a correct singular but states that currently formal usage requires a singular pronoun 
according to the little brown handbook most experts and some teachers and employers find use of singular they unacceptable 
it recommends using he or she or avoiding the problem by rewriting the sentence to use a plural or omit the pronoun 
the purdue online writing lab owl maintains that singular they is incorrect 
the washington post style manual recommends trying to write around the problem perhaps by changing singulars to plurals before using the singular they as a last resort and specifically permits use of they for a gender nonconforming person 
the associated press stylebook recommends they them their is acceptable in limited cases as a singular and or gender neutral pronoun when alternative wording is overly awkward or clumsy 
however rewording usually is possible and always is preferable 
in the first edition of a dictionary of modern english usage published in it is stated that singular they is disapproved of by grammarians and should be avoided in favour of the generic he 
examples of its use by eminent writers are given but it is suggested that few good modern writers would flout grammarians so conspicuously as fielding and thackeray whose sentences are described as having an old fashioned sound 
in the second edition of fowler s fowler s modern english usage edited by sir ernest gowers and published in it is stated that singular they is disapproved of by grammarians and while common in colloquial speech should preferably be avoided in favour of the generic he in prose 
numerous examples of its use by eminent writers are given but it is still suggested that few good modern writers would flout grammarians so conspicuously as fielding and thackeray 
according to the third edition of fowler s the new fowler s modern english usage edited by burchfield and published in singular they has not only been widely used by good writers for centuries but is now generally accepted except by some conservative grammarians including the fowler of who ignored the evidence 
the complete plain words was originally written in by sir ernest gowers a civil servant in an attempt by the british civil service to improve official english 
a second edition edited by sir bruce fraser was published in 
it refers to they or them as the equivalent of a singular pronoun of common sex as common in speech and not unknown in serious writing but stigmatized by grammarians as usage grammatically indefensible 
the book s advice for official writers civil servants is to avoid its use and not to be tempted by its greater convenience though necessity may eventually force it into the category of accepted idiom 
a new edition of plain words revised and updated by sir ernest gowers great granddaughter rebecca gowers was published in 
it notes that singular they and them have become much more widespread since gowers original comments but still finds it safer to treat a sentence like the reader may toss their book aside as incorrect in formal english while rejecting even more strongly sentences like 
the times style and usage guide first published in by the times of london recommends avoiding sentences like 
by using a plural construction 
the cambridge guide to english usage finds singular they unremarkable 
it expresses several preferences 
the economist style guide refers to the use of they in sentences like 
as scrambled syntax that people adopt because they can not bring themselves to use a singular pronoun 
new hart s rules is aimed at those engaged in copy editing and the emphasis is on the formal elements of presentation including punctuation and typeface rather than on linguistic style but like the chicago manual of style makes occasional forays into matters of usage 
it advises against use of the purportedly gender neutral he and suggests cautious use of they where he or she presents problems 
the edition of the new international version bible uses singular they instead of the traditional he when translating pronouns that apply to both genders in the original greek or hebrew 
this decision was based on research by a commission that studied modern english usage and determined that singular they them their was by far the most common way that english language speakers and writers today refer back to singular antecedents such as whoever anyone somebody a person no one and the like 
according to a comprehensive grammar of the english language 
the cambridge grammar of the english language discusses the prescriptivist argument that they is a plural pronoun and that the use of they with a singular antecedent therefore violates the rule of agreement between antecedent and pronoun but takes the view that they though primarily plural can also be singular in a secondary extended sense comparable to the purportedly extended sense of he to include female gender 
use of singular they is stated to be particularly common even stylistically neutral with antecedents such as everyone someone and no one but more restricted when referring to common nouns as antecedents as in 
use of the pronoun themself is described as being rare and acceptable only to a minority of speakers while use of the morphologically plural themselves is considered problematic when referring to someone rather that everyone since only the latter implies a plural set 
there are also issues of grammatical acceptability when reflexive pronouns refer to singular noun phrases joined by or the following all being problematic 
on the motivation for using singular they a student s introduction to english grammar states the alternative he or she can be far too cumbersome as in 
or even flatly ungrammatical as in 
among younger speakers use of singular they even with definite noun phrase antecedents finds increasing acceptance sidestepping any presumption about the sex of the person referred to as in 
one explanation given for some uses of they referring to a singular antecedent is notional agreement when the antecedent is seen as semantically plural 
in other words in the shakespeare quotation a mother is syntactically singular but stands for all mothers and in the shaw quotation no man is syntactically singular demonstrated by taking the singular form goes but is semantically plural all go to kill not to be killed hence idiomatically requiring they 
such use which goes back a long way includes examples where the sex is known as in the above examples 
distributive constructions apply a single idea to multiple members of a group 
they are typically marked in english by words like each every and any 
the simplest examples are applied to groups of two and use words like either and or would you like tea or coffee 
since distributive constructions apply an idea relevant to each individual in the group rather than to the group as a whole they are most often conceived of as singular and a singular pronoun is used 
however many languages including english show ambivalence in this regard 
because distribution also requires a group with more than one member plural forms are sometimes used 
according to the traditional analysis english personal pronouns e g 
his her their are typically used to refer backward or forward within a sentence to a noun phrase which may be a simple noun 
this reference is called an anaphoric reference and the referring pronoun is termed an anaphor 
the so called singular they is morphologically plural and is accompanied by a plural verb 
however it is often used in circumstances where an indeterminate antecedent is signified by an indefinite singular antecedent for example 
in some sentences typically those including words like every or any the morphologically singular antecedent does not refer to a single entity but is anaphorically linked to the associated pronoun to indicate a set of pairwise relationships as in the sentence 
linguists like pinker and huddleston explain sentences like this and others in terms of bound variables a term borrowed from logic 
pinker prefers the terms quantifier and bound variable to antecedent and pronoun 
he suggests that pronouns used as variables in this way are more appropriately regarded as homonyms of the equivalent referential pronouns 
the word reference is traditionally used in two different senses 
the first sense of reference is also known in linguistics as a rhetorical tie halliday and hasan cohesion in english and the second sense of reference is understood in both linguistics and in philosophy of language as the relationship between a nominal group or noun phrase and an entity in a perceivable or imagined world 
with a morphologically singular antecedent there are a number of possibilities 
the following shows different types of anaphoric reference using various pronouns including they 
a study of whether singular they is more difficult to understand than gendered pronouns in search of gender neutrality is singular they a cognitively efficient substitute for generic he 
by foertsch and gernsbacher found that singular they is a cognitively efficient substitute for generic he or she particularly when the antecedent is nonreferential e g 
anybody a nurse or a truck driver rather than referring to a specific person e g 
a runner i knew or my nurse 
clauses with singular they were read just as quickly as clauses containing a gendered pronoun that matched the stereotype of the antecedent e g 
she for a nurse and he for a truck driver and much more quickly than clauses containing a gendered pronoun that went against the gender stereotype of the antecedent 
on the other hand when the pronoun they was used to refer to known individuals referential antecedents for which the gender was presumably known e g my nurse that truck driver a runner i knew reading was slowed when compared with use of a gendered pronoun consistent with the stereotypic gender e g 
he for a specific truck driver 
the study concluded that the increased use of singular they is not problematic for the majority of readers 
the singular and plural use of they can be compared with the pronoun you which originally was only plural but by about replaced thou for singular referents while retaining the plural verb form 
for you the singular reflexive pronoun yourself is different from its plural reflexive pronoun yourselves with they one can hear either themself or themselves for the singular reflexive pronoun 
singular they has also been compared to royal we also termed editorial we when a single person uses first person plural in place of first person singular pronouns 
similar to singular you its singular reflexive pronoun ourself is different from the plural reflexive pronoun ourselves 
the pronoun it which is typically used for inanimate objects can also be used for infants of unspecified gender but tends to be dehumanizing and is therefore more likely in a clinical context in a more personal context the use of it to refer to a person might indicate antipathy or other negative emotions 
it can also be used for non human animals of unspecified gender though they is common for pets and other domesticated animals of unspecified gender especially when referred to by a proper name e g 
rags snuggles 
it is uncommon to use singular they instead of it for something other than a life form
