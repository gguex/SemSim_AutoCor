at the age of anna fell while walking home from school in the rain and injured both ankles 
through mistreatment of the injury she became unable to walk or stand for any length of time for the rest of her life 
disabled and unable to walk she began learning about horses spending many hours driving her father to and from the station from which he commuted to work 
her dependence on horse drawn transportation fostered her respect for horses 
sewell s introduction to writing began in her youth when she helped edit the works of her mother mary wright sewell a deeply religious popular author of juvenile best sellers 
anna sewell never married or had children 
in visits to european spas she met many writers artists and philanthropists 
her only book was black beauty written between and in her house at old catton 
during this time her health was declining and she could barely get out of bed 
her dearly loved mother often had to help her in her illness 
she sold the book to the local publishers jarrold sons 
the book broke records for sales and is the sixth best seller in the english language 
by telling the story of a horse s life in the form of an autobiography and describing the world through the eyes of the horse anna sewell broke new literary ground 
sewell died of hepatitis or tuberculosis on april only five months after the novel was published but she lived long enough to see its initial success 
she was buried on april in the quaker burial ground at lammas near buxton norfolk where a wall plaque marks her resting place 
her birthplace in church plain great yarmouth is now a museum 
sewell did not write the novel for children 
she said that her purpose in writing the novel was to induce kindness sympathy and an understanding treatment of horses an influence she attributed to an essay on animals she read earlier by horace bushnell entitled essay on animals 
her sympathetic portrayal of the plight of working animals led to a vast outpouring of concern for animal welfare and is said to have been instrumental in the abolition of the cruel practice of using the checkrein or bearing rein a strap used to keep horses heads high fashionable in victorian england but painful and damaging to a horse s neck 
black beauty also mentions the use of blinkers on horses concluding that this use is likely to cause accidents at night due to interference with the full use of a horse s ability to see much better in the dark than men can 
the story is narrated in the first person as an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named black beauty beginning with his carefree days as a colt on an english farm with his mother to his difficult life pulling cabs in london to his happy retirement in the country 
along the way he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness 
each short chapter recounts an incident in black beauty s life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness sympathy and understanding treatment of horses with sewell s detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude 
the book describes conditions among london horse drawn taxicab drivers including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low legally fixed fares 
a page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published the difference between day taxicab licences not allowed to trade on sundays and day taxicab licences allowed to trade on sundays was abolished and the taxicab licence fee was much reduced 
sewell uses anthropomorphism in black beauty 
the text advocates fairer treatment of horses in victorian england 
the story is narrated from black beauty s perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the bearing rein and blinkers as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses 
for instance ginger describes the physical effects of the bearing rein to black beauty by stating it is dreadful your neck aching until you don t know how to bear it its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips 
tess coslett highlights that black beauty s story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves 
the horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics like love and loyalty which are similar to those of human beings 
coslett emphasises that while black beauty is not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography it is a novel that allows the reader to slide in and out of horse consciousness blurring the human animal divide 
upon publication of the book many readers related to the pain of the victimised horses sympathised and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well being of horses 
two years after the release of the novel one million copies of black beauty were in circulation in the united states 
in addition animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables 
the depiction of the bearing rein in black beauty spurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in victorian england but public interest in anti cruelty legislation in the united states also grew significantly 
the arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses in black beauty inspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals 
the impact of the novel is still very much recognised today 
writing in the encyclopedia of animal rights and animal welfare bernard unti calls black beauty the most influential anticruelty novel of all time 
comparisons have also been made between black beauty and the most important social protest novel in the united states uncle tom s cabin by harriet beecher stowe on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society 
black beauty was adapted for the stage in by playwright james stone 
the play was perform at the broughton hall estate north yorkshire and epsom racecourse surrey 
the production was a critical success and was performed around the uk in
