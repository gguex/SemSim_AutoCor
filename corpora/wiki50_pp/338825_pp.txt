toleration is the acceptance of an action object or person which one dislikes or disagrees with where one is in a position to disallow it but chooses not to 
it has also been defined as to bear or endure or to nourish sustain or preserve or as a fair objective and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions beliefs practices racial or ethnic origins etc differ from one s own freedom from bigotry too 
toleration may signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior mistaken or harmful 
there is only one verb to tolerate and one adjective tolerant but the two nouns tolerance and toleration have evolved slightly different meanings 
tolerance is a state of mind that implies non judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs whereas toleration indicates the act of putting up with something that one disapproves of 
historically most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion 
in the twentieth century and after analysis of the doctrine of toleration has been expanded to include political and ethnic groups lgbt individuals and other minorities and human rights embodies the principle of legally enforced toleration 
the word tolerance was first used in the th century 
the word is derived from endurance and fortitude used in the th century

as reported in the old testament the persian king cyrus the great was believed to have released the jews from captivity in bce and permitted their return to their homeland 
the hellenistic city of alexandria founded bce contained a large jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized greek and egyptian populations 
according to michael walzer the city provided a useful example of what we might think of as the imperial version of multiculturalism 
the roman empire encouraged conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods 
an important part of roman propaganda was its invitation to the gods of conquered territories to enjoy the benefits of worship within the imperium 
christians were singled out for persecution because of their own rejection of roman pantheism and refusal to honor the emperor as a god 
in ce roman emperor galerius issued a general edict of toleration of christianity in his own name and in those of licinius and constantine i who converted to christianity the following year 
in the old testament the books of exodus leviticus and deuteronomy make similar statements about the treatment of strangers 
for example exodus says thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him for ye were strangers in the land of egypt these texts are frequently used in sermons to plead for compassion and tolerance of those who are different from us and less powerful 
julia kristeva elucidated a philosophy of political and religious toleration based on all of our mutual identities as strangers 
the new testament parable of the tares which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time has also been invoked in support of religious toleration 
in his letter to bishop roger of chalons bishop wazo of liege c ad relied on the parable to argue that the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the lord comes to separate and judge them 
roger williams a baptist theologian and founder of rhode island used this parable to support government toleration of all of the weeds heretics in the world because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the wheat believers too 
instead williams believed it was god s duty to judge in the end not man s 
this parable lent further support to williams biblical philosophy of a wall of separation between church and state as described in his book the bloody tenent of persecution 
in the middle ages there were instances of toleration of particular groups 
the latin concept tolerantia was a highly developed political and judicial concept in mediaeval scholastic theology and canon law 
tolerantia was used to denote the self restraint of a civil power in the face of outsiders like infidels muslims or jews but also in the face of social groups like prostitutes and lepers 
heretics such as the cathari waldensians jan hus and his followers the hussites were persecuted 
later theologians belonging or reacting to the protestant reformation began discussion of the circumstances under which dissenting religious thought should be permitted 
toleration as a government sanctioned practice in christian countries the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies is not attested before the sixteenth century 
in poland in the statute of kalisz was issued guaranteeing freedom of religion for the jews in the country 
in pope clement vi issued a bull pleading with catholics not to murder jews whom they blamed for the black death 
he noted that jews died of the plague like anyone else and that the disease also flourished in areas where there were no jews 
christians who blamed and killed jews had been seduced by that liar the devil 
he took jews under his personal protection at avignon but his calls for other clergy to do so failed to be heeded 
johann reuchlin was a german humanist and a scholar of greek and hebrew who opposed efforts by johannes pfefferkorn backed by the dominicans of cologne to confiscate all religious texts from the jews as a first step towards their forcible conversion to the catholic religion 
despite occasional spontaneous episodes of pogroms and killings as during the black death polish lithuanian commonwealth was a relatively tolerant home for the jews in the medieval period 
in the statute of kalisz guaranteed safety personal liberties freedom of religion trade and travel to jews 
by the mid th century the polish lithuanian commonwealth was home to of the world s jewish population 
jewish worship was officially recognized with a chief rabbi originally appointed by the monarch 
jewish property ownership was also protected for much of the period and jews entered into business partnerships with members of the nobility 
paulus vladimiri ca 
was a polish scholar and rector who at the council of constance in presented a thesis tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium treatise on the power of the pope and the emperor respecting infidels 
in it he argued that pagan and christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the teutonic order for its wars of conquest of native non christian peoples in prussia and lithuania 
vladimiri strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations a forerunner of modern theories of human rights 
throughout his political diplomatic and university career he expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands 
desiderius erasmus roterodamus was a dutch renaissance humanist and catholic whose works laid a foundation for religious toleration 
for example in de libero arbitrio opposing certain views of martin luther erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language because in this way the truth which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived 
gary remer writes like cicero erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors 
although erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty 
he wrote it is better to cure a sick man than to kill him 
saint thomas more catholic lord chancellor of king henry viii and author described a world of almost complete religious toleration in utopia in which the utopians can hold various religious beliefs without persecution from the authorities 
however more s work is subject to various interpretations and it is not clear that he felt that earthly society should be conducted the same way as in utopia 
thus in his three years as lord chancellor more actively approved of the persecution of those who sought to undermine the catholic faith in england 
at the diet of worms martin luther refused to recant his beliefs citing freedom of conscience as his justification 
according to historian hermann august winkler the individual s freedom of conscience became the hallmark of protestantism 
luther was convinced that faith in jesus christ was the free gift of the holy spirit and could therefore not be forced on a person 
heresies could not be met with force but with preaching the gospel revealed in the bible 
luther heretics should not be overcome with fire but with written sermons 
in luther s view the worldly authorities were entitled to expel heretics 
only if they undermine the public order should they be executed 
later proponents of tolerance such as sebastian franck and sebastian castellio cited luther s position 
he had overcome at least for the protestant territories and countries the violent medieval criminal procedures of dealing with heretics 
but luther remained rooted in the middle ages insofar as he considered the anabaptists refusal to take oaths do military service and the rejection of private property by some anabaptist groups to be a political threat to the public order which would inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos 
so anabaptists were persecuted not only in catholic but also in lutheran and reformed territories 
however a number of protestant theologians such as john calvin martin bucer wolfgang capito and johannes brenz as well as landgrave philip of hesse opposed the execution of anabaptists 
ulrich zwingli demanded the expulsion of persons who did not accept the reformed beliefs in some cases the execution of anabaptist leaders 
the young michael servetus also defended tolerance since in his letters to johannes oecolampadius but during those years some protestant theologians such as bucer and capito publicly expressed they thought he should be persecuted 
the trial against servetus an antitrinitarian in geneva was not a case of church discipline but a criminal procedure based on the legal code of the holy roman empire 
denying the trinity doctrine was long considered to be the same as atheism in all churches 
the anabaptists made a considerable contribution to the development of tolerance in the early modern era by incessantly demanding freedom of conscience and standing up for it with their patient suffering 
sebastian castellio was a french protestant theologian who in published under a pseudonym the pamphlet whether heretics should be persecuted de haereticis an sint persequendi criticizing john calvin s execution of michael servetus when servetus fought with reasons and writings he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings 
castellio concluded we can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance 
even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time we can at any rate come to general understandings can love one another and can enter the bonds of peace pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith 
castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement to kill a man is not to protect a doctrine but it is to kill a man 
jean bodin was a french catholic jurist and political philosopher 
his latin work colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis the colloqium of the seven portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds a natural philosopher a calvinist a muslim a roman catholic a lutheran a jew and a skeptic 
all agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance 
michel de montaigne french catholic essayist and statesman moderated between the catholic and protestant sides in the wars of religion 
montaigne s theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we can not precipitously decide the error of other s views 
montaigne wrote in his famous essais it is putting a very high value on one s conjectures to have a man roasted alive because of them to kill people there must be sharp and brilliant clarity 
the polish lithuanian commonwealth has a long tradition of religious freedom 
the right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the commonwealth throughout the th and early th century however complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in the polish lithuanian commonwealth in during the warsaw confederation 
the commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of europe 
the warsaw confederation of was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in polish and lithuanian society in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance 
the confederation was incorporated into the henrican articles which constituted a virtual polish lithuanian constitution 
the edict of nantes issued on april by henry iv of france granted protestants notably calvinist huguenots substantial rights in a nation where catholicism was the state religion 
the main concern was civil unity the edict separated civil law from religious rights treated non catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time and opened a path for secularism and tolerance 
in offering general freedom of conscience to individuals the edict offered many specific concessions to the protestants such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights including the right to work in any field or for the state and to bring grievances directly to the king 
the edict marked the end of the religious wars in france that tore apart the population during the second half of the th century 
the edict of nantes was revoked in by king louis xiv with the edict of fontainebleau leading to renewed persecution of protestants in france 
although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of louis xv it was not until years later in when louis xvi signed the edict of versailles known as the edict of tolerance that civil status and rights to form congregations by protestants were restored 
beginning in the enlightenment commencing in the s politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept 
a distinction began to develop between civil tolerance concerned with the policy of the state towards religious dissent and ecclesiastical tolerance concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church 
john milton english protestant poet and essayist called in the areopagitica for the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties applied however only to the conflicting protestant denominations and not to atheists jews moslems or even catholics 
milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration 
rather than force a man s conscience government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel 
in roger williams and companions at the foundation of rhode island entered into a compact binding themselves to be obedient to the majority only in civil things 
williams spoke of democracie or popular government 
lucian johnston writes williams intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than then existed anywhere in the world outside of the colony of maryland 
in charles ii granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration 
also in congregationalist thomas hooker and a group of companions founded connecticut 
they combined the democratic form of government that had been developed by the separatist congregationalists in plymouth colony pilgrim fathers with unlimited freedom of conscience 
like martin luther hooker argued that as faith in jesus christ was the free gift of the holy spirit it could not be forced on a person 
in maryland passed the maryland toleration act also known as the act concerning religion a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian christians only excluding nontrinitarian faiths 
passed on september by the assembly of the maryland colony it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the british north american colonies 
the calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect catholic settlers and some of the other denominations that did not conform to the dominant anglicanism of england and her colonies 
in new amsterdam governed by dutch calvinists granted religious toleration to jews 
they had fled from portuguese persecution in brazil 
baruch spinoza was a dutch jewish philosopher 
he published the theological political treatise anonymously in arguing according to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy that the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the commonwealth but that the peace of the commonwealth and piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom and defending as a political ideal the tolerant secular and democratic polity 
after interpreting certain biblical texts spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction 
english philosopher john locke published a letter concerning toleration in 
locke s work appeared amidst a fear that catholicism might be taking over england and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer 
unlike thomas hobbes who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well functioning civil society locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest 
in his opinion civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate s attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced rather than tolerating their proliferation 
however locke denies religious tolerance for catholics for political reasons and also for atheists because promises covenants and oaths which are the bonds of human society can have no hold upon an atheist 
a passage locke later added to the essay concerning human understanding questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience 
pierre bayle was a french protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in holland 
in his dictionnaire historique and critique and commentaire philosophique he advanced arguments for religious toleration though like some others of his time he was not anxious to extend the same protection to catholics he would to differing protestant sects 
among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church 
bayle wrote that the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth 
bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence one must transcribe almost the whole new testament to collect all the proofs it affords us of that gentleness and long suffering which constitute the distinguishing and essential character of the gospel 
he did not regard toleration as a danger to the state but to the contrary if the multiplicity of religions prejudices the state it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of persecution 
in a word all the mischief arises not from toleration but from the want of it 
the act of toleration adopted by the british parliament in allowed freedom of worship to nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and rejected transubstantiation 
the nonconformists were protestants who dissented from the church of england such as baptists and congregationalists 
they were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance 
the act did not apply to catholics and non trinitarians and continued the existing social and political disabilities for dissenters including their exclusion from political office and also from universities 
françois marie arouet the french writer historian and philosopher known as voltaire published his treatise on toleration in 
in it he attacked religious views but also said it does not require great art or magnificently trained eloquence to prove that christians should tolerate each other 
i however am going further i say that we should regard all men as our brothers 
the turk my brother 
the chinaman my brother 
the jew 
the siam 
yes without doubt are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same god 
on the other hand voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the christian religion and orthodox rabbi joseph telushkin has claimed that the most significant of enlightenment hostility against judaism was found in voltaire 
gotthold ephraim lessing german dramatist and philosopher trusted in a christianity of reason in which human reason initiated by criticism and dissent would develop even without help by divine revelation 
his plays about jewish characters and themes such as die juden and nathan der weise have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration 
the latter work contains the famous parable of the three rings in which three sons represent the three abrahamic religions christianity judaism and islam 
each son believes he has the one true ring passed down by their father but judgment on which is correct is reserved to god 
the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen adopted by the national constituent assembly during the french revolution states in article no one shall be interfered with for his opinions even religious ones provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law 
nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions mêmes religieuses pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l ordre public établi par la loi 
the first amendment to the united states constitution ratified along with the rest of the bill of rights on december included the following words congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof 
in thomas jefferson wrote a letter to the danbury baptists association in which he said 
i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church state 
in his essay what is a nation 
french historian and philosopher ernest renan proposed a definition of nationhood based on a spiritual principle involving shared memories rather than a common religious racial or linguistic heritage 
thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the life of the nation 
you can be french english german yet catholic protestant jewish or practicing no religion 
in the united nations general assembly adopted article of the universal declaration of human rights which states 
even though not formally legally binding the declaration has been adopted in or influenced many national constitutions since 
it also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international regional national and sub national institutions protecting and promoting human rights including the freedom of religion 
in the roman catholic church vatican ii council issued the decree dignitatis humanae religious freedom that states that all people must have the right to religious freedom 
in the first world day of prayer for peace was held in assisi 
representatives of one hundred and twenty different religions came together for prayer to their god or gods 
in in the spirit of glasnost soviet premier mikhail gorbachev promised increased religious toleration 
the rigveda says ekam sath viprah bahudha vadanti which translates to the truth is one but sages call it by different names 
consistent with this tradition india chose to be a secular country even though it was divided partitioning on religious lines 
whatever intolerance hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith 
traditionally hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts 
hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which showed remarkable tolerance towards other religions in difficult times and under testing conditions 
even buddhism which spread in india mostly through negative campaigns against hinduism can not claim that credit 
criticizing other religions and showing them in poor light to attract converts to its own fold was never an approved practice in hinduism 
pluralism and tolerance of diversity are built into hindu theology india s long history is a testimony to its tolerance of religious diversity 
christianity came to india with st thomas in the first century ce long before it became popular in the west 
judaism came to india after the jewish temple was destroyed by the romans in ce and the jews were expelled from their homeland 
in a recent book titled who are the jews of india 
university of california press author nathan katz observes that india is the only country where the jews were not persecuted 
the indian chapter is one of the happiest of the jewish diaspora 
both christians and jews have existed in a predominant hindu india for centuries without being persecuted 
zoroastrians from persia present day iran entered india in the th century to flee islamic conquest 
they are known as parsis in india 
the parsis are an affluent community in the city of mumbai without a sense of having been persecuted through the centuries 
among the richest business families in india are the parsis for example the tata family controls a huge industrial empire in various parts of the country 
mrs indira gandhi the powerful prime minister of india was married to feroz gandhi a parsi no relation to mahatma gandhi 
certain verses of the qur an were interpreted to create a specially tolerated status for people of the book jewish and christian believers in the old and new testaments considered to have been a basis for islamic religion 
those who believe and those who are jews and christians and sabians whoever believes in god and the last day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve 
under islamic law jews and christians were considered dhimmis a legal status inferior to that of a muslim but superior to that of other non muslims 
jewish communities in the ottoman empire held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion as did christians 
yitzhak sarfati born in germany became the chief rabbi of edirne and wrote a letter inviting european jews to settle in the ottoman empire in which he asked is it not better for you to live under muslims than under christians 
sultan beyazid ii issued a formal invitation to the jews expelled from catholic spain and portugal leading to a wave of jewish immigration 
according to michael walzer 
the established religion of the ottoman empire was islam but three other religious communities greek orthodox armenian orthodox and jewish were permitted to form autonomous organizations 
these three were equal among themselves without regard to their relative numerical strength 
they were subject to the same restrictions vis à vis muslims with regard to dress proselytizing and intermarriage for example and were allowed the same legal control over their own members 
although bhikkhu bodhi states that the buddha taught the path to the supreme goal of the holy life is made known only in his own teaching buddhists have nevertheless shown significant tolerance for other religions buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms 
james freeman clarke said in ten great religions the buddhists have founded no inquisition they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our western experience 
the edicts of ashoka issued by king ashoka the great bce a buddhist declared ethnic and religious tolerance 
his edict xii engraved in stone stated the faiths of others all deserve to be honored for one reason or another 
by honoring them one exalts one s own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of others 
however buddhism has also had controversies regarding toleration 
see dorje shugden controversy 
in addition the question of possible intolerance among buddhists in sri lanka and myanmar primarily against muslims has been raised by paul fuller 
the development of new digital technologies has resulted in an exponential growth in the volume of information and knowledge available and made them more readily accessible to greater numbers of people throughout the world 
as such information and communication technologies can play an essential role in the sharing of knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainable development and in a spirit of solidarity 
and yet for many observers the world is witnessing rising levels of ethnic cultural and religious intolerance often using the same communication technologies for ideological and political mobilization to promote exclusivist worldviews 
this mobilization often leads to further criminal and political violence and to armed conflict 
this also leads to new modes of intolerance such as cyberbullying 
contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards national law the principles of national identity or other strongly held goals 
michael walzer notes that the british in india tolerated the hindu practice of suttee ritual burning of a widow until 
on the other hand the united states declined to tolerate the mormon practice of polygamy 
the french head scarf controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the french secular ideal 
toleration of the romani people in european countries is a continuing issue 
historian alexandra walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word toleration may be very different from its historic meaning 
toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or libertarian view of human rights 
hans oberdiek writes as long as no one is harmed or no one s fundamental rights are violated the state should keep hands off tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting deplorable or even debased 
this for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals 
it is found for example in the writings of american philosophers john rawls robert nozick ronald dworkin brian barry and a canadian will kymlicka among others 
isaiah berlin attributes to herbert butterfield the notion that toleration implies a certain disrespect 
i tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts though i know them to be absurd and foolish 
mill would i think have agreed 
john gray states that when we tolerate a practice a belief or a character trait we let something be that we judge to be undesirable false or at least inferior our toleration expresses the conviction that despite its badness the object of toleration should be left alone 
however according to gray new liberalism the liberalism of rawls dworkin ackerman and suchlike seems to imply that it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of or against any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good 
john rawls theory of political liberalism conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity 
diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing what rawls calls overlapping consensus individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or comprehensive schemes will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration 
herbert marcuse wrote repressive tolerance in where he argued that the pure tolerance that permits all favors totalitarianism democracy and tyranny of the majority and insisted the repressive tolerance against them 
as a result of his public debate with baron devlin on the role of the criminal law in enforcing moral norms british legal philosopher h l a hart wrote law liberty and morality and the morality of the criminal law 
his work on the relationship between law and morality had a significant effect on the laws of great britain helping bring about the decriminalization of homosexuality 
but it was jeremy bentham that defended the rights for homosexuality with his essay offence against one s self but could not be published until in 
walzer karl popper and john rawls have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance 
walzer asks should we tolerate the intolerant 
he notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant at least in some respects 
rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society 
he links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will over time acquire the tolerance of the wider society 
toleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism either the claim self referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it 
if we are skeptical about knowledge then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good 
ronald dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society 
dworkin has also questioned whether the united states is a tolerant secular nation or is re characterizing itself as a tolerant religious nation based on the increasing re introduction of religious themes into conservative politics 
dworkin concludes that the tolerant secular model is preferable although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model 
in the end of faith sam harris asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality spirituality politics and the origin of humanity especially beliefs which promote violence
