legio x fretensis tenth legion of the strait was a legion of the imperial roman army 
it was founded by the young gaius octavius later to become augustus caesar in bc to fight during the period of civil war that started the dissolution of the roman republic 
x fretensis is then recorded to have existed at least until the s 
x fretensis symbols were the bull the holy animal of the goddess venus mythical ancestor of the gens julia a ship probably a reference to the battles of naulochus and or actium the god neptune and a boar 
the symbol of taurus may also mean that it was organized between april and may 
octavian later known as augustus levied a legion and gave it the number ten as a reference to julius caesar s famous tenth legion 
in bc the tenth legion fought under octavian against sextus pompey in the battle of naulochus where it earned its cognomen fretensis 
the name refers to the fact that the battle took place near the sea strait of messina fretum siculum 
in bc it fought in the battle of actium against mark antony 
although actium was a battle at sea the legion was able to board enemy ships that had been hooked close by means of an iron grapnel known as the corvus 
its key participation in this battle is probably the reason that the legion also used a trireme as one of its symbols 
actium marked the end of the civil war and the rise to power of octavian who was proclaimed augustus some years later 
tiles found in caesarea maritima built in the second decade bc suggest that the legion was at that time based in judea 
later x fretensis moved to syria 
in it was stationed in that province together with legions iii gallica vi ferrata and xii fulminata 
in the same year publius sulpicius quirinus governor of syria led these legions in the suppression of the revolt that sprung out after the deposition of herod archelaus 
under nero in x fretensis participated in the campaigns of gnaeus domitius corbulo against the parthians 
x fretensis was centrally involved in the first jewish roman war under the supreme command of vespasian 
in the x fretensis and v macedonica went to alexandria for an invasion of ethiopia planned by nero 
however the two legions were needed in judaea to suppress a revolt 
after spending the winter in ptolemais ace modern acre israel x fretensis and v macedonica relocated in the coastal city of caesarea maritima 
this was due to the large number of legions being mobilized in ptolemais under marcus ulpius traianus future governor of syria and father of the emperor trajan 
during that same winter the caesarea camp of xth and vth hosted vespasian who was forced to go to rome the following year where he seized power 
vespasian s son titus finished the suppression of the revolt 
when tarichacae and gamla were conquered the x fretensis moved to scythopolis modern bet she an just west of the jordan river 
in the summer of x fretensis destroyed the monastery of qumran where the dead sea scrolls are believed to have originated 
its winter camp was at jericho 
by the rebellion in all of judaea had been crushed except for jerusalem and a few fortresses including masada 
in that year x fretensis in conjunction with v macedonica xii fulminata and xv apollinaris began the siege of jerusalem stronghold of the rebellion 
the xth camped on the mount of olives 
during the siege legio x gained fame in the effective use of their various war machines 
it was noted that they were able to hurl stones that weighted a talent about kg a distance of two furlongs m or further 
the projectiles of their ballistae caused heavy damage to the ramparts 
according to josephus vol 
iii of his history of judaean war larcius lepidus was the commanding officer of the x legion 
the siege of jerusalem lasted five months and the besieged population experienced all the terrible rigors of starvation 
finally the combined assaults of the legions succeeded in taking the city which was then subjected to destruction 
during the spring of titus set sail for rome 
a new military governor was then appointed from rome lucilius bassus whose assigned task was to undertake the mopping up operations in judea 
naturally he used x fretensis to oppose the few remaining fortresses that still resisted 
as part of this x fretensis took herodium and then crossed the jordan to capture the fortress of machaerus on the shore of the dead sea 
due to illness bassus did not live to complete his mission 
lucius flavius silva replaced him and moved against the last jewish stronghold masada in the autumn of 
he used legio x auxiliary troops and thousands of jewish prisoners 
after his orders for surrender were rejected silva established several base camps and a wall of circumvallation completely around the fortress 
when the romans finally broke through the walls of this citadel they discovered that the jewish defenders had chosen death with a mass suicide 
after the conclusion of the jewish revolt legio x was garrisoned at jerusalem 
their main camp was positioned on the western hill located in the southern half of what is now the old city which had been levelled of all former buildings 
the camp of the tenth was built using the surviving portions of the walls of herod s palace demolished by order of titus 
the camp was at the end of the cardo maximus of aelia capitolina 
at the time legio x was the sole legion assigned to maintain the peace in judaea and was directly under the command of the governor of the province who was also legatus of the legion 
after participating in trajan s parthian campaign fretensis was caught up in the bar kokhba s revolt 
a possible cause for the revolt was the decision of emperor hadrian to build a pagan temple to jupiter in jerusalem 
simon bar kokhba started the revolt and inflicted massive casualties on the romans 
the war ended when the roman army including fretensis and danubian troops under the command of sextus julius severus reconquered the entire territory and successfully besieged the last jewish stronghold the fortress of betar 
as a consequence of the unrest in the region fretensis was supported by a several more legions of which the legio vi ferrata was stationed at a camp which became known lejjun form legion 
a vexillatio of fretensis fought in the marcomannic campaign of marcus aurelius 
in the legion supported pescennius niger against septimius severus and was possibly involved in a local struggle between jews and samaritans 
the legion was still in jerusalem at the time of caracalla or elagabalus 
under gallienus fretensis was employed in the war against the gallic empire 
the legion moved to aila close to modern aqaba probably during diocletian s reforms and is recorded as still camping there at the time of the compilation of the notitia dignitatum in the s when it is reported serving under the dux palaestinae 
a latin inscription of the end of the nd century found in the church of abu ghosh at km west of jerusalem marks the presence of a vexillatio detachment of x fretensis 
some fragments bearing the l x f mark of the l egio x f retensis are present at the tower of david in jerusalem 
roman law required all pottery to bear the maker s stamp and the legion pottery works just to the west of jerusalem were obviously no exception 
a huge production of pottery bearing the marks of the legio x fretensis has been discovered in jerusalem 
the mark le x fr was also used in the pottery of the legion
