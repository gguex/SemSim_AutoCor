the naugatuck river is a river in the u s state of connecticut 
its waters carve out the naugatuck river valley in the western reaches of the state flowing generally due south and eventually emptying into the housatonic river at derby connecticut and thence to long island sound 
the plume and atwood dam in thomaston completed in following the great flood of creates a reservoir on the river and is the last barrier to salmon and trout migrating up from the sea 
various algonquian bands often included in the wappinger tribe originally inhabited the naugatuck river valley 
in fact the name naugatuck is derived from an algonquian term meaning lone tree by the fishing place 
one early th century author explained that this name originally referred to a specific tree along the river in the area of modern day beacon falls but came to be applied broadly to the entire river over time 
the valley was later settled in the th century by english colonists 
given its rocky soil which was not good for farming and the high potential for water power the naugatuck valley became an industrialized area in the th century 
it has been associated with the brass and copper industries 
after winding through rural forested areas the two branches of the naugatuck river enter downtown torrington and join just north of east albert street at about above sea level 
the east branch of the naugatuck river is long and originates in winchester as a tributary of lake winchester at an elevation of about 
the west branch long begins at the confluence of jakes brook hart brook and hall meadow brook in the western part of torrington at an elevation of 
from this point on the naugatuck river has been followed by early paths and roadways through the time of development of connecticut route 
the river enters a forested hilly area between connecticut route and thomaston 
the largely industrialized cities of the naugatuck river valley were developed on each side of the river with periodic sections of forested areas before it enters the housatonic river at derby at about above sea level 
as part of the housatonic river watershed the naugatuck river historically hosted the southernmost atlantic salmon salmo salar migrations 
historical runs of anadromous fish also included native american shad alosa sapidissima connecticut s state fish alewife alosa pseudoharengus and blueback herring alosa aestivalis 
dam construction for hydropower cooling and rinse water and boiler water for industry began circa and continued during the industrial revolution of the s 
these dams as well as wastewater from the towns that grew up around factories along the river contributed to the extirpation of many species of fish 
over time and with the closing of many of the factories the dams ceased to provide hydropower or serve any other economic purpose 
the anaconda dam waterbury freight street dam waterbury union city dam naugatuck and the platts mill dam naugatuck were removed in while the kinneytown dam was bypassed with a fish ladder that same year 
the chase brass dam between waterbury and thomaston was removed in 
a fish bypass channel the first of its kind in new england now permits fish to migrate past the tingue dam and opens an additional of the river to anadromous fish migration 
the installation of the fish bypass on the tingue dam in seymour leaves only the plume and atwood dam in thomaston as the last barrier on the river to fish migration 
the state of connecticut department of energy and environmental protection deep stocks surplus atlantic salmon salmo salar from the connecticut river restoration effort in the naugatuck river each fall 
deep also stocks several salmonid species including native brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and non native sea run brown trout salmo trutta and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss 
the naugatuck river is a popular destination for fishing in northwestern connecticut though not on the same scale as the farmington or housatonic rivers 
the connecticut department of environmental protection stocks the river with broodstock atlantic salmon between route in harwinton litchfield and the thomaston dam and from southern naugatuck to beacon falls 
the naugatuck has a trout management area between route and the thomaston dam 
it is considered a trophy trout stream the rest of its length between the confluence of the east and west branches and the kinneytown dam in seymour 
landmarks of note associated with the naugatuck include reynolds bridge an open spandrel concrete arch bridge in thomaston which carries waterbury road over the river 
built in the crossing is listed on the national register of historic places
