it was expanded from his short story your appointment will be yesterday first published in the august edition of amazing stories 
the novel describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves old birth living their lives in reverse and eventually returning to the womb where they split into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man 
the story takes place in a then future fictional and centers on anarch peak a black religious leader who had died in and is expected to rise soon 
sebastian hermes an owner of a small vitarium a business that digs up the dead and gives them the treatment they need before returning them to society discovers peak s resurrection is imminent 
after accidentally discovering the burial place of peak he decides against the law to dig up the body before the anarch awakes 
as with contemporary controversies about brain death it seems not to be judged morally significant if a heartbeat can be heard but it is illegal to dig anyone up before they start talking which suggests resumed brain function is a marker of old birth 
various groups are interested in controlling the affairs of the old born such as the vitaria technically a person resurrected is in the legal custody of their vitarium until claimed by family members and the library an organization dedicated to erasing books which have passed beyond the initial date at which they were written 
religious institutions are also interested in old birth particularly in the resurrection of anarch peak in the case of the udites an african american religion and the rome syndicate the highest authority in caucasian matters as well as the owner of numerous religious artifacts and other items like a syringe that can stop the hobart phase for short periods of time 
these factions then argue over the ownership of anarch peak after his resurrection 
when the library kidnaps anarch peak both factions send sebastian hermes to recover him 
in the end peak is killed and there may be an interracial war as a consequence of peak s permanent death 
the hobart phase is the new order of life where people rise from the dead and are rejuvenated 
time reversal apparently began in 
other than aging hobart phase resurrection has changed nutritional and excretion processes and associated social taboos 
people do not eat but instead consume sogum anally through a pipe and later plop out food orally which is done in private due to its shameful nature 
as for smoking cigarettes are no longer smoked but the smoke instead blown back into them making them grow back to normal size this also clears and freshens the air 
goodbye and hello have reversed their order within standard greetings and food is used as a drop in replacement for the expletive shit 
it is stated that mars colonists do not have the hobart phase on their world and it is limited to earth and presumably its lunar colonies as well 
as hinted in the book the united states of america has been partitioned into eastern and western segments 
hawaii and alaska have also seceded from the wus and fnm but this is only mentioned in passing 
in the wus western united states california is predominantly white while the eastern free negro municipality fnm is inhabited by african americans 
the fictitious religion of uditi is the national religion of the east 
uditi is an offshoot of christianity with apparent influences from roman catholicism and the rastafari movement and is centered on the udi an experience of a group mind 
inhabitants of the wus view the religion with suspicion and it is hinted that their media demonizes its adherents 
library sanctioned murders and civil unrest are claimed to be the works of religious fanatics 
fnm currency is claimed to be worthless as is wus currency stated earlier in the book but its citizens ignore this due to patriotism
