a turncoat is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party 
in political and social history this is distinct from being a traitor as the switch mostly takes place under the following circumstances 
from a military perspective opposing armies generally wear uniforms of contrasting colors to prevent incidents of friendly fire 
thus the term turn coat indicates that an individual has changed sides and his uniform coat to one matching the color of his former enemy 
for example in the english civil war during the th century oliver cromwell s soldiers turned their coats inside out to match the colours of the royal army see examples below 
even in a modern historical context turncoat is often synonymous with the term renegade a term of religious origins having its origins in the latin word renegare to deny 
historical currents of great magnitude have periodically caught masses of people along with their leaders in their wake 
in such a dire situation new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal treason becomes muddled 
one example would be the situation that led to the act of abjuration or plakkaat van verlatinghe signed on july in the netherlands an instance where changing sides was given a positive meaning 
the first written use of the term meaning was by j foxe in actes monumentes in one who changes his principles or party a renegade an apostate 
cited turncoat could also have a more literal origin 
according to the rotuli chartarum two barons changed fealty from william marshal st earl of pembroke to king john 
in other words they turned their coats of arms from one lord to another hence turncoat 
a mass shift in allegiance by a population may take place during military occupation after a nation has been defeated in war or after a major social upheaval such as a revolution 
following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the area in question quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system 
this shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one 
in the face of fear and insecurity the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival 
often the leaders are the first to change loyalties for they have had access to privileged information and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause 
this is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events 
as time goes by along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of burying and rewriting the past by concealing evidence 
the fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat 
the past is rewritten and whitewashed to cover former deeds 
when successful this activity results in the distortion and falsification of historical events 
even after the death of a turncoat his family and friends may wish to keep uncomfortable secrets from the past out of the light 
there is a fear of loss of prestige as well as a wish to honor the memory of a family member from the part of those who have experienced the positive side of the person 
in certain countries individuals and organizations have actively investigated the past to bring turncoats to justice to face their responsibilities
