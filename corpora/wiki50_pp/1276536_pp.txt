the victorian goldfields railway is a broad gauge tourist railway in victoria australia 
it operates along a formerly disused branch line between the towns of maldon and castlemaine 
the original line was opened on june opening up rail access from the established station at castlemaine to the towns of muckleford and maldon 
the area was prosperous as castlemaine and maldon had both experienced gold rushes in the preceding years and local residents had been petitioning the state government for a railway since 
on august a contract was let for an extension to laanecoorie however further construction was suspended after the line reached the small town of shelbourne in 
the line was served by twice daily trains for the first forty years of its life which was increased to four times daily trains in 
however these were cut back at the end of the s due to a decrease in the local population and passenger services were eliminated altogether during world war ii 
this meant that the line was only used by a weekly goods train which went through to shelbourne 
when bushfire damage caused the closure of the shelbourne extension in the remainder of the line was rendered largely useless and it was officially closed in december 
the response to the closure from the local community was swift and the castlemaine and maldon railway preservation society was founded in the same month with the intention of reopening the line as a tourist railway 
while maldon station was intact and was able to be used as a base for their operations they were faced with numerous problems a line that needed substantial repairs a lack of rolling stock and rebuilding the demolished station at muckleford 
over the next decade volunteers obtained and renovated rolling stock and by trains were able to operate on a one kilometre section of track out of maldon 
by the line from muckleford to maldon had been restored with the platforms being reinstated and a small replacement building being constructed 
services were able to operate along a regular timetable and the society set about reopening the muckleford castlemaine section of the line 
the project received the support of the local state and federal governments 
the necessary physical work had largely been completed by but it took another year to secure the necessary approvals and sign an agreement with freight operator pacific national over the use of its line into castlemaine station which is still in regular passenger use today 
the section of line finally opened on december approximately a year behind schedule 
the society has shown no plans to restore the dismantled shelbourne extension in the foreseeable future 
the railway now operates two return trips to castlemaine on sundays wednesdays public holidays
