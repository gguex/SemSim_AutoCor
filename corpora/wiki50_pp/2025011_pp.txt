under feudalism in england during the mediaeval era tenure by serjeanty was a form of tenure in return for some specified non standard service thus distinguishing it from knight service 
it is also used of similar forms in continental europe 
the word comes from the french noun sergent itself from the latin serviens servientis serving the present participle of the verb servo to keep preserve save rescue deliver 
sergeant is derived from the same source though developing an entirely different meaning 
serjeanty originated in the assignation of an estate in land on condition of the performance of a certain duty other than knight service usually the discharge of duties in the household of the king or a noble 
it ranged from non standard service in the king s army distinguished only by equipment from that of the knight to petty renders for example the rendering of a quantity of basic food such as a goose scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent paying tenant or socager 
the legal historians pollock and maitland described it as being a free servantship in the sense that the serjeant whatever his task was essentially a menial servant 
however the feudal historian round objected that their definition does not cover military serjeanties and glosses over the honorific value of at least some of the services 
the historian mary bateson stated as follows concerning serjeanties 
they were neither always military nor always agricultural but might approach very closely the service of knights or the service of farmers 
the serjeanty of holding the king s head when he made a rough passage across the channel of pulling a rope when his vessel landed of counting his chessmen on christmas day of bringing fuel to his castle of doing his carpentry of finding his pot herbs of forging his irons for his ploughs of tending his garden of nursing the hounds gored and injured in the hunt of serving as veterinary to his sick falcons such and many others might be the ceremonial or menial services due from a given serjeanty 
the varieties of serjeanty were later increased by lawyers who the sake of convenience categorised under this head such duties as escort service to the abbess of barking or of military service on the welsh border by the men of archenfield 
serjeants servientes already appear as a distinct class in the domesday book of though not in all cases differentiated from the barons who held by knight service 
a few mediaeval tenures by serjeanty can be definitely traced as far back as domesday in the case of three hampshire serjeanties those of acting as king s marshal of finding an archer for his service and of keeping the gaol in winchester castle 
it is probable however that many supposed tenures by serjeanty were not really such although so described in returns in inquisitions post mortems and other records 
the simplest legal test of the tenure was that serjeants though liable to the feudal exactions of wardship etc were not liable to scutage they made in place of this exaction special composition with the crown 
some of the domesday book tenants may have been serjeants before the norman conquest in the time of king edward the confessor 
for instance a certain siward accipitrarius from latin accipiter hawk presumably hawker to edward the confessor held from the king an estate worth Â£ in somerset and did so in an area appropriate to his occupation close to a water habitat 
j h 
round ascribed the development of serjeanties in england to norman influence though he did not dismiss earlier roots 
the anglo saxon historian james campbell has suggested that serjeanties such as the messenger services recorded in the th century may represent semi fossilised remnants of important parts of the anglo saxon governmental system 
the germ of the later distinction between grand french grand large and petty french petit small serjeanty is found in the magna carta of the king there renouncing the right of prerogative wardship in the case of those who held of him by the render of small articles 
the legal doctrine which developed that serjeanties were inalienable i e 
non transferrable and impartible led during the reign of king henry iii to the arrentation of those serjeanties the lands of which had been partly alienated which were thereby converted into socage tenures i e 
paying money rents or in some cases tenures by knight service 
gradually the gulf widened and petty serjeanties consisting of renders together with serjeanties held of mesne lords sank into socage while grand serjeanties the holders of which performed their service in person became alone liable to the burden of wardship and marriage 
in littleton s tenures th century this distinction appears as well defined but the development was one of legal theory 
by the reign of king edward i tenure by serjeanty was well on the retreat as kimball observes 
once it began to give way serjeanty disintegrated more quickly and easily than the other tenures as the feudal conception of society lost its hold its miscellaneous services had many fates 
a large number soon became obsolete others were commuted to money payments or changed to knight s service a few that were honourable or ornamental were retained in their original form as part of the coronation ceremony 
some being still useful were performed by deputy or absorbed into the regular administrative system 
when the military tenure of knight service was abolished at the restoration of the monarchy by king charles ii that of grand serjeanty was retained doubtless on account of its honorary character it being then limited in practice to the performance of certain duties at coronations the discharge of which as a right has always been coveted and the earliest record of which is that of the coronation of queen eleanor of provence in 
the most conspicuous are those of queen s champion appurtenant to the manor of scrivelsby long held by the dymoke family and of supporting the king s right arm appurtenant to the manor of worksop 
the duty of supporting the king s right arm was still performed at the coronation of king edward vii in 
the meaning of serjeant as a household officer is still preserved in the monarch s serjeants at arms serjeant surgeons and serjeant trumpeter 
the horse and foot serjeants servientes of the king s army in the th century who ranked after the knights and were more lightly armed were unconnected with land tenure 
serjeanty is to be distinguished from offices held hereditarily in gross 
these are not serjeanties as they were not incidents of the tenure of a manor or other land 
they are heritable in the same way as baronies by writ so that they can pass to a daughter where there is no male heir and be split between daughters as co heiresses if there are several
