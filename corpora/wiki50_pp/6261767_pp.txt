bob s full house was a popular and influential quiz programme hosted by bob monkhouse which was based on the popular game bingo 
it aired on bbc from september until january 
four players were given separate bingo style cards and attempted to light up the numbers on them by answering questions 
cards had three rows of six spaces each with one space per row already blanked out to leave numbers showing 
numbers on the cards ran from to 
the winner of each round received their choice of three prizes that increased in value from one round to the next 
each episode began with a lengthy topical stand up comedy routine from monkhouse 
in this round monkhouse asked toss up questions on the buzzer open to all 
a correct answer allowed a player to light up the number in one corner of their card while a miss caused them to become penalized or wallied in this case unable to buzz in on the next question 
the first player to light all four corners of their card won the round 
the players were shown a board with six categories each corresponding to a range of consecutive numbers 
each player in turn called a number off their own middle row and was asked a question unopposed in the corresponding category 
a correct answer lit the number but a miss allowed any of the other three to buzz in described by monkhouse as open to others 
a correct buzz in allowed that player to light any number on their own middle row while a miss caused them to become wallied 
if a wallied player was next in line to choose a number they lost their turn otherwise they could not buzz in on the next question in case of a miss 
the categories were changed out at times throughout the round 
the first player to complete their middle row won the round 
in addition one number on each card was secretly designated as a lucky number 
if the player in control chose their own lucky number and responded correctly they won a bonus prize which was revealed as part of a short comedy sketch or in connection with a worthless joke prize 
e g 
a contestant might win a carrot and a glass of lemon juice then be told that they could pick up this prize during a weekend at a health farm 
gameplay proceeded as in round one but the goal was now to fill in all unlit numbers on the cards 
numbers were lit starting on a player s top row and proceeding left to right then similarly on the middle and bottom rows 
the first player to complete their card won the game and advanced to the bonus round 
any players who finished the game without winning any prizes received a hamper of gifts as a consolation prize 
the player faced an electronic board laid out in the same manner as the cards used in the main game with one space in each row marked off and numbers from to in the others 
they had seconds to answer up to questions 
the clock kept running on a pass or miss but each correct answer stopped the clock and allowed the player to choose one number to be removed from the board 
some numbers had letters hidden behind them that spelled out the name of a holiday destination while all others added their value in pounds to a bank 
if the player uncovered all the letters they won a holiday to that destination if not they received a small consolation prize 
regardless of the outcome they won all the money in the bank 
monkhouse frequently offered subtle hints to help players who were struggling with questions such as bleating like a goat to lead a player to the astrological sign of capricorn 
the letters were arranged in order from left to right in each row and a player who figured out the destination could narrow down the possible locations of the missing letters
