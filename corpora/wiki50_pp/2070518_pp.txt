the record of the existence of košice dating from is connected with the existence of the rectory church 
in the process of the settlement s transformation from a rural community into a town all its periods of successes and failures have been reflected in st elisabeth s cathedral 
according to historical and archaeological sources the present day cathedral was built on the place of the older temple which was consecrated to st elisabeth as well 
it was referred to in the document of pope martin v in the year and in the letter of which stated that the bishop of eger andrew ii exempted košice parish from the dean s sphere of jurisdiction

the church is long and wide the height of the north tower is 
the central nave is m long and aisles are m long 
construction of the church influenced builders activity in surrounding towns such as prešov bardejov sabinov rožňava and it also influenced construction of other churches in poland and transylvania 
the gothic cathedral of košice consists of the choir with a five side chavet five naves two towers a level sacristy at the north side and two chapels and antechapel at the south side 
there is a unique inside layout of the church where the central nave and four aisles are crossed in the middle by one transept of the same height and width as the central nave which altogether create a greek cross 
this big central space rises in the centre of the church and together with three equal exterior gables with richly decorated portals belong to the acme of medieval stone work of art in the middle europe 
the complex of the cathedral and adjacent buildings st michael chapel and urban tower were declared as cultural heritage monuments in 
the oldest košice church probably originated in the middle of the th century and was sacred to st michael 
it was built in romanesque style at the same place as the current church 
the church is referred to in the oldest written records of the town dated 
when german colonists settled in košice in the s and st elisabeth became the town s patron saint the church was rededicated to her 
after this change the church started to be adjusted in the gothic style in the middle of the th century 
the church retained the romanesque tower but it also got a gothic vault and an ending of a temple 
the temple oriented to the east was × m and its main aisle was × m the whole space was 
this parish church burned down around but it was rebuilt and kept in service until the construction of the current cathedral 
several romanesque artifacts such as iva statuette a bronze baptistery and the several gravestones remain up to this day 
the fire which destroyed st elisabeth church in was a good opportunity for the construction of a new church 
rich local citizens financed the construction of a cathedral with the active support of monarch sigismund lucemburgh 
he devoted a considerable amount of money to the construction 
building of a church was also supported by papal curia 
in pope bonifac ix issued the indulgence bull 
all pilgrims who contributed to košice ´s church had their sins forgiven 
the exact date of a new church construction is unknown but it is supposed to be between fire of old church and when there was a first written record 
the first stage of construction works lasted probably until 
in this period the church was built as a five nave basilica 
the construction was done in a way that new cathedral was built around the original foundation 
the south polygonal chevet of aisles were built as the first ones 
this was followed by the south enclosure wall construction the south portal and the west wall where first two levels of both towers were composed to floor plan of church 
an advanced construction margin related to silesian gothic which took part in the franciscan church construction in the north part of town was working at building of a new church 
there exists a reference from about director mikulas and about sigismund´s master builder peter from budin 
a discontinuous innovation in a cathedral conception was brought by new construction masonry in 
because of a lack of written reference the architect of construction masonry is anonymous 
ambition of uprightness light materials and spaciousness of church resulted in construction of the three aisle cathedral whereby the essential change of plan was added by the counter aisles to the main nave 
this was situated unconventionally to the middle of the main nave length by which a unique central hall space was created 
the statue portal decoration of a main nave and side aisles were inspired by gothic buildings in prague and kraków and was included in the second construction stage 
the influence of parleř masonry at prague´s saint vitus cathedral in the second half of the th century became evident in the king´s oratory and its spiral staircase as well as a motif of round banisters of oratory and a stone gallery over the sacristy 
then building of the cathedral continued with the north external wall construction the polygonal chevet of the north aisle parallels of south apsids and eight sided top levels of the sigimund tower 
at the end of the second construction stage the cathedral was ready for vaulting and it was necessary to pull down the old church 
st michael´s church today called chapel was built at the same time as the new church but it was finished in and it took over the function of a parish church 
after the demolition of the old church of st elisabeth the church was vaulted by stellar vault 
the particular symmetric shapes of the vault bays were different from each other and they were not folded from one bay to the other 
the newest part of the construction sacristy and temple belong to this third construction stage 
the sigimund s tower was finished and a new town erb granted by ladislaus the posthumous was sculpted at the fifth floor of tower in 
the date which is sculpted over the entrance portal to the tower is the year when work on the tower was finished 
after finishing the sigimund tower all attention was given to the building of the south tower which was named after the monarch of that time and contributor to the building of tower matthias corvinus 
this tower was built in a more decorated and vertical style than the north tower of the cathedral because the construction masonry had changed 
at the same time the south shield and portal were finished and there are many elements that recognize matthias generosity 
during the period between and master stephan lapicidus or master steffen staimecz from košice mentioned in documents was working on the cathedral construction 
master stephan built side aisles of the cathedral that were not included in an origin floor plan 
it was financed by rich city dweller families 
the saint cross chapel was built by senator august cromer in 
the saint maria chapel was built by satmary rod in and by the end of the same century the saint joseph chapel which no longer exists was built at the north side of the cathedral 
an inside feature from this period is a work of master stephan the stone pastophorium and probably the relief of st elizabeth at the sacristy wall as well 
at that time the church was furnished by rich gothic mobiliari from which not too much was kept until today 
the main altar of st elisabeth from the years of from the unknown artist has been preserved 
after matthias corvinus death began the contest of the throne in hungary 
at that time polish latvia regent john i albert attacked košice city 
it was the first time that košice was shot by cannons 
the church was heavily damaged and mikuláš krumpholz from nis was charged with its reconstruction 
master builder vaclav from prague assisted him with the reconstruction 
according to the documents from the era at cordon of the west façade the reconstruction was done between 
during the years the sigimund tower timber of roof and singboard were fixed 
the tower also got a clock 
in the presbytery was completed this is considered to be the year when the cathedral construction was finished 
this fact is documented by the scroll of parchment with the particular year and the name of master builder krumholz which was found in the presbytery pillar after the big reconstruction of the church in 
in košice was affected by a huge fire which damaged the cathedral as well 
the church roof timbers of the roof and a large part of interior were burnt 
all the necessary repairs were done by master builder stanislaus from kraków builder masters johann and gebriel and stone master matyas 
after this the church was administered by protestants 
they owned the church until when it was violently garrisoned by catholics and eger´s chapter house 
this incident became one of the main reason of anti habsburg revolt of stephen bocskai who devoted the church to calvins 
the church was returned to eger´s chapter house in by emperor leopold i s decision 
during this time the necessary repairs were done and a chapter house treasure was placed in the church 
in the period of imre thököly s revolt in the church was again owned by protestants 
in the church was definitely and permanently owned by catholics 
in the church was damaged during the francis ii rákóczi occupation 
the most damaged parts were the west and the south side of the church 
during the th century several parts of the church were fixed and embellished 
in the second half of the th century the church already had altars with comparison to the that exist today 
baroque rococo helmit with sightseeing view obtained the sigimund´s tower after the fire in 
after several years of religious wars and neglected maintenance it was necessary to update the cathedral at the beginning of the th century 
there were earthquakes in and in the town was flooded and the flood extended to the cathedral where several parts of the ground pavement were damaged 
during the th century there was an initiative for the cathedral reconstruction in neo gothic style which was organised by bishop ignac fabry and imrich henszimann an artist and monuments innovator in hungary 
in st elisabeth cathedral alliance was established by the members who were devoted to cathedral repairs which took place during under the control of the emperor s royal central commission of preservation and repair of architectural monuments and as well as under the assistance of henszlmann 
works were laid out by master builders karol gerster and ladislav frey 
the fabry s reconstruction effected change of several portals statues clapboards to ceramic roof tiles stock of new window panes repair of the south hall and romantique interior painting 
on the other hand very important structural defects of the church which were evident at that time were not removed and repaired 
some of the columns were off center from their central line 
their bases were standing on a colour blade layer which was soaked by ground water 
arch ruptures were covered by mortar or were covered by wood 
such an unprofessional practise led to the destruction and state of disrepair after a big windstorm in 
in the hungarian temporary monuments commission was established with imrich henszlmann was the commission secretary 
a major reconstruction was realized between and was the main priority of the monuments commission 
it was financed mostly from the state budget of the hungarian government 
imrich steindl a professor of medieval architecture of budapest technical university and the most famous architect of the hungarian neo gothic was named as the main architect of the reconstruction works 
based on the ruptures in arches he decided that pillars allocation in the aisles was the main reason for the state of a disrepair of the cathedral statics 
he worked out a completely new purist projection of the cathedral s reconstruction where the three aisle cathedral was rebuilt to a five aisle cathedral and added arches in side aisles 
originally medieval star arches at the main as well as the side aisles were rebuilt to network ones 
an old choir was removed and on its place steindl built expanded replicas with more pillars 
the next works involved the exterior adjusting the external walls and gavels supporting the columns the water chutes and windows carved works the portals decoration and the change of matthias tower roof 
a late gothic chapel of st joseph at the north part of the cathedral was completely removed 
a neo gothic tower which was crossing the main and the side aisles flèche was created 
steindl s primary plan was to rebuild all the neo gothic additional building and components in the cathedral 
but those suggestions were declined by the commission and they requested a cheaper exchange of old stone parts for the new ones 
re gothic re gothisation of towers was not realized due to lack of money 
this was reflected in a cheaper construction material 
during the exchange of a base system in cheap but low quality sandstone from the nearby stone pit spiššké vlachy was used 
its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians 
with the next reconstruction after good quality sandstone from banská bystrica was used 
the main master builder of the major reconstruction in was josepf weber 
in friedrich wilhelm fröde from wien was the main master builder 
supervision was done by austrian architect friedrich von schmidt 
after that a famous architect schmidt s student imrich steindl had started to work on budapest parliament in and otto sztehló became his successor 
this architect used a preservative method at the matthias tower in contrast with the previous purist method of his forerunners 
the sigimund tower the matthias tower except the roof the inner side of exterior walls the medieval portals with reliefs the stone inventory of interior and the whole temple just the interior part were kept from neo gothic reconstruction 
in a newly delivered neo gothic interior equipment altars statues pictures was bought and donated for košice s cathedral by hungarian clergy košice bishop and maecenas zigmund bubics 
in a cathedral crypt was built under the north side aisle according to project of frigyes schulek 
this crypt was prepared for enclosing relics of francis ii rákóczi and his companions from turkey 
in the area of st elisabeth cathedral was declared a national cultural monument 
all the profiled architectural features pinnacles gargoyles gadroons had been either destroyed by the rain water or were unmounted 
the stone decoration at the north portal was very much affected by weathering 
cathedral reconstruction started again in september with detailed architectural documentation 
after a short break works started again in 
in the meantime authorities started with the complex solution of košice centrum monuments innovation which was in declared as the biggest town monuments reservation in slovakia 
one of the factors that contributed to higher care of church was excluding motor vehicle traffic from the main street in and tram traffic in 
during the reconstruction it was decided to use a method of a maintaining the stage from the big reconstruction at the end of the th century 
first the roof of the main and side aisles was repaired where the ceramic coloured enamel tiles were changed but with the original pattern from the th century 
the flèche was reconstructed and it was necessary to add pieces of lead decorations 
from the most damaged part of the temple and sacristy were reconstructed 
the works were done by polish company pracownie konserwacji zabytkow from vratislaw 
it was necessary to construct the new crown gardoons gargoyles and pinnacles according to the accessible documents and projects from the town s archival collection 
similarly the staircase towers were done 
the gargoyles reconstruction was done according to original medieval patterns which are retained in the museums 
this reconstruction included the interior repair of a temple 
in the south façade cleaning and preservation including windowpanes was done 
the sigimund s tower was under consistent renovation in when a rococo copper helmit was replaced 
cleaned and gilded plumbing decorations are originals from 
in reconstruction of the rakoczy crypt was finished and in reconstruction of the most precious north portal was finished 
today there is renovation work at the exterior of the north façade of the church and the west portal and interior of the crossed north aisle 
the matthias tower is awaiting reconstruction 
the base of the space composition is formed by the central nave with five bays which is divided by the cross aisle with one bay in axis 
apparent substitution of an idea are four subordinate spaces inset into the ground plan of the building and inserted between the arms of main and cross aisle 
in the first decades probably the enclosure walls were built and the main outline of space disposition was finished 
in the next few years the question of portals and arches construction should have been solved 
in the original spirit of the architecture the excellent stone sculpture works between enriched construction structure with three big portals 
the north the south and west portals in košice have difficult profiles eventuated in dynamic curves alternating by horizontal and vertical cornices of relief boards and were decoratively enriched by pinnacles 
those architectural works through profile ceiling and allow new ideas using decorative views and play of light and shadow 
as is seen from the reconstruction of v mencl the conception of the figural vaulting is based on individual parts of split arcades curves and inter vault parts 
their shapes difficult play is formed by the scheme of the sun rising with its spikes out of the splitting columns 
for each sun an individual pattern of its middle is very important 
from its diagonal vectors it creates shapes of the cross rhombus and the trapezoid 
in the subordinate spaces which are clutched by the arms of main greek cross of the main aisle and the side aisle at connecting walls and the east side the sun scheme is lost in a tangle of cranked rib networks 
master štefan built a sacrarium over the anteroom at the south wall and he is adding adoration to the chapel of st cross to its east side and chapel of mettercia to the west side 
at the north side there is the chapel of st joseph 
in these parts the ribs do not reach the head of the lisena but they gather to the arch construction 
the vaulting of the chapels is based on an irregular star net vault 
master ján of prešov demolished old walls and suggested an atrial type which can be seen mostly at the triple aisle 
as from the artistic point of view he used efficiency of the smooth walls and the large windows in order to whiten the interior 
this altar was crafted in the period of and is ranked among the most remarkable monuments of medieval art in slovakia 
the two pairs of both side decorated wings each containing six gothic paintings are adjoined to the central part

like the main altar of saint elisabeth the upper part of this altarpiece is late gothic 
it is decorated with the three groups of sculptures the legend of three marriages of saint anne statues of the apostles and of mary on the top

they are of high quality with a notable impact of the dutch and flemish renaissance 
an original gothic altarpiece which was not installed in 
only the predella was preserved which is lost in the archival store of the cathedral 
the roman gothic baptistery from the th century is the oldest monument preserved in the cathedral

the leg of the baptistery is decorated with triangles and the chalice is ornamented with zoomorphic reliefs of lions gryphons and eagles 
the upper brim is lined with an illegible latin inscription 
the lid dates back to

a new pipe organ was crafted by angster from patkostolie 
access to it is through a stairway in the southern tower 
the original one was discovered on košice by a collector austrian count johann nepomuk wilczek who bought it and had it transported to his castle burg kreuzenstein near vienna 
a stone pastophorium for storing the eucharist which is located in the northern pillar of triumphal arch is the most accurate stone masonry work in the cathedral 
it was crafted by master stefan around 
the pastophorium with hexagonal plan is ornated with complex composition of pillars moldings friezes arcades and arches 
the twisted niche for storing the eucharist is located on the first floor of pastophorium 
the metal tipped door decorated with thumbnails of coat of arms of some lands and noblemen dates back to the th century 
the tiny plaster sculptures of prophets and kneeling angels replaced former missing parts in the end of the th century 
since the council of trent the pastophorium lost its function and the staircase leading to the pastophorium therefore lost its purpose and was removed in 
it originated in the same period as the stone pastophorium and the authorship is also attributed to stefan 
it is made of three parts which do not fit together because of their compositions 
the relief by itself is decorated in abrupt manner in a contrast with hexagonal ciborium with bolt ending with filigree scenes from the old testament

one of the two chapels in the cathedral is the chapel of annunciation to the blessed virgin mary located in the area between matthias corvinus tower and the vestibule of the southern portal 
it was built in by stefan and allegedly his portrait is on the console of cross ribbed vaults 
the builder holds a paper strip in his hands 
the altarpiece of mettercia is installed in the chapel hence the other name 
parents of the hungarian primate juraj szatmary had it built hence the chapel is also called the chapel of szatmary 
in the beginning of the th century a crypt of bishops of košice was established under its floor 
their gravestones are embedded into the enclosure walls 
ignac fabry zigmund bubics augustin fischer colbrie and jozef carsky are buried here 
the second chapel of the dome is the chapel of saint cross also built in year 
its donor was the city consul and reeve augustín cromer the reason that the chapel is also called cromer s chapel 
nowadays it is used as the sacristy 
to the period of building the old cathedral belongs the construction of the king s oratory 
it was created on the first floor of the polygonal arch of the south annex of transept aisle 
on the wall under the oratory is a very significant epigrafic relic from the acting time of john jiskra from brandys in the function of košice captain 
the twisted staircase is from the th century and leads to the king s empora 
the stairs are divided into two arms of staircase and the west arm heads to the attic of cathedral 
it is constrained and therefore it is assumed it had mainly decorative function 
this twisted staircase is the oldest existing one in europe 
the stone gallery located on the north wall of the main aisle in place of a presbytery belongs to the original accommodation of the cathedral 
its purpose was likely to present different medieval allegories and mysteries during the worship ceremony by actors and singers 
saint florian was the patron of firemen and protection from fire 
the town built his statue in which first stood near the st michael chapel later on near the south wall of st urban tower until the year when it was moved to where it now stands at the entrance hall of the south portal 
building of the adyton belongs to the third part of construction of the dome the years 
in addition there are neo gothic statues on the consoles from jana marschalek from the end of th century 
they represent saints 
windowpanes were created by karl geyling in wien in 
on the panes are illustrated coats of arms of minor canons 
the newest element of the cathedral s inventory is the sacrificial altar of the celebrating priest 
it is located in the front of the main altar and is carved from a single piece of sandstone in the shape of two arms creating an ellipse 
the sacrificial altar stands on the tabernacle of the shape of a heart 
near the altar is a new ambon place for preaching and the sedeses chairs 
all the three objects were created by michael and thomas baník in 
the stone pulpit with wooden shelter is the masterpiece of sculptors w aubram and r argenti 
on the twisted staircase to it are placed statues of the argurs and the church fathers 
beside the north wall of the dome a crypt was built in for remains of francis ii rákoczi and his family and favored friends 
the crypt and the four stone sarcophagi were designed by professor frigyes schulek from budapest 
in one sarcophagus are buried together the prince his mother helen zrínska and his older son joseph 
south from him is the sarcophagus of general count anton esterházi north from his is buried mikuláš šibrik and in the fourth sarcophagus on the other side of crypt is buried count mikuláč berčéni and his second wife kristína čáki 
the monumental mural painting above the north portal of the cathedral is from years and its author is andor dudics 
it is a triptych 
design of the north portal is rare according to medieval tradition in which the north sides of churches did not have portals 
its statues are the most decorative out of the three portals of the cathedral 
the reason for this is probably its facing the busiest part of medieval košice to the city market and the city hall 
the portal is known as the golden gate because it was gilded in the middle ages 
the north portal has two entrance doors 
above those is an arch with a relief of the last judgement 
the relief is divided into two parts 
in the lower one is seen a crowd of people heading to the gates of heaven where they are welcomed by an angel and the others who are going to hell are heading to the leviathan s jaws with devils and are in chains 
the upper part shows the last judgement the two angels with horns announcing the end of the world 
the other figures represent the apostles 
around the relief of the last judgement is in three degrees placed five frame reliefs decorated by pinnacles profilation and traceried motives 
two lower reliefs refer to the life of st elisabeth 
the other three recreate the scene from calvary 
at the top is christ crucified on the cross in a shape of tree of life 
the other two crucified on golgotha are shown on the left side as the saved soul carried to heaven by an angel while on the right side the soul is carried to hell by a devil 
under the scene of crucifixion on the left side are crying women around virgin mary under the cross and on the right side is john the evangelist surrounded by roman soldiers 
during the great reconstruction of the dome they added niches along the both gates of north portal for neo gothic statues of the saints 
the niches are original and it is not known what statues stood on them during the last centuries 
the other neo gothic statues decorate the portal of the east gavel 
the statues are ugarian kings charles i of hungary his wife elisabeth of poland and luuis of hungary 
they are masterpieces of the budapest sculptor ľudovít lantay 
according to liturgical custom the main entrance to the church is the west portal 
although it has three gates this entrance has the most simple stone decoration 
two sides are without figure decoration 
above the main gate are two reliefs 
one of them directly over the gate shows christ in getsemane garden piteously praying to his father 
to the left of christ are apostles peter john and jacob from the right come soldiers led by judas 
in the seddle finish of the portal is the scene of pieta virgin mary holding christ body surrounded by maria magdalene and mary joseph 
the uppermost relief shows angels holding veronica s towel with christ s face print 
the whole symbology of portals relates with local tradition of the holy blood 
at the end of th century two neo gothic statues were placed to the main gate of which only one the statue of john the baptist has been preserved 
the south portal differs from the previous two portals by the fact that it is placed to the ante room under the king s empora 
it has two gates the same as the north portal but without the figures in relief 
instead they are finished by saddles with triangle circling pikes above which is another row of saddles 
the portal gives the impression of a triple level entrance to the cathedral 
an interesting component of the portal is aerial bolt of gothic arch of an ante room with leaf ornaments 
very interesting is also the baldachin of the statue in the middle of the portal which is formed by flying rooks 
the other rook and beast hold devices of the torment 
based on this it is supposed that under the baldachin was previously a statue of christ 
today there is statue of imaculata from the end of the th century made by statue maker john marschalko
