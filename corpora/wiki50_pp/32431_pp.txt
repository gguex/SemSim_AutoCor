vanadium is a chemical element with symbol v and atomic number 
it is a hard silvery grey ductile and malleable transition metal 
the elemental metal is rarely found in nature but once isolated artificially the formation of an oxide layer passivation stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation 
andrés manuel del río discovered compounds of vanadium in in mexico by analyzing a new lead bearing mineral he called brown lead and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element which he named erythronium derived from greek for red since upon heating most of the salts turned red 
four years later however he was erroneously convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium 
chlorides of vanadium were generated in by nils gabriel sefström who thereby proved that a new element was involved which he named vanadium after the scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility vanadís freyja 
both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds 
del rio s lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for its vanadium content 
in henry enfield roscoe obtained the pure element 
vanadium occurs naturally in about different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits 
it is produced in china and russia from steel smelter slag other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil or as a byproduct of uranium mining 
it is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels 
the most important industrial vanadium compound vanadium pentoxide is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid 
large amounts of vanadium ions are found in a few organisms possibly as a toxin 
the oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity 
particularly in the ocean vanadium is used by some life forms as an active center of enzymes such as the vanadium bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae 
vanadium was discovered by andrés manuel del río a spanish mexican mineralogist in 
del río extracted the element from a sample of mexican brown lead ore later named vanadinite 
he found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors and as a result he named the element panchromium greek παγχρώμιο all colors 
later del río renamed the element erythronium greek ερυθρός red because most of the salts turned red upon heating 
in the french chemist hippolyte victor collet descotils backed by del río s friend baron alexander von humboldt incorrectly declared that del río s new element was only an impure sample of chromium 
del río accepted collet descotils statement and retracted his claim 
in the swedish chemist nils gabriel sefström rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores 
later that same year friedrich wöhler confirmed del río s earlier work 
sefström chose a name beginning with v which had not been assigned to any element yet 
he called the element vanadium after old norse vanadís another name for the norse vanr goddess freyja whose attributes include beauty and fertility because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces 
in the geologist george william featherstonhaugh suggested that vanadium should be renamed rionium after del río but this suggestion was not followed 
the isolation of vanadium metal proved difficult 
in berzelius reported the production of the metal but henry enfield roscoe showed that berzelius had in fact produced the nitride vanadium nitride vn 
roscoe eventually produced the metal in by reduction of vanadium ii chloride vcl with hydrogen 
in pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium 
the first large scale industrial use of vanadium was in the steel alloy chassis of the ford model t inspired by french race cars 
vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength ca 
german chemist martin henze discovered vanadium in the blood cells or coelomic cells of ascidiacea sea squirts in 
vanadium is a medium hard ductile steel blue metal 
some sources describe vanadium as soft perhaps because it is ductile malleable and not brittle 
vanadium is harder than most metals and steels see hardnesses of the elements data page and iron 
it has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids 
it is oxidized in air at about k °c °f although an oxide passivation layer forms even at room temperature 
naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable isotope v and one radioactive isotope v the latter has a half life of × years and a natural abundance of 
v has a nuclear spin of which is useful for nmr spectroscopy 
twenty four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized ranging in mass number from to 
the most stable of these isotopes are v with a half life of days and v with a half life of days 
the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives shorter than an hour most below seconds 
at least four isotopes have metastable excited states 
electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than v for the heavier ones the most common mode is beta decay 
the electron capture reactions lead to the formation of element titanium isotopes while beta decay leads to element chromium isotopes 
the chemistry of vanadium is noteworthy for the accessibility of the four adjacent oxidation states 
in aqueous solution vanadium forms metal aquo complexes of which the colours are lilac v ho green v ho blue vo ho yellow vo 
vanadium ii compounds are reducing agents and vanadium v compounds are oxidizing agents 
vanadium iv compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives which contain the vo center 
ammonium vanadate v nhvo can be successively reduced with elemental zinc to obtain the different colors of vanadium in these four oxidation states 
lower oxidation states occur in compounds such as v co and substituted derivatives 
the most commercially important compound is vanadium pentoxide 
it is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid 
this compound oxidizes sulfur dioxide to the trioxide 
in this redox reaction sulfur is oxidized from to and vanadium is reduced from to 
the catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air 
similar oxidations are used in the production of maleic anhydride phthalic anhydride and several other bulk organic compounds 
the vanadium redox battery utilizes all four oxidation states one electrode uses the couple and the other uses the couple 
conversion of these oxidation states is illustrated by the reduction of a strongly acidic solution of a vanadium v compound with zinc dust or amalgam 
the initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion vo ho is replaced by the blue color of vo ho followed by the green color of v ho and then the violet color of v ho

at lower ph s the monomer hvo and dimer vo are formed with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than c m pv where pv is equal to the minus value of the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration m 
the formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the dichromate ion 
as the ph is reduced further protonation and condensation to polyvanadates occur at ph hvo is predominant at pv greater than ca 
while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed 
between ph decavanadate predominates its formation from orthovanadate is represented by this condensation reaction 
in decavanadate each v v center is surrounded by six oxide ligands 
vanadic acid hvo exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species hvo results in the preferential formation of the octahedral vo ho species 
in strongly acidic solutions ph 
vo ho is the predominant species while the oxide vo precipitates from solution at high concentrations 
the oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid

those of v iv and v v are oxidants 
vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than as is the case in v cn 
oxovanadium v also forms coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations 
the coordination chemistry of v is dominated by the vanadyl center vo which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly the one trans to the vanadyl center 
an example is vanadyl acetylacetonate v o och 
in this complex the vanadium is coordinate square pyramidal meaning that a sixth ligand such as pyridine may be attached though the association constant of this process is small 
many coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry such as vocl nme 
the coordination chemistry of v is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium iv precursors indicating the stability of the oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the and states
