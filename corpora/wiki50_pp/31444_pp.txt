thealogy a neologism derived from ancient greek meaning goddess and logy meaning study of is generally understood as a discourse that reflects upon the meaning of goddess thea in contrast to god theo 
as such it is the study and reflection upon the feminine divine from a feminist perspective 
thealogy is distinguished from feminist theology which is the study of god from a feminist perspective but the two fields can be seen as related and interdependent 
the term s origin and initial use is open to continuing debate 
patricia iolana traces the early use of the neologism to crediting both valerie saiving and isaac bonewits for its initial use 
there has tended to be an emphasis on the coinage of thealogian on record by bonewits in 
in the the changing of the gods naomi goldenberg introduces the term as a future possibility with respect to a distinct discourse highlighting the masculine nature of theology 
also in in the first revised edition of real magic bonewits defined thealogy in his glossary as intellectual speculations concerning the nature of the goddess and her relations to the world in general and humans in particular rational explanations of religious doctrines practices and beliefs which may or may not bear any connection to any religion as actually conceived and practiced by the majority of its members 
also in the same glossary he defined theology with nearly identical words changing the feminine pronouns with masculine pronouns appropriately 
carol p christ used the term in laughter of aphrodite claiming that those creating thealogy could not avoid being influenced by the categories and questions posed in christian and jewish theologies 
she further defined thealogy in her essay feminist theology as post traditional thealogy as the reflection on the meaning of the goddess 
in her essay on mirrors mists and murmurs toward an asian american thealogy rita nakashima brock defined thealogy as the work of women reflecting on their experiences of and beliefs about divine reality 
also in ursula king notes thealogy s growing usage as a fundamental departure from traditional male oriented theology characterized by its privileging of symbols over rational explanation 
in charlotte caron s inclusive and clear definition of thealogy as reflection on the divine in feminine and feminist terms appeared in to make and make again 
by this time the concept had gained considerable status among goddess adherents 
situated in relationship to the fields of theology and religious studies thealogy is a discourse that critically engages the beliefs wisdom practices questions and values of the goddess community both past and present 
similar to theology thealogy grapples with questions of meaning include reflecting on the nature of the divine the relationship of humanity to the environment the relationship between the spiritual and sexual self and the nature of belief 
however in contrast to theology which often focuses on an exclusively logical and empirical discourse thealogy embraces a postmodern discourse of personal experience and complexity 
the term suggests a feminist approach to theism and the context of god and gender within paganism neopaganism goddess spirituality and various nature based religions 
however thealogy can be described as religiously pluralistic as thealogians come from various religious backgrounds that are often hybrid in nature 
in addition to pagans neopagans and goddess centred faith traditions they are also christian jewish buddhist muslim quakers etc 
or define themselves as spiritual feminists 
as such the term thealogy has also been used by feminists within mainstream monotheistic religions describe in more detail the feminine aspect of a monotheistic deity or trinity such as god dess herself or the heavenly mother of the latter day saint movement 
in melissa raphael wrote the text introducing thealogy discourse on the goddess for the series introductions in feminist theology 
written for an academic audience it purports to introduce the main elements of thealogy within the context of goddess feminism 
she situates thealogy as a discourse that can be engaged with by goddess feminists those who are feminist adherents of the goddess who may have left their church synagogue or mosque or those who may still belong to their originally established religion 
in the book raphael compares and contrasts thealogy with the goddess movement 
in paul reid bowen wrote the text goddess as nature towards a philosophical thealogy which can be regarded as another systematic approach to thealogy but which integrates philosophical discourse 
in the past decade other thealogians like patricia iolana and d vorah grenn have generated discourses that bridge thealogy with other academic disciplines 
iolana s jungian thealogy bridges analytical psychology with thealogy and grenn s metaformic thealogy is a bridge between matriarchal studies and thealogy 
contemporary thealogians include carol p christ melissa raphael asphodel long beverly clack charlotte caron naomi goldenberg paul reid bowen rita nakashima brock and patricia iolana 
at least one christian theologist dismisses thealogy as the creation of a new deity made up by radical feminists 
paul reid bowen and chaone mallory point out that essentialism is a problematic slippery slope when goddess feminists argue that women are inherently better than men or inherently closer to the goddess 
in his book goddess unmasked the rise of neopagan feminist spirituality philip g davis levies a number of criticisms against the goddess movement including logical fallacies hypocrisies and essentialism 
thealogy has also been criticized for its objection to empiricism and reason 
in this critique thealogy is seen as flawed by rejecting a purely empirical worldview for a purely relativistic one 
meanwhile scholars like harding and haraway seek a middle ground of feminist empiricism
