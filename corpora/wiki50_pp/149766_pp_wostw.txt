first implementation standalone disk based language system seattle computer products bus cpu card 
utilizing bit fat file system 
microsoft also offered version standalone basic sbc intel single board computer platform 
version basic used texas instruments ti computer line 
notably written assembly language high level interpreter developed ti 
reason microsoft programmers knew code ti cpu texas instruments instead gave interpreter code instead 
unfortunate effect make ti basic extremely slow due double interpreted 
addition version included rom ti texas instruments also developed extended disk basic disk drive owners 
microsoft developed rom based basic implementation mos microprocessor began appearing microcomputers starting osi model kim
