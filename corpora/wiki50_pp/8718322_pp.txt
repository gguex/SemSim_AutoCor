this led jim magilton to label taarabt as a genius and the goal is seen as one of the championship s finest 
tottenham confirmed in october that taarabt could stay at qpr for the season providing that a premier league club did not make a bid for him in the january transfer window 
qpr were unable to make the transfer a permanent one because they could not afford the £ million valuation placed on taarabt by spurs 
in march taarabt was quoted in an interview as being sorry that he signed for tottenham 
he had said the big mistake was to sign for tottenham and not go to another club when i first came over 
he stated that he wished he had signed for arsenal instead but had opted for spurs after damien comolli moved from being a scout at arsenal to director of football at spurs 
he stated that he felt he would have been given more chances to play at arsenal and was advised at the time not to sign for spurs by his friends armand traore and abou diaby who play for arsenal 
taarabt went on to state his intention to sign for one of the top clubs in spain i hope to be playing for one of the top four in spain next season real madrid barcelona valencia or sevilla 
i have contact with good teams and i know that they want me 
now i just have to hope they can agree a deal with tottenham 
on august qpr signed taarabt to a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee 
the moroccan agreed a three year deal with the central london club 
in january taarabt was interviewed by the evening standard in which he stated the man who took me to tottenham was damien comolli 
he was at arsenal then 
but when i was going to go to arsenal he moved to tottenham 
he told me come to tottenham 
we want to do like they do at arsenal and take the best young players in the world 
you re going to have a better chance there 
i believed him 
this was a mistake and i regret it 
tottenham tried to do it like arsenal but it s a different culture 
i would have had a better chance at arsenal 
i would progress with arsène wenger 
he is a legend in france one of the best managers in the world 
adel taarabt was to make his debut as a full queens park rangers player as the club signed the moroccan for a reported £ 
the contract with queens park rangers provides for tottenham to receive of future transfer profit in addition to the payments already made 
this was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as taarabt went on to score goals in league appearances that season for the west london club 
with his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy minutes taarabt went on to win the championship player of the year award and gained a place in the championship s best xi also featuring teammate paddy kenny 
in march taarabt missed two matches when he returned to france for family matters as one of his cousins had tragically been killed by algerians 
in the international match morocco vs algeria he picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off 
in the return fixture morocco manager erik gerets decided to drop taarabt to the bench 
taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again 
however several months later taarabt wanted to play for morocco again which gerets reluctantly allowed but said that if taarabt acted irrationally again he would not play for his country whilst he was in charge 
some notable moments during the season were against cardiff city away draw where taarabt picked up a brace scoring a wonder goal in the process 
during the home game against the same opposition taarabt scored the winner which took qpr back to the top of the championship 
the season marked taarabt s first real foray into the premier league for although having been featured in english football s highest tier as a tottenham hotspur player he had never made a breakthrough into the spurs first eleven 
the start of the season held much optimism for both qpr and taarabt yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away and his name was associated with the likes of psg and napoli 
this was coupled with the arrival of joey barton in the august transfer window who was immediately installed as captain at the expense of taarabt 
these factors had the unfortunate effect of unsettling the player and he was unable to recreate his form from the previous season 
by early november he had taken over shots and none of these had resulted in a goal 
prior to this he had often let his temper get the better of him 
during the loss away to fulham on october he was substituted at half time which apparently led to an argument with manager neil warnock 
this attitude provoked criticism from his teammates with joey barton being particularly vocal 
taraabt was again substituted at half time for a poor showing in the defeat at tottenham hotspur and was subsequently left out of the side for the games against manchester city and stoke city 
during this period continued speculation linked him with psg and warnock even admitted he would gladly accept an offer for taraabt if the right offer came along 
taraabt went on international duty and also had some minor injuries which also saw him left out of the side at this stage 
warnock was highly critical of the player s agents during this period and laid much of the blame for him being unsettled at their feet 
he advised him to rethink the advice they had given him and stated they won t make him better and i think it is a shame 
adel can always make money but he is better than that 
i will be sad if he ends up going to make some money because i think he has great ability 
still left out of the side throughout most of november subsequent injuries to his teammates saw a recall however and he was commended for his performance in the loss to manchester united on december 
he sustained this level of improved performance against sunderland and swansea city 
on march taarabt scored the first goal in queens park rangers s victory over arsenal and was also voted man of the match 
taarabt followed up his goal against arsenal by scoring a long range free kick the winning goal in a victory over his former club tottenham on april 
he was also shown his first red card in english football in the same game for a second bookable offence 
on july taarabt signed a new three year contract with qpr keeping him at the club until june 
on october taarabt scored his first goal of the season against west ham united with a dipping long range shot after dribbling past two players 
he scored his second goal in three games with an emphatic volley away against west bromwich albion on october only five days later 
on december he scored both goals in qpr s first victory of the season a win over west london rivals fulham the second with a mazy dribble ending with a finish on the outside of his foot 
manager harry redknapp praised taarabt by stating it was one of the all time great performances i felt 
then on january in qpr s second win of the season a away victory over rivals chelsea taarabt was played in an unfamiliar striker position gaining the man of the match award and assisting the only goal described as pelé esque 
taarabt joined premier league side fulham on a season long loan on august 
he made his fulham debut in an away match against sunderland where he played the full minutes 
he scored his first goal for the club against burton albion in the league cup on august 
on january taarabt signed for milan until the end of the season demonstrating the rossoneri s renewed ambition on the transfer market 
he scored his first goal for ac milan minutes into his debut against napoli having tackled the ball in his own half and dribbling halfway across the pitch to score from outside the box in a loss to napoli 
on february he made his debut in the champions league in the first leg of the round of in a loss at the san siro against atlético madrid 
in the summer season taarabt returned from his loan spells back to qpr but after starting in the league cup game against burton on august only came on as a substitute in the away game against west ham 
responding to a journalist s question year old qpr manager harry redknapp stated after his team s home defeat against liverpool taarabt is not injured 
he s not fit 
he s not fit to play football unfortunately 
he played in a reserve game the other day and i could have run about more than he did 
i can t pick him 
taarabt responded that the manager is making excuses because qpr are losing games adding maybe he expects me to make more tackles 
i am not this type of player 
on june taarabt signed a five year contract with portuguese champions benfica 
on january taarabt joined italian club genoa on a loan deal 
taarabt represented france at under under and under levels but opted to play for morocco saying i felt the time was right when i was given this opportunity 
on february taarabt played his first international match with morocco in a friendly against czech republic in casablanca 
he also made an appearance on march during morocco s fifa world cup qualifier defeat against gabon 
taarabt scored his first international goal on his first start on march in a friendly victory over angola 
on september he scored his first goal in a competitive international match against togo in the world cup qualification after he broke through the opposing defence in stoppage time 
on june taarabt decided to end his international career the day after being dropped to the bench for an africa cup of nations qualifier against algeria 
he reneged on that decision returning on october for their last qualifier against tanzania 
taarabt scored a free kick that would end up being the winning goal and sealing morocco s qualification 
he made two substitute appearances in a group stage exit 
on december taarabt was left out of morocco s squad for the africa cup of nations by coach rachid taoussi 
taarabt is a muslim and stated in an interview in june that this religion has had a significant impact on his life as a footballer 
being a muslim has had a big impact on my professional life 
as muslims we don t drink alcohol we don t smoke so essentially we ve become healthier more professional footballers because of our lifestyle 
before every game i perform salat 
without it i just don t feel confident 
i make sure i pray after a match too to give thanks and be grateful for the stamina and strength god graced me with 
taarabt credits his parents with keeping his religion in his life and his father for encouraging him to play professional football 
his parents are natives of the rif region near taza
