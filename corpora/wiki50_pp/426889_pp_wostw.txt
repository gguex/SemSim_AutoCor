photometry science measurement light terms perceived brightness human eye 
distinct radiometry science measurement radiant energy including light terms absolute power 
modern photometry radiant power wavelength weighted luminosity function models human brightness sensitivity 
typically weighting function photopic sensitivity function although scotopic function functions may also applied way 
human eye equally sensitive wavelengths visible light 
photometry attempts account weighing measured power wavelength factor represents sensitive eye wavelength 
standardized model eye response light function wavelength given luminosity function 
eye different responses function wavelength adapted light conditions photopic vision dark conditions scotopic vision 
photometry typically based eye photopic response photometric measurements may accurately indicate perceived brightness sources dim lighting conditions colors discernible moonlight starlight 
photopic vision characteristic eye response luminance levels three candela per square metre 
scotopic vision occurs Ã— cd 
mesopic vision occurs limits well characterised spectral response 
measurement effects electromagnetic radiation became field study early end th century 
measurement techniques varied depending effects study gave rise different nomenclature 
total heating effect infrared radiation measured thermometers led development radiometric units terms total energy power 
use human eye detector led photometric units weighted eye response characteristic 
study chemical effects ultraviolet radiation led characterization total dose actinometric units expressed photons per second 
many different units measure used photometric measurements 
people sometimes ask need many different units ask conversions units converted lumens candelas example 
familiar idea adjective heavy refer weight density fundamentally different things 
similarly adjective bright refer light source delivers high luminous flux measured lumens light source concentrates luminous flux narrow beam candelas light source seen dark background 
ways light propagates three dimensional space spreading becoming concentrated reflecting shiny matte surfaces light consists many different wavelengths number fundamentally different kinds light measurement made large numbers quantities units represent 
example offices typically brightly illuminated array many recessed fluorescent lights combined high luminous flux 
laser pointer low luminous flux could illuminate room blindingly bright one direction high luminous intensity direction 
two parallel systems quantities known photometric radiometric quantities 
every quantity one system analogous quantity system 
examples parallel quantities include 
photometric quantities every wavelength weighted according sensitive human eye radiometric quantities use unweighted absolute power 
example eye responds much strongly green light red green source greater luminous flux red source radiant flux would 
radiant energy outside visible spectrum contribute photometric quantities example watt space heater may put great deal radiant flux watts fact light source puts lumens energy infrared leaving dim red glow visible 
watts units radiant flux lumens units luminous flux 
comparison watt lumen illustrates distinction radiometric photometric units 
watt unit power 
accustomed thinking light bulbs terms power watts 
power measure amount light output rather indicates much energy bulb use 
incandescent bulbs sold general service fairly similar characteristics spectral power distribution power consumption provides rough guide light output incandescent bulbs 
watts also direct measure output 
radiometric sense incandescent light bulb efficient energy lost e g 
conduction lamp base 
remainder emitted radiation mostly infrared 
thus watt light bulb emits total radiant flux watts 
incandescent bulbs fact sometimes used heat sources chick incubator usually used purpose providing light 
inefficient radiant energy emit invisible infrared 
compact fluorescent lamp provide light comparable watt incandescent consuming little watts electricity 
lumen photometric unit light output 
although consumers still think light terms power consumed bulb u trade requirement several decades light bulb packaging give output lumens 
package watt incandescent bulb indicates provides lumens package watt compact fluorescent 
lumen defined amount light given one steradian point source one candela strength candela base si unit defined luminous intensity source monochromatic radiation frequency terahertz radiant intensity watts per steradian 
thz corresponds nanometres wavelength green human eye sensitive 
number chosen make candela equal standard candle unit superseded 
combining definitions see watt nanometre green light provides one lumen 
relation watts lumens simple scaling factor 
know already watt incandescent bulb watt compact fluorescent provide lumens 
definition tells us watt pure green nm light worth lumens 
say anything wavelengths 
lumens photometric units relationship watts depends wavelength according visible wavelength 
infrared ultraviolet radiation example invisible count 
one watt infrared radiation radiation incandescent bulb falls worth zero lumens 
within visible spectrum wavelengths light weighted according function called photopic spectral luminous efficiency 
according function nm red light efficient nm green light 
thus one watt nm red light worth lumens 
summation visual portion em spectrum part weighting unit lumen color blind way tell color lumen appear 
equivalent evaluating groceries number bags information specific content number refers total weighted quantity 
photometric measurement based photodetectors devices several types produce electric signal exposed light 
simple applications technology include switching luminaires based ambient light conditions light meters used measure total amount light incident point 
complex forms photometric measurement used frequently within lighting industry 
spherical photometers used measure directional luminous flux produced lamps consist large diameter globe lamp mounted center 
photocell rotates lamp three axes measuring output lamp sides 
lamps lighting fixtures tested using goniophotometers rotating mirror photometers keep photocell stationary sufficient distance luminaire considered point source 
rotating mirror photometers use motorized system mirrors reflect light emanating luminaire directions distant photocell goniophotometers use rotating axis table change orientation luminaire respect photocell 
either case luminous intensity tabulated data used lighting design
