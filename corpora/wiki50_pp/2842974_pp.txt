japanese particles or are suffixes or short words in japanese grammar that immediately follow the modified noun verb adjective or sentence 
their grammatical range can indicate various meanings and functions such as speaker affect and assertiveness 
japanese particles are written in hiragana in modern japanese though some of them also have kanji forms 弖 or 天 for te て 爾 for ni に 乎 or 遠 for o を and 波 for wa は 
particles follow the same rules of phonetic transcription as all japanese words with the exception of は written ha pronounced wa as a particle へ written he pronounced e and を written using a hiragana character with no other use in modern japanese originally assigned as wo now usually pronounced o though some speakers render it as wo 
these exceptions are a relic of historical kana usage 
there are eight types of particles depending on what function they serve 
が、の、を、に、へ、と、で、から、より 
か、の、や、に、と、やら、なり、だの 
か、の、や、な、わ、とも、かしら 
さ、よ、ね 
ばかり、まで、だけ、ほど、くらい、など、なり、やら 
は、も、こそ、でも、しか、さえ、だに 
ば、や、が、て、のに、ので、から、ところが、けれども 
の、から 
note that some particles appear in two types 
for example kara is a case marker where it describes where something is from or what happens after something when it describes a cause it is a conjunctive particle 
ni and de can both be used to show location corresponding to the prepositions in or at in english 
their uses are mutually exclusive 
ni when used to show location is used only with stative verbs such as iru to be exist aru to be exist have and sumu to live inhabit 
de is used with action verbs to convey the place of action as opposed to location of being 
ni and e can both indicate direction of motion meaning to or at in english 
in this sense e is perhaps closer to english towards in terms of use see example below 
as long as ni is used directionally it is possible to substitute e in its place 
ni used in other senses can not be replaced by e 
indicating direction using e instead of ni is preferred when ni is used non directionally in proximity 
in some cases ga and o are interchangeable 
for example with the tai form meaning want to it is possible to say either of the following 
similarly 好き suki a na adjective meaning liked can take either ga or o 
ni and to are sometimes interchangeable in forms like になる ni naru and となる to naru 
the ni naru form suggests a natural change whereas to naru suggests change to a final stage 
い i was used in old japanese and kanbun works 
its meaning is still debated but has traditionally been considered emphatic 
many japanese particles fill the role of prepositions in english but they are unlike prepositions in many ways 
japanese does not have equivalents of prepositions like on and often uses particles along with verbs and nouns to modify another word where english might use prepositions 
for example ue is a noun meaning top up and ni tsuite is a fixed verbal expression meaning concerning and when used as postpositions
