upon arrival he discovers his father was not alone in the fiat he was driving with him was his british mistress whose daughter free spirited london shop girl pamela piggott also is on the scene though she clearly knew of their parents clandestine romance beforehand

complications arise when the bodies disappear from the morgue 
wendell suspects pamela who has expressed a wish that they be buried in ischia however it is revealed that the actual bodysnatchers are the trotta family whose vineyard was damaged when the elder armbruster s car drove into it during the fatal automobile accident

wendell and pamela part with a vow to return next year just as their parents did 
although samuel taylor s play had closed on broadway after only twenty one performances in early talent agent charles feldman who previously had interested billy wilder in filming the seven year itch had purchased the screen rights and offered the property to wilder 
the director had begun working on the private life of sherlock holmes and it wasn t until that project was completed that he was able to concentrate on avanti 
when longtime screenwriting partner i a l 
diamond proved to be unavailable wilder collaborated first with julius j epstein and then norman krasna but he was unhappy with the results 
then diamond became free and with the ultimately uncredited assistance of luciano vincenzoni he and wilder began adapting the taylor play 
wilder was determined to create a bittersweet love story a little like brief encounter which i always admired he later recalled 
early in the writing period wilder showed jack lemmon some of the completed script and he agreed to play wendell armbruster jr knowing pretty early on jack was going to be in our film made it more comfortable writing his dialogue said diamond who preferred to tailor a screenplay to a specific actor 
wilder was familiar with juliet mills from the television sitcom nanny and the professor and while he was unimpressed with the series he thought she was a good actress with a lot of appeal so he offered her the role of pamela piggott 
i loved billy wilder just calling me and asking me to be in his film the actress recalled no lawyer or agent his voice not asking for an audition or a screen test 
wilder told her the role required her to gain twenty five pounds and mills readily agreed 
she also agreed to a nude scene although diamond was opposed to including one in the film 
i think nudity hurts laughs he stated 
i mean if you re watching somebody s boobs you re not listening to the dialogue 
after viewing a number of italian films wilder selected luigi kuveiller as his cinematographer based on his work on the elio petri film a quiet place in the country 
the story of avanti is set on the island of ischia where some of the exterior scenes were shot including a brief scene outside the morgue the interior of which as with all the interior sets was designed by italian production designer fernando scarfiotti at and around the port of ischia where lemmon and mills arrive on the island and on a small rock jutting out of the water just off the shore of ischia where mills nude scene takes place 
but most of the exteriors were shot in sorrento including the exterior of lemmon s hotel on capri notably the hilltop heliport overlooking the tyrrhenian sea and along the amalfi coast and interiors were filmed on scarfiotti s sets including the interior lobby and rooms of lemmon s hotel at the safa palatino studios in rome following location shooting during the summer of 
principal photography was completed on schedule and under budget 
wilder was disappointed with the completed film 
maybe we went overboard with some of the comic relief because avanti 
is not a comedy he stated 
if this film had worked the way we wanted it to it would have had more of the quality of the apartment 
i always feel sorry for the disappointment of the actors and all those dear technical people who do so much when the picture doesn t make it the way they hoped 
i went much farther with forbidden themes than i had with kiss me stupid but nobody cared 
audiences thought it was too long and too bland 
i guess they would have liked it better if it turned out the father was having the affair with one of the bellboys at the hotel 
a h weiler of the new york times thought the film was intermittently funny charming cute and unfortunately over long 
he continued wilder lemmon and i a l 
fitfully charm us but they haven t moved forward at any great comic clip 
they have warped some parts of the playwright s plot to give us a fairly reasonable flow of giggles and an occasional guffaw 
he also cited a fine job turned in by clive revill 
roger ebert of the chicago sun times called the film a pleasant civilized comedy and added avanti 
isn t a laugh a minute kind of a movie and it s too long by maybe half an hour 
it also suffers from the problem that the audience has everything figured out several minutes before jack lemmon does 
still the movie has a certain charm some of which seeps in along with the locations and there is in most of the many wilder lemmon collaborations a cheerful insouciance as if life is best approached with a cheerful if puzzled grin 
jay cocks of time observed the topical dialogue by wilder and i a l 
diamond kissinger jokes billy graham jokes etc 
gives this passingly pleasant movie the sound of a bob hope tv special 
but miss mills is fresh and winning and there is a deft performance by clive revill 
the british television network channel has called the film a rare instance of the travel comedy never an easy thing to pull off succeeding without recourse to old racial stereotypes 
as a love story it s full of wilder s biting satire 
taken at face value it s simply a travel comedy about funny foreigners and love in the mediterranean 
yet what stands out is how uncomfortable wilder seems to be with making a sex comedy in the s 
forced to take on board the aftershocks of the summer of love but saddled with an old man s attitude and an old man s cast wilder seems perilously out of his depth 
as lemmon and mills strip off to reveal pale white skin and flabby fat you can t help feeling that the resolutely misanthropic director is somewhat appalled by the realities of his characters bedroom antics 
jack lemmon won the golden globe award for best actor motion picture musical or comedy and nominations went to billy wilder for best director wilder and i a l 
diamond for best screenplay juliet mills for best actress clive revill for best supporting actor and the film itself for best motion picture musical or comedy
