wtte channel is a fox affiliated television station located in columbus ohio usa 
wtte s broadcast license is owned by cunningham broadcasting while the station s operations are controlled via local marketing agreement lma by the sinclair broadcast group wtte s original owners and present proprietors of abc affiliate wsyx channel 
sinclar broadcast group also operates chillicothe licensed cw affiliated wwho channel through a shared services agreement with manhan media 
the three stations share studios on dublin road in grandview heights a suburb of columbus wtte and wsyx also share a transmitter on columbus west side 
wtte began operations on june as the first general entertainment independent station in central ohio 
the station was founded by the commercial radio institute a subsidiary of the baltimore based sinclair broadcast group 
wtte quickly became the dominant independent station in the area largely because its programming policy was far less conservative than that of the other independent in the area christian oriented newark licensed wsfj tv channel 
channel is a charter affiliate of fox having joined the network at its launch on october 
from until it carried a secondary affiliation with upn which was then picked up by wwho 
in sinclair merged with river city broadcasting owner of wsyx 
federal communications commission fcc rules at the time did not allow one person to own two stations in a single market 
sinclair kept the longer established wsyx and nominally sold wtte to glencairn ltd owned by former sinclair executive edwin edwards 
however nearly all of glencairn s stock was held by the smith family founders and owners of sinclair 
in effect sinclair still owned wtte and now had a duopoly in columbus in violation of fcc rules 
sinclair and glencairn further circumvented the rules by moving wtte s operations into wsyx studios under a local marketing agreement with wsyx as senior partner 
glencairn owned ten other stations all in markets where sinclair also had a station 
sinclair was eventually fined for its illegal control of glencairn 
the two companies attempted to merge in after the fcc allowed duopolies 
however the fcc would not allow sinclair to repurchase wtte 
the fcc does not allow duopolies between two of the four highest rated stations in a single market 
also the columbus market despite its relatively large size has only seven full power stations too few to legally permit a duopoly 
wtte thus remained under the banner of glencairn which was then renamed cunningham broadcasting 
however the smith family still controls nearly all of cunningham s stock so sinclair still effectively has a duopoly in columbus 
by nearly all accounts sinclair has used glencairn cunningham as a shell corporation to evade fcc ownership rules 
in all sinclair controlled fox affiliates including wtte extended their affiliation contracts until at least march 
wtte dt was formerly an affiliate of the tube a hour digital music channel 
like other sinclair owned stations this was dropped in january due to a disagreement between sinclair and the tube over e i programming 
the network ceased operations that october due to the lack of advertising 
according to nielsen media research in the may ratings period wtte was the nd most watched fox affiliate in the united states in prime time 
the station remains intensely competitive in the columbus television market with it remaining an extremely strong competitor against wbns tv and wcmh tv averaging roughly viewers each night during the station s o clock newscast despite its earlier time slot 
wtte typically wins the demographic viewership battle each and every ratings period 
the demographic win is a much sought after attribute for television sales associates in the area for local advertising purposes 
on october the station reactivated their digital subchannel for the first time since december with thecooltv a music video network which unlike the tube had e i programming pre inserted as part of their national schedule 
the network was discontinued as of august 
wtte is also considered an alternate abc affiliate airing that network s programs when wsyx is unable to do so such as during a breaking news emergency or local special 
on may sinclair and fox agreed to a five year extension to the network s affiliation agreement with the fox stations owned or controlled by sinclair including wtte allowing them to continue carrying the network s programming through 
on june sinclair signed a deal with sony pictures entertainment to carry the gettv network as a subchannel on of their stations wtte was one such station and the subchannel was reactivated 
on june sinclair replaced gettv with tbd tv network on wtte s subchannel 
tbd is operated by sinclair television group a subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group 
wtte was one of only two full power television stations in the columbus market the other being wwho that honored the original dtv transition date of february 
the station shut down its analog signal over uhf channel at p m on that date as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television 
the station s digital signal remained on its pre transition uhf channel using psip to display wtte s virtual channel as on digital television receivers 
however until march as part of the safer act analog channel aired a repeating loop of a short informational film in both english and spanish about the dtv changeover and how to upgrade to digital television 
analog channel has since gone dark
