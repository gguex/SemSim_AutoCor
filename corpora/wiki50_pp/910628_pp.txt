as the election approaches roberts is asked to appear on a network s sketch comedy show 
when roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show 
this new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid performance

the film s style is drawn from a number of real and mock documentaries and its shots are crafted to create this effect in many cases through the use of hand held cameras 
not only does roberts character draw from s era iconography of bob dylan it also contains scenes inspired by the documentary dont look back made about the singer employing a similar although consciously constructed cinema verit√© style 
the film also draws from rob reiner s mockumentary this is spinal tap which robbins states is one of his favorite films and directly references this during the scene in which roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance 
in the case of gore vidal s character the majority of the lines were not scripted and instead vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs and his real life positions on many of the fictional election topics 
while critics and audiences have responded to this film by connecting roberts character to various political figures such as george h w bush and pennsylvania senator rick santorum robbins has said that the film related more to the political system in general than any specific politician 
much of robbins commentary is addressed at the role of the media in election campaigns 
some have critiqued robbins for his approach toward political satire stating that his references to reagan era politics and the rebelliousness of the s are simply too anachronistic in the context of the s but others have praised it for framing political commentary as a hollywood comedy
