this article pertains to the chemical element for other uses see argon disambiguation argon is a chemical element designated by the symbol ar argon has atomic number 18 and is the third element in group 18 of the periodic table noble gases argon is present in the earths atmosphere at slightly less than 1 making it the most common noble gas on earth its full outer shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements its triple point temperature of 838058 k is a defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of 1990
argon has approximately the same solubility in water as oxygen gas and is 25 times more soluble in water than nitrogen gas this highly stable chemical element is colorless odorless tasteless and nontoxic in both its liquid and gaseous forms argon is inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature
although argon is a noble gas it has been found to have the capability of forming some compounds for example the creation of argon hydrofluoride harf a metastable compound of argon with fluorine and hydrogen has been reported by researchers at the university of helsinki in 2000 although the neutral groundstate chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to harf argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules also argoncontaining ions eg arh and excited state complexes eg arf are well known theoretical calculations on computers have shown several argon compounds that should be stable but for which no synthesis routes are currently known
argon greek αργόν meaning the lazy one in reference to its chemical inactivity was suspected to be present in air by henry cavendish in 1785 but was not discovered until 1894 by lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay in an experiment in which they removed all of the oxygen and nitrogen from a sample of air argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of hf newall and wn hartley each observed new lines in the color spectrum of air but were unable to identify the element responsible for the lines argon became the first member of the noble gases to be discovered the symbol for argon is now ar but up until 1957 it was a
there are several different reasons why argon is used in particular applications an inert gas is needed in particular argon is the cheapest alternative when diatomic nitrogen is not sufficiently inert low thermal conductivity is required the electronic properties ionization andor the emission spectrum are necessary
other noble gases would probably work as well in most of these applications but argon is by far the cheapest argon is inexpensive since it is a byproduct of the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen both of which are used on a large industrial scale the other noble gases except helium are produced this way as well but argon is the most plentiful since it has the highest concentration in the atmosphere the bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap argon is used as a fill gas in incandescent lighting because argon will not react with the filament of light bulbs even at high temperatures as an inert gas shield in many forms of welding including metal inert gas welding and tungsten inert gas welding for extinguishing fires where damage to equipment is to be avoided see photo as the gas of choice for the plasma used in icp spectroscopy as a nonreactive blanket in the processing of titanium and other reactive elements as a protective atmosphere for growing silicon and germanium crystals and in partial pressure heat treat furnaces by museum conservators to protect old materials or documents which are prone to gradual oxidation in the presence of air to keep open bottles of wine from oxidizing and in a number of dispensing units and keeper cap systems in winemaking to top off barrels displacing oxygen and thus preventing the wine from turning to vinegar during the aging process in the pharmaceutical industry to top off bottles of intravenous drug preparations for example intravenous paracetamol again displacing oxygen and therefore prolonging the drugs shelflife used to cool the seeker head of the us air force version of the aim9 sidewinder missile the gas is stored at high pressure and the expansion of the gas cools the seeker
the next most common reason for using argon is its low thermal conductivity it is used for thermal insulation in energy efficient windows argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity
argon is also used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light it is used in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries destroy tumors and to correct eye defects in microelectronics argon ions are used for sputtering
finally there are a number of miscellaneous uses argon39 with a half life of 269 years has been used for a number of applications primarily ice core and ground water dating the argon40 potassium 40 ratio is used in dating igneous rocks
cryosurgery procedures such as cryoablation use liquified argon to destroy cancer cells in surgery it is used in a procedure called argon enhanced coagulation which is a form of argon plasma beam electrosurgery the procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism in the patient and has resulted in the death of one person via this type of accident
argon constitutes 0934 by volume and 129 by mass of the earths atmosphere and air is the primary raw material used by industry to produce purified argon products argon is isolated from air by fractionation most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation a process that also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton and xenon

argons complete octet of electrons indicates full s and p subshells this full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements before 1962 argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds however compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized in august 2000 the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the university of helsinki by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride argon hydrofluoride harf was formed it is stable up to 40 kelvins 233nbsp c
the discovery of argon difluoride arf2 was announced in 2003 but this is unconfirmed and most probably incorrect
the main isotopes of argon found on earth are 40ar 996 36ar 034 and 38ar 006 naturally occurring 40 k with a halflife of 125 years decays to stable 40ar 112 by electron capture and positron emission and also to stable 40ca 888 via beta decay these properties and ratios are used to determine the age of rocks
in the earths atmosphere 39ar is made by cosmic ray activity primarily with 40ar in the subsurface environment it is also produced through neutron capture by 39k or alpha emission by calcium 37ar is created from the decay of 40ca as a result of subsurface nuclear explosions it has a halflife of 35 days

the egyptians called antimony mśdmt in hieroglyphics the vowels are uncertain but there is an arabic tradition that the word is mesdemet the greek word stimmi is probably a loan word from arabic or egyptian and is used by the attic tragic poets of the 5th century bc later greeks also used stibi as did celsus and pliny writing in latin in the first century ad pliny also gives the names stimi sic larbaris alabaster and the very common platyophthalmos wideeye from the effect of the cosmetic later latin authors adapted the word to latin as stibium the arabic word for the substance as opposed to the cosmetic can appear as ithmid athmoud othmod or uthmod littré suggests the first form which is the earliest derives from stimmida one accusative for stimmi
the use of sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to the 18th century chemical pioneer jöns jakob berzelius who used this abbreviation of the name stibium
the medieval latin form from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names is antimonium the origin of this is uncertain all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation the popular etymology from antimonachos or french antimoine still has adherents this would mean monkkiller and is explained by many early alchemists being monks and antimony being poisonous so does the hypothetical greek word antimonos against one explained as not found as metal or not found unalloyed lippmann conjectured a greek word anthemonion which would mean floret and he cites several examples of related greek words but not that one which describe chemical or biological efflorescence
the early uses of antimonium include the translations in 10501100 by constantine the african of arabic medical treatises several authorities believe that antimonium is a scribal corruption of some arabic form meyerhof derives it from ithmid other possibilities include athimar the arabic name of the metal and a hypothetical asstimmi derived from or parallel to the greek

actinium is a silvery radioactive metallic element due to its intense radioactivity actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light it is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227ac an α and β emitter with a halflife of 21773 years one ton of uranium ore contains about a tenth of a gram of actinium
it is about 150 times as radioactive as radium making it valuable as a neutron source otherwise it has no significant industrial applications
225ac is used in medicine to produce 213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radioimmunotherapy for targeted alpha therapy tat 225ac was first produced artificially by the itu in germany using a cyclotron and by dr graeme melville at st george hospital in sydney using a linac in 2000
actinium was discovered in 1899 by andrélouis debierne a french chemist who separated it from pitchblende friedrich oskar giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 and called it emanium in 1904 debiernes name was retained because it had seniority the chemical behavior of actinium is similar to that of the rare earth lanthanum
the word actinium comes from the greek aktis aktinos meaning beam or ray
actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300ºc
naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive isotope 227ac 36 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 227ac with a halflife of 21772 y 225ac with a halflife of 100 days and 226ac with a halflife of 2937 h all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflifes that are less than 10 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute the shortestlived isotope of actinium is 217ac which decays through alpha decay and electron capture it has a halflife of 69 ns actinium also has 2 meta states
purified 227ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days and then decays according to its 21773year halflife
the isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206 u 206ac to 236 u 236ac
227ac is extremely radioactive and in terms of its potential for radiation induced health effects 227ac is even more dangerous than plutonium ingesting even small amounts of 227ac would be fatal

pure americium has a silvery and white lustre at room temperatures it slowly tarnishes in dry air it is more silvery than plutonium or neptunium and apparently more malleable than neptunium or uranium alpha emission from 241am is approximately three times that of radium gram quantities of 241am emit intense gamma rays which creates a serious exposure problem for anyone handling the element
americium is also fissile the critical mass for an unreflected sphere of 241am is approximately 60 kilograms it is unlikely that americium would be used as a weapons material as its minimum critical mass is considerably larger than more readily obtained plutonium or uranium isotopes
this element can be produced in kilogram amounts and has some uses mostly 241am since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope americium has found its way into the household where one type of smoke detector contains a tiny amount about 02 microgram of 241am as a source of ionizing radiation 241am has been used as a portable gamma ray source for use in radiography the element has also been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass 242am is a neutron emitter and has found uses in neutron radiography it has also been cited for use as an advanced nuclear rocket propulsion fuel this isotope is however extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities
americium was first isolated by glenn t seaborg leon o morgan ralph a james and albert ghiorso in late 1944 at the wartime metallurgical laboratory at the university of chicago now known as argonne national laboratory the team created the isotope 241am by subjecting 239 pu to successive neutron capture reactions in a nuclear reactor this created 240pu and then 241pu which in turn decayed into 241am via beta decay seaborg was granted a patent for element 95 and method of producing said element whose unusually terse claim number 1 reads simply element 95 the discovery of americium and curium was first announced informally on a childrens quiz show in 1945
18 radioisotopes of americium have been characterized with the most stable being 243am with a halflife of 7370 years and 241am with a halflife of 4322 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 51 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 100 minutes this element also has 8 meta states with the most stable being 242mam t 141 years the isotopes of americium range in atomic weight from 231046 u 231am to 249078 u 249am
in aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is 3 it is very much harder to oxidize amiii to amiv than it is to oxidise puiii to puiv
currently the solvent extraction chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world scientists are working on reducing the medium term radiotoxicity of the waste from the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel
see liquidliquid extraction for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium
americium dioxide is used in smoke detectors
americium unlike uranium does not readily form a dioxide americyl core amo2 this is because americium is very hard to oxidise above the 3 oxidation state when it is in an aqueous solution in the environment this americyl core could complex with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties oh no2 no3 and so42 to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil
amo2oh1 amo2oh22 amo2co31 amo2co321 amo2co333
a large amount of work has been done on the solvent extraction of americium as it is the case that americium and the other transplutonium elements are responsible for the majority of the long lived radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel it is thought that by removal of the americium and curium that the used fuel will only need to be isolated from man and his environment for a shorter time than that required for the isolation of untreated used fuel one recent eu funded project on this topic was known by the codename europart within this project triazines and other compounds were studied as potential extraction agents

this highly radioactive element has been confirmed by mass spectrometers to behave chemically much like other halogens especially iodine it would probably accumulate in the thyroid gland like iodine though astatine is thought to be more metallic than iodine researchers at the brookhaven national laboratory have performed experiments that have identified and measured elementary reactions that involve astatine however chemical research into astatine is limited by its extreme rarity which is a consequence of its extremely short halflife its most stable isotope has a halflife of around 83 hours the final product of the decay of astatine is an isotope of lead
astatine is the rarest naturallyoccurring element with the total amount in earths crust estimated to be less than 1 oz 28 g at any given time this amounts to less than one teaspoon of the element guinness world records has dubbed the element the rarest on earth stating only around 09 oz 25 g of the element astatine at occurring naturally isaac asimov in a 1957 essay on large numbers scientific notation and the size of the atom wrote that in all of north and south america to a depth of ten miles the number of astatine atoms at any time was only a trillion
the existence of ekaiodine had been predicted by mendeleev astatine after greek αστατος astatos meaning unstable was first synthesized in 1940 by dale r corson k r mackenzie and emilio segrè at the university of california berkeley by barraging bismuth with alpha particles an earlier name for the element was alabamine ab
astatine is produced by bombarding bismuth with energetic alpha particles to obtain relatively longlived 209at 211at which can then be distilled from the target by heating in the presence of air
multiple compounds of astatine have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their inevitable radioactive disintegration while these compounds are primarily of theoretical interest they are being studied for potential use in nuclear medicine
astatine has 33 known isotopes all of which are radioactive the range of their mass numbers is from 191 to 223 there exist also 23 metastable excited states the longestlived isotope is 210at which has a halflife of 83 hours the shortestlived known isotope is 213at which has a halflife of 125 nanoseconds
los alamos national laboratory astatine webelementscom astatine aluminium or aluminum see spelling below is a silvery white and ductile member of the poor metal group of chemical elements it has the symbol al its atomic number is 13 aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth s crust and the third most abundant element overall after oxygen and silicon it makes up about 8 by weight of the earths solid surface aluminium is too reactive chemically to occur in nature as the free metal instead it is found combined in over 270 different minerals the chief source of aluminium is bauxite ore aluminium is remarkable for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation and its light weight structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and very important in other areas of transportation and building
ancient greeks and romans used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds alum is still used as a styptic in 1761 guyton de morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine in 1808 humphry davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum which he at first termed alumium and later aluminum see etymology section below
friedrich wöhler is generally credited with isolating aluminium latin alumen alum in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium the metal was however produced for the first time two years earlier in an impure form by the danish physicist and chemist hans christian ørsted therefore ørsted can also be listed as the discoverer of the metal further pierre berthier discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it the frenchman henri etienne sainteclaire deville improved wöhlers method in 1846 and described his improvements in a book in 1859 chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium
note the title of devilles book is de laluminium ses propriétés sa fabrication paris 1859 it was rather likely that deville also conceived the idea of the electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite however charles martin hall and paul héroult might have developed the more practical process after deville
before the hallhéroult process was developed aluminium was initially found to be exceedingly difficult to extract from its various ores this made pure aluminium more valuable than gold bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the french crown jewels at the exposition universelle of 1855 and napoleon iii was said to have reserved a set of aluminium dinner plates for his most honored guests
aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the washington monument in 1884 a time when one ounce 30 grams cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project aluminium was about the same value as silver
the cowles companies supplied aluminium alloy in quantity in the united states and england using smelters like the furnace of carl wilhelm siemens by 1886 charles martin hall of ohio in the us and paul héroult of france independently developed the hallhéroult electrolytic process that made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper and is now the principal method used worldwide the hallheroult process cannot produce super purity aluminium directly halls process in 1888 with the financial backing of alfred e hunt started the pittsburgh reduction company today known as alcoa héroults process was in production by 1889 in switzerland at aluminium industrie now alcan and at british aluminium now luxfer group and alcoa by 1896 in scotland
by 1895 the metal was being used as a building material as far away as sydney australia in the dome of the chief secretarys building
in november 2007 the price of aluminium on nymex was around 110 or 120 a pound
the earliest citation given in the oxford english dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium which humphry davy employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral alumina the citation is from his journal philosophical transactions had i been so fortunate asto have procured the metallic substances i was in search of i should have proposed for them the names of silicium alumium zirconium and glucium
by 1812 davy had settled on aluminum which as other sources note matches its latin root he wrote in the journal chemical philosophy as yet aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state but the same year an anonymous contributor to the quarterly review a british politicalliterary journal objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has a less classical sound
the ium suffix had the advantage of conforming to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which davy had isolated himself nevertheless um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time as for example platinum known to europeans since the sixteenth century molybdenum discovered in 1778 and tantalum discovered in 1802
americans adopted ium to fit the standard form of the periodic table of elements for most of the nineteenth century with aluminium appearing in websters dictionary of 1828 in 1892 however charles martin hall used the um spelling in an advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the ium spelling in all the patents it has consequently been suggested that the spelling reflects an easier to pronounce word with one fewer syllable or that the spelling on the flier was a spelling mistake halls domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling aluminum became the standard in north america the webster unabridged dictionary of 1913 though continued to use the ium version
in 1926 the american chemical society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications american dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as a british variant
in the uk and other countries using british spelling only aluminium is used in the united states the spelling aluminium is largely unknown and the spelling aluminum predominates the canadian oxford dictionary prefers aluminum whereas the australian macquarie dictionary prefers aluminium the spelling in virtually all other languages is analogous to the ium ending
the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but three years later recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant hence their periodic table includes both but places aluminium first iupac officially prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications although several iupac publications use the spelling aluminum
aluminium has nine isotopes whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30 only 27al stable isotope and 26al radioactive isotope tsub12sub 72 105 y occur naturally however 27al has a natural abundance of 999 26al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmicray protons aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating marine sediments manganese nodules glacial ice quartz in rock exposures and meteorites the ratio of 26al to 10 be has been used to study the role of transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion on 105 to 106 year time scales cosmogenic 26al was first applied in studies of the moon and meteorites meteorite fragments after departure from their parent bodies are exposed to intense cosmicray bombardment during their travel through space causing substantial 26al production after falling to earth atmospheric shielding protects the meteorite fragments from further 26al production and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorites terrestrial age meteorite research has also shown that 26al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system most meteoriticists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 455 billion years ago
aluminium is a soft lightweight malleable metal with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray depending on the surface roughness aluminium is nontoxic aluminium is a neurotoxin nonmagnetic and nonsparking the yield strength of pure aluminium is 711 mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 mpa to 600 mpa aluminium has about onethird the density and stiffness of steel it is ductile and easily machined cast and extruded
corrosion resistance is excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper
aluminium atoms are arranged in an fcc structure aluminium has a high stackingfault energy of approximately 200 mjm
aluminium is one of the few metals that retain full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver paints aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200400 nm uv and the 300010000 nm far ir regions while in the 400700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by silver and in the 7003000 near ir by silver gold and copper
aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor by weight better than copper aluminium is capable of being a superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 12 kelvins
although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the earths crust believed to be 75 to 81 percent it is rare in its free form occurring in oxygendeficient environments such as volcanic mud and it was once considered a precious metal more valuable than gold napoleon iii emperor of the french is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils while the other guests had to make do with gold ones aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years
aluminium is a reactive metal that is difficult to extract from ore aluminium oxide al2o3 for example direct reduction with carbon is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2000 c therefore it is extracted by electrolysis that is the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal by this process the operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980 c cryolite is found as a mineral in greenland but in industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance cryolite is a mixture of aluminium sodium and calcium fluorides na3alf6 the aluminium oxide a white powder is obtained by refining bauxite in the bayer process of karl bayer previously the deville process was the predominant refining technology
the electrolytic process replaced the wöhler process which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium both of the electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon once the ore is in the molten state its ions are free to move around the reaction at the cathode the negative terminal is al3 3 e al
here the aluminium ion is being reduced electrons are added the aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off
at the positive electrode anode oxygen is formed 2 o2 o2 4 e
this carbon anode is then oxidized by the oxygen releasing carbon dioxide the anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly since they are consumed in the process o2 c co2
unlike the anodes the cathodes are not oxidised because there is no oxygen present at the cathode the carbon cathode is protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells nevertheless cathodes do erode mainly due to electrochemical processes after five to ten years depending on the current used in the electrolysis a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear
aluminium electrolysis with the hallhéroult process consumes a lot of energy but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically andor ecologically the worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 1505 kilowatthours per kilogram of aluminium produced from alumina 52 to 56 mj kg the most modern smelters reach approximately 128 kwhkg 461 mjkg compare this to the heat of reaction 31 mjkg and the gibbs free energy of reaction 29 mjkg reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 ka stateoftheart smelters operate with about 350 ka trials have been reported with 500 ka cells
recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important facet of the aluminium industry recycling involves melting the scrap a process that uses only five percent of the energy needed to produce aluminium from ore however a significant part up to 15 of input material is lost as dross ashlike oxide recycling was a lowprofile activity until the late 1960s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to the public consciousness
electric power represents about 20 to 40 of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive such as south africa the south island of new zealand australia the peoples republic of china the middle east russia quebec and british columbia in canada and iceland in 2005 the peoples republic of china was the top producer of aluminium with almost onefifth world share followed by russia canada and usa reports the british geological survey
over the last 50 years australia has become a major producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina australia produced 62 million tonnes of bauxite in 2005 the australian deposits have some refining problems some being high in silica but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine
alh is produced when aluminium is heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen al2o is made by heating the normal oxide al2o3 with silicon at 1800 c in a vacuum al2s can be made by heating al2s3 with aluminium shavings at 1300 c in a vacuum it quickly disproportionates to the starting materials the selenide is made in a parallel manner alf alcl and albr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium aluminium halides usually exist in the form alx3 eg alf3 alcl3 albr3 ali3 etc
aluminium monoxide alo is present when aluminium powder burns in oxygen
fajans rules show that the simple trivalent cation al3 is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as al2o3 the hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak acids such as carbonate cant be prepared the salts of strong acids such as nitrate are stable and soluble in water forming hydrates with at least six molecules of water of crystallization aluminium hydride alh3n can be produced from trimethylaluminium and an excess of hydrogen it burns explosively in air it can also be prepared by the action of aluminium chloride on lithium hydride in ether solution but cannot be isolated free from the solvent aluminium carbide al4c3 is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1000 c the pale yellow crystals have a complex lattice structure and react with water or dilute acids to give methane the acetylide al2c23 is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium aluminium nitride aln can be made from the elements at 800 c it is hydrolysed by water to form ammonia and aluminium hydroxide aluminium phosphide alp is made similarly and hydrolyses to give phosphine aluminium oxide al2o3 occurs naturally as corundum and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide nitrate or sulfate as a gemstone its hardness is only exceeded by diamond boron nitride and carborundum it is almost insoluble in water aluminium hydroxide may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt it is amphoteric being both a very weak acid and forming aluminates with alkalis it exists in various crystalline forms aluminium sulfide al2s3 may be prepared by passing hydrogen sulfide over aluminium powder it is polymorphic aluminium iodide ali32 is a dimer with applications in organic synthesis aluminium fluoride alf3 is made by treating the hydroxide with hf or can be made from the elements it consists of a giant molecule which sublimes without melting at 1291 c it is very inert the other trihalides are dimeric having a bridgelike structure aluminium fluoridewater complexes when aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as alfh2o52 alf3h2o30 alf63 of these alf63 is the most stable this is explained by the fact that aluminium and fluoride which are both very compact ions fit together just right to form the octahedral aluminium hexafluoride complex when aluminium and fluoride are together in water in a 16 molar ratio alf63 is the most common form even in rather low concentrations organometallic compounds of empirical formula alr3 exist and if not also giant molecules are at least dimers or trimers they have some uses in organic synthesis for instance trimethylaluminium aluminohydrides of the most electropositive elements are known the most useful being lithium aluminium hydride li alh4 it decomposes into lithium hydride aluminium and hydrogen when heated and is hydrolysed by water it has many uses in organic chemistry particularly as a reducing agent the aluminohalides have a similar structure
in the journal science of 14 january 2005 it was reported that clusters of 13 aluminium atoms al13 had been made to behave like an iodine atom and 14 aluminium atoms al14 behaved like an alkaline earth atom the researchers also bound 12 iodine atoms to an al13 cluster to form a new class of polyiodide this discovery is reported to give rise to the possibility of a new characterisation of the periodic table superatoms the research teams were led by shiv n khanna virginia commonwealth university and a welford castleman jr penn state university
aluminium is the most widely used nonferrous metal global production of aluminium in 2005 was 319 million tonnes it exceeded that of any other metal except iron 8375 million tonnes relatively pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance andor workability is more important than strength or hardness a thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by physical vapor deposition or very infrequently chemical vapor deposition or other chemical means to form optical coatings and mirrors when so deposited a fresh pure aluminium film serves as a good reflector approximately 92 of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as 98 of medium and far infrared
pure aluminium has a low tensile strength but when combined with thermomechanical processing aluminium alloys display a marked improvement in mechanical properties especially when tempered aluminium alloys form vital components of aircraft and rockets as a result of their high strengthtoweight ratio aluminium readily forms alloys with many elements such as copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon eg duralumin today almost all bulk metal materials that are referred to loosely as aluminium are actually alloys for example the common aluminium foils are alloys of 92 to 99 aluminium
some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in transportation automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles etc packaging cans foil etc water treatment treatment against fish parasites such as gyrodactylus salaris construction windows doors siding building wire etc cooking utensils electrical transmission lines for power distribution mkm steel and alnico magnets super purity aluminium spa 99980 to 99999 al used in electronics and cds heat sinks for electronic appliances such as transistors and cpus powdered aluminium is used in paint and in pyrotechnics such as solid rocket fuels and thermite in the blades of prop swords and knives used in stage combat

aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures alloy systems are classified by a number system ansi or by names indicating their main alloying constituents din and iso
the strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes a lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation see main article
one important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength unlike steels aluminium alloys have no welldefined fatigue limit meaning that fatigue failure will eventually occur under even very small cyclic loadings this implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a fixed life rather than an infinite life
another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium unlike steel will melt without first glowing red forming operations where a blow torch is used therefore requires some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting aluminium alloys like all structural alloys also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting the problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low melting point which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heattreating the parts in an oven followed by gradual cooling in effect annealing the stresses
the low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500nbspk the agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle including the thermally critical throat region
aluminium has about 65 of the conductivity of copper the traditional household wiring material in the 1960s aluminium was considerably cheaper than copper and so was introduced for household electrical wiring in the united states even though many fixtures had not been designed to accept aluminium wire however in some cases the greater coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminium causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal screw connection eventually loosening the connection also pure aluminium has a tendency to creep under steady sustained pressure to a greater degree as the temperature rises again loosening the connection finally galvanic corrosion from the dissimilar metals increased the electrical resistance of the connection
all of this resulted in overheated and loose connections and this in turn resulted in fires builders then became wary of using the wire and many jurisdictions outlawed its use in very small sizes in new construction eventually newer fixtures were introduced with connections designed to avoid loosening and overheating at first they were marked alcu but they now bear a coalr coding in older assemblies workers forestall the heating problem using a properlydone crimp of the aluminium wire to a short pigtail of copper wire today new alloys designs and methods are used for aluminium wiring in combination with aluminium terminations
aluminium is a neurotoxin that alters the function of the bloodbrain barrier it is one of the few abundant elements that appear to have no beneficial function to living cells a small percentage of people are allergic to it mdash they experience contact dermatitis from any form of it an itchy rash from using styptic or antiperspirant products digestive disorders and inability to absorb nutrients from eating food cooked in aluminium pans and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning from ingesting such products as amphojel and maalox antacids in other people aluminium is not considered as toxic as heavy metals but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts the use of aluminium cookware popular because of its corrosion resistance and good heat conduction has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminiumcontaining antiperspirants are more likely causes of toxicity aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory these salts estrogenlike effects have led to their classification as a metalloestrogen
it has been suggested that aluminium is a cause of alzheimers disease as some brain plaques have been found to contain the metal research in this area has been inconclusive aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the alzheimers damage not the cause in any event if there is any toxicity of aluminium it must be via a very specific mechanism since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime
mercury applied to the surface of an aluminium alloy can damage the protective oxide surface film by forming amalgam this may cause further corrosion and weakening of the structure for this reason mercury thermometers are not allowed on many airliners as aluminium is used in many aircraft structures
powdered aluminium can react with fesub2subosub3sub to form fe and alsub2subosub3sub this mixture is known as thermite which burns with a high energy output thermite can be produced inadvertently during grinding operations but the high ignition temperature makes incidents unlikely in most workshop environments
aluminium is primary among the factors that contribute to the loss of plant production on acid soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in phneutral soils the concentration in acid soils of toxic al3 cations increases and disturbs root growth and function
wheat s adaptation to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of organic compounds that bind to the harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism the first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat a group in the us department of agriculture showed that sorghums aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene as for wheat this is not the case in all plants

this element was discovered by louisnicolas vauquelin in 1798 as the oxide in beryl and in emeralds friedrich wöhler and a a bussy independently isolated the metal in 1828 by reacting potassium and beryllium chloride
the name beryllium comes from the greek βερυλλος beryllos beryl from prakrit veruliya from pāli veuriya akin or perhaps akin to tamil language veiru or viar to become pale in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl at one time beryllium was referred to as glucinium from greek sweet due to the sweet taste of its salts with the accompanying chemical symbol gl
due to its stiffness light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range beryllium metal is used in the defense and aerospace industries as lightweight structural materials in highspeed aircraft missiles space vehicles and communication satellites for example many highquality liquid fueled rockets use nozzles of pure be an example being the saturn v beryllium is used as an alloying agent in the production of beryllium copper which contains up to 25 beryllium berylliumcopper alloys are used in a wide variety of applications because of their combination of high electrical and thermal conductivity high strength and hardness nonmagnetic properties along with good corrosion and fatigue resistance these applications include the making of spot welding electrodes springs nonsparking tools and electrical contacts in the telecommunications industry tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons used for high power microwave applications beryllium copper is used in electrical spring contacts beryllium is used in the making of gyroscopes computer equipment watch springs and instruments where lightweight rigidity and dimensional stability are needed the james webb space telescope will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors because jwst will face a temperature of minus240 degrees celsius 33 kelvins the mirror is made of beryllium a material capable of handling extreme cold better than glass beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass mdash and thus remains more uniform mdash in such temperatures for the same reason the optics of the spitzer space telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal beryllium has been used in tweeter and midrange audio loudspeaker construction as an alternative to titanium and aluminium largely due to its lower density and greater rigidity
thin sheets of beryllium foil are used as windows in xray detectors to filter out visible light and allow only xrays to be detected sheets of beryllium ranging from thick down to thick are used as the output window in xray tubes allowing xrays to leave the tube while keeping a vacuum on the inside of the tube in the field of xray lithography beryllium is used for the reproduction of microscopic integrated circuits because of its low atomic number beryllium is almost transparent to energetic electrically charged particles therefore it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in collider particle physics experiments notably all four main detector experiments at the large hadron collider accelerator alice atlas cms lhcb use a beryllium beampipe

beryllium is an essential constituent of about 100 out of about 4000 known minerals the most important of which are bertrandite be4si2o7oh2 beryl al2be3si6o18 chrysoberyl al2beo4 and phenakite be2sio4 precious forms of beryl are aquamarine and emerald
the most important commercial sources of beryllium and its compounds are beryl and bertrandite beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957 currently most production of this metal is accomplished by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium metal the price on the us market for vacuumcast beryllium ingots was 338 us per pound 745kg in 2001
bef2 mg mgf2 be see also beryllium minerals of berylliums isotopes only 9be is stable cosmogenic 10be is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray spallation of oxygen and nitrogen because beryllium tends to exist in solution at ph levels less than about 55 and most rainwater has a ph less than 5 it will enter into solution and be transported to the earths surface via rainwater as the precipitation quickly becomes more alkaline beryllium drops out of solution cosmogenic 10be thereby accumulates at the soil surface where its relatively long halflife 151 million years permits a long residence time before decaying to 10 b 10be and its daughter products have been used to examine soil erosion soil formation from regolith the development of lateritic soils as well as variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores it is also formed in nuclear explosions by a reaction of fast neutrons with 13c in the carbon dioxide in air and is one of the historical indicators of past activity at nuclear test sites
the fact that 7be and 8be are unstable has profound cosmological consequences as it means that elements heavier than beryllium could not be produced by nuclear fusion in the big bang moreover the nuclear energy levels of 8be are such that carbon can be produced within stars thus making life possible see triplealpha process and big bang nucleosynthesis

both 10b 188 percent and 11b 812 percent possess nuclear spin that of boron10 has a value of 3 and that of boron11 32 these isotopes are therefore of use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron11 nucleus are available commercially the boron10 and boron11 nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei
the 10b isotope is good at capturing thermal neutrons from cosmic radiation it then undergoes fission producing a gamma ray an alpha particle and a lithium ion when this happens inside of an integrated circuit the fission products may then dump charge into nearby chip structures causing data loss bit flipping or single event upset in critical semiconductor designs depleted boronconsisting almost entirely of 11bis used to avoid this effect as one of radiation hardening measures 11b is a byproduct of the nuclear industry 11boron is also a candidate as a fuel for aneutronic fusion
the 10b isotope is good at capturing thermal neutrons and this quality has been used in both radiation shielding and in boron neutron capture therapy where a tumor is treated with a compound containing 10b is attached to a muscle and the patient treated with a relatively low dose of thermal neutrons which go on to cause energetic and short range alpha radiation in the tissue treated with the boron isotope
in nuclear reactors 10b is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems it can serve either function in the form of borosilicate rods or as boric acid in pressurized water reactors boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling it is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive
in future manned interplanetary spacecraft 10b has a theoretical role as structural material as boron fibers or bn nanotube material which also would serve a special role in the radiation shield one of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays which are mostly high energy protons is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft structural materials is in the form of high energy spallation neutrons such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as structural polyethylene but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in a way which dumps the absorption energy in the shielding far away from biological systems among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons 6li and 10b appear as potential spacecraft structural materials able to do double duty in this regard

berkelium was first synthesized by glenn t seaborg albert ghiorso stanley g thompson and kenneth street jr at the university of california berkeley in december 1949 the team used a cyclotron to bombard a milligram sized target of 241 am with alpha particles to produce 243bk halflife 45 hours and two free neutrons one of the longest lived isotopes of the element 249bk halflife 330 days was later synthesized by subjecting a 244 cm target with an intense beam of neutrons
19 radioisotopes of berkelium have been characterized with the most stable being 247bk with a halflife of 1380 years 248bk with a halflife of 9 years and 249bk with a halflife of 330 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 5 days and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 5 hours this element also has 2 meta states with the most stable being 248mbk t 237 hours the isotopes of berkelium range in atomic weight from 235057 u 235bk to 254091 u 254bk

bismuth compounds are used in cosmetics and in medical procedures as the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years alloy uses for bismuth metal as a replacement for lead have become an increasing part of bismuths commercial importance
bismuth is a brittle metal with a pinkish hue often occurring in its native form with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many refractive colors from yellow to blue when combusted with oxygen bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table such as lead thallium and antimony
no other metal is more naturally diamagnetic as opposed to superdiamagnetic than bismuth and it has a high electrical resistance of any metal it has the second lowest thermal conductivity and the highest hall coefficient when deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate bismuth is a semiconductor rather than a poor metal
elemental bismuth is one of very few substances of which the liquid phase is denser than its solid phase water being the bestknown example because bismuth expands on freezing it was long an important component of lowmelting typesetting alloys which needed to expand to fill printing molds
while bismuth was traditionally regarded as the element with the heaviest stable isotope it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds this was finally demonstrated in 2003 when researchers at the institut dastrophysique spatiale in orsay france measured the alpha emission halflife of sup209supbi to be 19 x 10sup19sup years over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe owing to its extraordinarily long halflife for nearly all applications bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive the radioactivity is of academic interest however because bismuth is one of few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and indeed theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory
bismuth new latin bisemutum from german wismuth perhaps from weiße masse white mass was confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements basilius valentinus described some of its uses in 1450 claude françois geoffroy showed in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead
artificial bismuth was commonly used in place of the actual mineral it was made by hammering tin into thin plates and cementing them by a mixture of white tartar saltpeter and arsenic stratified in a crucible over an open fire
bismuth was also known to the incas and used along with the usual copper and tin in a special bronze alloy for knives
in the earths crust bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold it is not usually economical to mine it as a primary product rather it is usually produced as a byproduct of the processing of other metal ores especially lead but also tungsten or other metal alloys
the most important ores of bismuth are bismuthinite and bismite in 2005 china was the top producer of bismuth with at least 40 of the world share followed by mexico and peru reports the british geological survey
according to the usgs world 2006 bismuth mine production was 5700 tonnes of which china produced 3000 tonnes mexico 1180 tonnes peru 950 tonnes and the balance canada kazakhstan and other nations world 2006 bismuth refinery production was 12000 tonnes of which china produced 8500 tonnes mexico 1180 tonnes belgium 800 tonnes peru 600 tonnes japan 510 tonnes and the balance canada and other nations
the difference between world bismuth mine production and refinery production reflects bismuths status as a byproduct metal bismuth travels in crude lead bullion which can contain up to 10 bismuth through several stages of refining until it is removed by the krollbetterton process or the betts process the krollbetterton process uses a pyrometallurgical separation from molten lead of calciummagnesiumbismuth drosses containing associated metals silver gold zinc some lead copper tellurium and arsenic which are removed by various fluxes and treatments to give highpurity bismuth metal over 99 bi the betts process takes cast anodes of lead bullion and electrolyzes them in a lead fluosilicatehydrofluosilicic acid electrolyte to yield a pure lead cathode and an anode slime containing bismuth bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals copper thus world bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic

though virtually unseen in nature highpurity bismuth can form distinctive hopper crystals these colorful laboratory creations are typically sold to collectors bismuth is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 273 c so crystals may be grown using a household stove although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than labgrown crystals
bismuth oxychloride is sometimes used in cosmetics bismuth subnitrate and bismuth subcarbonate are used in medicine bismuth subsalicylate the active ingredient in peptobismol is used as an antidiarrheal and to treat some other gastrointestinal diseases also the product bibrocathol is an organic molecule containing bismuth and is used to treat eye infections bismuth subgallate the active ingredient in devrom is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from flatulence or gas and stool poop
some other current uses many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are widely used for fire detection and suppression system safety devices bismuth is used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons a carrier for u 235 or u233 fuel in nuclear reactors bismuth has also been used in solders the fact that bismuth and many of its alloys expand slightly when they solidify make them ideal for this purpose bismuth subnitrate is a component of glazes that produces an iridescent luster finish bismuth telluride is an excellent thermoelectric material it is widely used a replacement propellant for xenon in hall effect thrusters in 1997 an antibody conjugate with bi213 which has a 45 minute halflife and decays with the emission of an alphaparticle was used to treat patients with leukemia in 2001 professor barry allen and dr graeme melville at st george hospital in sydney successfully produced bi213 in linac experiments which involved bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons this cancer research team used bi213 in its targeted alpha therapy tat program
in the early 1990s research began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications as noted above bismuth has been used in solders its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes a pigment in artists oil paint ingredient in freemachining brasses for plumbing applications ingredient in freecutting steels for precision machining properties a catalyst for making acrylic fibres in lowmelting alloys used in fire detection and extinguishing systems ingredient in lubricating greases dense material for fishing sinkers in crackling microstars dragons eggs in pyrotechnics as the oxide subcarbonate or subnitrate replacement for lead in shot and bullets the uk us and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds as many birds are prone to lead poisoning due to mistaken ingestion of lead instead of small stones and grit to aid digestion bismuthtin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is steel shot which is actually soft iron bismuth core bullets are also starting to appear for use in indoor shooting ranges where fine particles of lead from bullets impacting the backstop can be a chronic toxic inhalant problem owing to bismuths crystalline nature the bismuth bullets shatter into a nontoxic powder on impact making recovery and recycling easy the lack of malleability does however make bismuth unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets fabrique nationale de herstal uses bismuth in the projectiles for its fn 303 lesslethal riot gun
according to the usgs us bismuth consumption in 2006 totaled 2050 tonnes of which chemicals including pharmaceuticals pigments and cosmetics were 510 tonnes bismuth alloys 591 tonnes metallurgical additives 923 tonnes and the balance other uses
bismuth is not known to be toxic compared to its periodic table neighbours lead antimony and polonium although some compounds including bismuth chloride are toxic and should be handled with care

although chemistry is difficult when halflives are measured in seconds chromatography techniques were able to provide some data that bohrium behaves like a member of group 7 of the periodic table
it was synthesized in 1976 by soviet scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research at dubna who produced isotope 261bh with a halflife of 12 ms later data gave a half life of around 10 ms they did this by bombarding bismuth 204 with heavy nuclei of chromium 54
in 1981 a german research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried münzenberg at the gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung institute for heavy ion research in darmstadt were also able to confirm the soviet teams results and produce bohrium this time the longerlived bh262
the germans suggested the name nielsbohrium with symbol ns to honor the danish physicist niels bohr the soviets had suggested this name be given to element 105 dubnium
there was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus iupac adopted unnilseptium symbol uns as a temporary systematic element name for this element in 1994 a committee of iupac recommended that element 107 be named bohrium while this conforms to the names of other elements honoring individuals where only the surname is taken it was opposed by many who were concerned that it could be confused with boron despite this the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997
webelementscom bohrium apsidium bohrium los alamos national laboratory bohrium properties of bhosub3subcl carbon is a chemical element with the symbol c and atomic number 6 it is a group 14 nonmetallic tetravalent element that presents several allotropic forms of which the best known ones are graphite the thermodynamically stable form under normal conditions diamond and amorphous carbon there are three naturallyoccurring isotopes sup12supc and sup13supc are stable and sup14supc is radioactive decaying by 0158 mev βsupsup emission with a halflife of about 5700 years carbon is one of the few elements known to man since antiquity the name carbon comes from latin language carbo coal and in some romance languages the word carbon can refer both to the element and to coal
it is the 4th most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen it is ubiquitous in all known lifeforms and in the human body it is the second most abundant element by mass about 185 after oxygen this abundance together with the unique diversity of organic compounds and their unusual polymerforming ability at the temperatures commonly encountered on earth make this element the chemical basis of all known life
the physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form for example diamond is highly transparent while graphite is opaque and black diamond is among the hardest materials known while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper diamond has a very low electric conductivity while graphite is a very good conductor also diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of all known materials all the allotropic forms are solids under normal conditions
all forms of carbon are highly stable requiring high temperature to react even with oxygen the most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is 4 while 2 is found in carbon monoxide and other transition metal carbonyl complexes the largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones dolomites and carbon dioxide but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal peat oil and methane clathrates it forms more compounds than any other element almost ten million known
the english name carbon comes from the latin carbo for coal and charcoal and hence comes french charbon meaning charcoal in german dutch and danish the names for carbon are kohlenstoff koolstof and kulstof respectively all literally meaning coal substance
carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations diamonds were known probably as early as 2500 bce in china while carbon in the forms of charcoal was made around roman times by the same chemistry as it is today by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air
in 1722 rené a f de réaumur demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance now known to be carbon in 1772 antoine lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon when he burned samples of carbon and diamond then showed that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon dioxide per gram carl wilhelm scheele showed that graphite which had been thought of as a form of lead was instead a type of carbon in 1786 the french scientists claude louis berthollet gaspard monge and c a vandermonde then showed that this substance was carbon in their publication they proposed the name carbone latin carbonum for this element antoine lavoisier listed carbon as an element in his 1789 textbook
a new allotrope of carbon fullerene that was discovered in 1985 includes nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes their discoverers received the noble prize in chemistry in 1996 the resulting renewed interest in new forms lead to the discovery of further exotic allotropes including glassy carbon and the realization that amorphous carbon is not strictly amorphous
isotopes of carbon are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of neutrons varying from 2 to 16 carbon has two stable naturallyoccurring isotopes in 1961 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted the isotope carbon12 as the basis for atomic weights identification of carbon in nmr experiments is done with the isotope 13c
carbon14 14c is a naturallyoccurring radioisotope which occurs in trace amounts on earth of up to 1 part per trillion 00000000001 mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits particularly of peat and other organic materials because of its relatively short halflife of 5730 years 14c is virtually absent in ancient rocks but is created in the upper atmosphere lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays the abundance of 14c in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant but decreases predictably in their bodies after death this principle is used in radiocarbon dating discovered in 1949 which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40000 years
there are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortestlived of these is 8c which decays through proton emission and alpha decay and has a halflife of 198739x1021 s the exotic 19c exhibits a nuclear halo which means its radius is appreciably larger than would be expected if the nucleus was a sphere of constant density
the allotropes of carbon are the different molecular configurations that pure carbon can take the three relatively wellknown allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon graphite and diamond several exotic allotropes have also been synthesized or discovered such as fullerenes which include buckyballs carbon nanotubes carbon nanobuds and nanofibers aggregated diamond nanorods lonsdaleite glassy carbon
the amorphous form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a noncrystalline irregular glassy state which is essentially graphite but not held in a crystalline macrostructure it is present as a powder and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal lampblack soot and activated carbon
at normal pressures carbon takes the form of graphite in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons the resulting network is 2dimensional and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der waals forces this gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties the sheets slip easily past one another because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a πcloud graphite conducts electricity but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet this results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals the delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature
at very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope diamond having nearly twice the density of graphite here each atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four others thus making a 3dimensional network of puckered sixmembered rings of atoms diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium and thanks to the strength of the carboncarbon bonds is the hardest naturallyoccurring substance in terms of resistance to scratching contrary to the popular belief that diamonds are forever they are in fact thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into graphite
of the other discovered allotropes aggregated diamond nanorods have been synthesised in 2005 and are believed to be the hardest substance known yet carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997 it consists of a lowdensity clusterassembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose threedimensional web in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six and sevenmembered rings it is among the lightest known solids with a density of about 2 kgm similarly glassy carbon contains a high proportion of closed porosity
carbon exhibits remarkable properties some paradoxical different forms include the hardest naturally occurring substance diamond and also one of the softest substances graphite known moreover it has a great affinity for bonding with other small atoms including other carbon atoms and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with such atoms because of these properties carbon is known to form nearly ten million different compounds the large majority of all chemical compounds moreover carbon has the highest melting sublimation point of all elements at atmospheric pressure it has no actual melting point as its triple point is at 10 mpa 100 bar so it sublimates above 4000 k thus irrespective of its allotropic form carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as tungsten or rhenium although thermodynamically prone to oxidation carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature
carbon compounds form the basis of all life on earth and the carbonnitrogen cycle provides some of the energy produced by the sun and other stars although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions at standard temperature and pressure it resists all but the strongest oxidizers it does not react with sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid chlorine or any alkalis at elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides and will reduce such metal oxides as iron oxide to the metal this exothermic reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to control the carbon content of steel fe3o4 4cs 3fes 4cog with sulfur to form carbon disulfide and with steam in the coalgas reaction cs h2og cog h2g carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides such as the iron carbide cementite in steel and tungsten carbide widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools
the system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes
carbon is the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbon is abundant in the sun stars comets and in the atmospheres of most planets some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts
in combination with other elements carbon is found in the earths atmosphere in quantities of approximately 810 gigatonnes and dissolved in all water bodies approximately 36000 gigatonnes around 1900 gigatonnes are present in the biosphere hydrocarbons such as coal petroleum and natural gas contain carbon as well mdash coal reserves not resources amount to around 1000 gigatonnes and oil reserves around 150 gigatonnes with smaller amounts of calcium magnesium and iron carbon is a major component of very large masses carbonate rock limestone dolomite marble etc
coal is a significant commercial source of mineral carbon anthracite containing 9298 carbon and the largest source 4000 gt or 80 of coal gas and oil reserves of carbon in a form suitable for use as fuel
graphite is found in large quantities in new york and texas the united states russia mexico greenland and india
natural diamonds occur in the mineral kimberlite found in ancient volcanic necks or pipes most diamond deposits are in africa notably in south africa namibia botswana the republic of the congo and sierra leone there are also deposits in arkansas canada the russian arctic brazil and in northern and western australia
carbon is also found in abundance in the sun stars comets and atmospheres of most planets diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the cape of good hope about 30 of all industrial diamonds used in the us are now made synthetically
according to studies from the massachusetts institute of technology an estimate of the global carbon budget is
carbon14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9ndash15 km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen14 forming carbon14 and a proton
formation of the carbon atomic nucleus requires a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles helium nuclei within the core of a giant or supergiant star this happens in temperature and helium concentration conditions that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited and therefore no significant carbon was created during the big bang instead the interiors of stars in the horizontal branch transform three helium nuclei into carbon by means of this triplealpha process in order to be available for formation of life as we know it this carbon must then later be scattered into space as dust in supernovae explosions as part of the material which later forms second and thirdgeneration star systems which have planets accreted from such dust the solar system is one such thirdgeneration star system
one of the fusion mechanisms powering stars is the carbonnitrogen cycle
rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide eg 12co 13co and c18o are detectable in the submillimeter regime and are used in the study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds
under terrestrial conditions conversion of one element to another is very rare therefore the amount of carbon on earth is effectively constant thus processes that use carbon must obtain it somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else the paths that carbon follows in the environment make up the carbon cycle for example plants draw carbon dioxide out of their environment and use it to build biomass as in carbon respiration or the calvin cycle a process of carbon fixation some of this biomass is eaten by animals whereas some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide the carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop for example some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal which can burn with the release of carbon should bacteria not consume it
commerciallyviable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world but the most important sources economically are in south korea and austria graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin found in association with quartz mica and feldspars in schists gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins sometimes of a metre or more in thickness deposits of graphite in borrowdale cumberland england were at first of sufficient size and purity that until the 1800s pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood today smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water
the most prominent oxide of carbon is carbon dioxide co2 this was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere but is a minor component of the earths atmosphere today dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid h2co3 but as most compounds with multiple singlebonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable through this intermediate though resonancestabilized carbonate ions are produced some important minerals are carbonates notably calcite carbon disulfide cs2 is similar
the other common oxide is carbon monoxide co it is formed by incomplete combustion and is a colorless odorless gas the molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly polar resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules displacing oxygen which has a lower binding affinity cyanide cn has a similar structure but behaves much like a halide ion pseudohalogen for example it can form the nitride cyanogen molecule cn2 similar to diatomic halides other uncommon oxides are carbon suboxide the unstable dicarbon monoxide c2o and even carbon trioxide co3
with reactive metals such as tungsten carbon forms either carbides c4 or acetylides c22 to form alloys with high melting points these anions are also associated with methane and acetylene both very weak acids with an electronegativity of 25 carbon prefers to form covalent bonds a few carbides are covalent lattices like carborundum sic which resembles diamond
carbon has the ability to form very long chains with interconnecting cc bonds this property is called catenation carboncarbon bonds are strong and stable this property allows carbon to form an almost infinite number of compounds in fact there are more known carboncontaining compounds than all the compounds of the other chemical elements combined except those of hydrogen because almost all organic compounds contain hydrogen too
the simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon mdasha large family of organic molecules that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms chain length side chains and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules by iupac s definition all the other organic compounds are functionalized compounds of hydrocarbons
carbon occurs in all organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry when united with oxygen carbon forms carbon monoxide which is a product of incomplete combustion or carbon dioxide which is the main carbon source for plant growth when united with hydrogen it forms various flammable compounds called hydrocarbons which are important to industry as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of petrochemicals and as fossil fuels
when combined with oxygen and hydrogen carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars celluloses lignans chitins alcohols fats and aromatic esters carotenoids and terpenes with nitrogen it forms alkaloids and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics amino acids and proteins with the addition of phosphorus to these other elements it forms dna and rna the chemical codes of life and adenosine triphosphate atp the most important energytransfer molecules in all living cells
carbon is essential to all known living systems and without it life as we know it could not exist see alternative biochemistry the major economic use of carbon not in living or formerlyliving material such as food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil petroleum crude oil is used by the petrochemical industry to produce amongst others gasoline and kerosene through a distillation process in refineries cellulose is natural carboncontaining polymer produced by plants in the form of cellulose cotton linen hemp commerciallyvaluable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool cashmere and silk plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain the raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil
the uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied it can form alloys with iron of which the most common is carbon steel graphite is combined with clays to form the lead used in pencils used for writing and drawing it is also used as a lubricant and a pigment as a moulding material in glass manufacture in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and electroforming in brushes for electric motors and as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors
charcoal is used as a drawing material in artwork for grilling and in many other uses including iron smelting wood coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and space heating gem quality diamond is used in jewelry and industrial diamonds are used in drilling cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons and carbon fibre made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibres is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced lightweight composite materials carbon fiber is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of polyacrylonitrile pan and other organic substances the crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material and on the subsequent processing carbon fibres made from pan have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite but thermal processing may reorder the structure into a continuous rolled sheet the result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel
carbon black is used as the black pigment in printing ink artists oil paint and water colours carbon paper automotive finishes indian ink and laser printer toner carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds activated charcoal is used as an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks water purification and kitchen extractor hoods and in medicine to absorb toxins poisons or gases from the digestive system carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder carbides of silicon tungsten boron and titanium are among the hardest known materials and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass stone and metal
pure carbon has extremely low toxicity and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal it is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract for example consequently if it gets into body tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely carbon black was probably one of the first pigments to be used for tattooing and ötzi the iceman was found to have tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200 years after his death however inhalation of coal dust or soot carbon black in large quantities can be dangerous irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease coalworkers pneumoconiosis similarly diamond dust used as an abrasive can do harm if ingested or inhaled microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes and may accumulate in the lungs in these examples the harmful effects may result from contamination of the carbon particles with organic chemicals or heavy metals for example rather than from the carbon itself
carbon may also burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures as in the windscale fire which was caused by sudden release of stored wigner energy in the graphite core large accumulations of coal which have remained inert for millennia in the absence of oxygen may spontaneously combust when exposed to air for example in coal mine waste tips the great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as tetrodotoxin the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor oil plant ricinus communis cyanide cn and carbon monoxide and such essentials to life as glucose and protein

chlorine was discovered in 1774 by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele who called it dephlogisticated muriatic acid see phlogiston theory and mistakenly thought it contained oxygen scheele isolated chlorine by reacting mnosub2sub with hcl chlorine was given its current name in 1810 by sir humphry davy who insisted that it was in fact an element
chlorine gas also known as bertholite was first used as a weapon in world war i by germany on april 22 1915 in the second battle of ypres as described by the soldiers it had a distinctive smell of a mixture between pepper and pineapple it also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest it was pioneered by a german scientist later to be a nobel laureate fritz haber of the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin in collaboration with the german chemical conglomerate ig farben who developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy it is alleged that habers role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife clara immerwahr to suicide after its first use chlorine was utilized by both sides as a chemical weapon but it was soon replaced by the more deadly gases phosgene and mustard gas
chlorine gas has also been used by insurgents in the iraq war as a chemical weapon to terrorize the local population and coalition forces on march 17 2007 for example three chlorine filled trucks were detonated in the anbar province killing 2 and sickening over 350 other chlorine bomb attacks resulted in higher death tolls with more than 30 deaths on two separate occasions most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast the iraqi authorities have tightened up security for chlorine which is essential for providing safe drinking water for the population
chlorine has isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 32 to 40 there are two principal stable isotopes 35cl 7577 and 37cl 2423 giving chlorine atoms in bulk an apparent atomic weight of 355nbspgmol
trace amounts of radioactive sup36supcl exist in the environment in a ratio of about 7x1013 to 1 with stable isotopes 36cl is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36 ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons in the subsurface environment 36cl is generated primarily as a result of neutron capture by 35cl or muon capture by 40 ca 36cl decays to 36 s and to 36 ar with a combined halflife of 308000 years the halflife of this hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for geologic dating in the range of 60000 to 1 million years additionally large amounts of 36cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958 the residence time of 36cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week thus as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water 36cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present 36cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences including dating ice and sediments
chlorine gas is diatomic with the formula cl2 it combines readily with all elements except osub2sub and nsub2sub and the noble gases compounds with oxygen nitrogen and xenon are known but do not form by direct reaction of the elements chlorine is not as extremely reactive as fluorine pure chlorine gas does however support combustion of organic compounds such as hydrocarbons although the carbon component tends to burn incompletely with much of it remaining as soot at 10 c and atmospheric pressure one liter of water dissolves 310 l of gaseous chlorine and at 30c 1 l of water dissolves only 177 liters of chlorine
this element is a member of the salt forming halogen series and is extracted from chlorides through oxidation often by electrolysis as the chloride ion cl it is also the most abundant dissolved ion in ocean water
see also halide minerals in nature chlorine is found primarily as the chloride ion a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the oceans mdash about 19 of the mass of seawater is chloride ions even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the dead sea and in underground brine deposits most chloride salts are soluble in water thus chloridecontaining minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground common chloride minerals include halite sodium chloride sylvite potassium chloride and carnallite potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate over 2000 naturallyoccurring organic chlorine compounds are known
industrially elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water along with chlorine this chloralkali process yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide according to the following chemical equation
2 nacl 2 hsub2subo cl2 hsub2sub 2 naoh
chlorine can be manufactured by electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution brine the production of chlorine results in the coproducts caustic soda sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrogen gas h2 these two products as well as chlorine are highly reactive chlorine can also be produced by the electrolysis of a solution of potassium chloride in which case the coproducts are hydrogen and caustic potash potassium hydroxide there are three industrial methods for the extraction of chlorine by electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceeding according to the following equations

mercury cell electrolysis also known as the castnerkellner process was the first method used at the end of the nineteenth century to produce chlorine on an industrial scale the rocking cells used have been improved over the years today in the primary cell titanium anodes formerly graphite ones are placed in a sodium or potassium chloride solution flowing over a liquid mercury cathode when a potential difference is applied and current flows chlorine is released at the titanium anode and sodium or potassium dissolves in the mercury cathode forming an amalgam this flows continuously into a separate reactor denuder or secondary cell where it is usually converted back to mercury by reaction with water producing hydrogen and sodium or potassium hydroxide at a commercially useful concentration 50 by weight the mercury is then recycled to the primary cell
the mercury process is the least energyefficient of the three main technologies mercury diaphragm and membrane and there are also concerns about mercury emissions
it is estimated that there are still around 100 mercurycell plants operating worldwide in japan mercurybased chloralkali production was virtually phased out by 1987 except for the last two potassium chloride units shut down in 2003 in the united states there will be only five mercury plants remaining in operation by the end of 2008 in europe mercury cells accounted for 43 of capacity in 2006 and western european producers have committed to closing or converting all remaining chloralkali mercury plants by 2020
in diaphragm cell electrolysis an asbestos or polymerfiber diaphragm separates cathode and anode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from remixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode this technology was also developed at the end of the nineteenth century there are several variants of this process the le sueur cell 1893 the hargreavesbird cell 1901 the gibbs cell 1908 and the townsend cell 1904 the cells vary in construction and placement of the diaphragm with some having the diaphragm in direct contact with the cathode
the salt solution brine is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine partially depleted
as a result diaphragm methods produce alkali that is quite dilute about 12 and of lower purity than do mercury cell methods but diaphragm cells are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment they also operate at a lower voltage resulting in an energy savings over the mercury cell method
development of this technology began in the 1970s the electrolysis cell is divided into two rooms by a cation permeable membrane acting as an ion exchanger saturated sodium or potassium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving at a lower concentration sodium or potassium hydroxide solution is circulated through the cathode compartment exiting at a higher concentration a portion of the concentrated sodium hydroxide solution leaving the cell is diverted as product while the remainder is diluted with deionized water and passed through the electrolyzer again
this method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium or potassium hydroxide at about 32 concentration but requires very pure brine
although a much lower production scale is involved electrolytic diaphragm and membrane technologies are also used industrially to recover chlorine from hydrochloric acids solutions producing hydrogen but no caustic alkali as a coproduct
furthermore electrolysis of fused chloride salts downs process also enables chlorine to be produced in this case as a byproduct of the manufacture of metallic sodium or magnesium
before electrolytic methods were used for chlorine production the direct oxidation of hydrogen chloride with oxygen or air was exercised in the deacon process
4 hcl o2 2 cl2 2 h2o
this reaction is accomplished with the use of cucl2 as a catalyst and is performed at high temperarature about 400c the amount of extracted chlorine is approximately 80 due to the extremely corrosive reaction mixture industrial use of this method is difficult and several pilot trials failed in the past nevertheless recent developments are promising
another earlier process to produce chlorine was to heat brine with acid and manganese dioxide
2 nacl 2h2so4 mno2 na2so4 mnso4 2 h2o cl2
using this process chemist carl wilhelm scheele was the first to isolate chlorine in a laboratory the manganese can be recovered by the weldon process
small amounts of chlorine gas can be made in the laboratory by putting concentrated hydrochloric acid in a flask with a side arm and rubber tubing attached manganese dioxide is then added and the flask stoppered the reaction is not greatly exothermic as chlorine is denser than air it can be easily collected by placing the tube inside a flask where it will displace the air once full the collecting flask can be stoppered
in the laboratory small amounts of chlorine gas can also be created by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid typically about 5m to sodium hypochlorite or sodium chlorate solution
largescale production of chlorine involves several steps and many pieces of equipment the description below is typical of a membrane plant the plant also produces simultaneously sodium hydroxide referred to in the industry as caustic soda and hydrogen gas a typical plant consists of brine productiontreatment cell operations chlorine cooling drying chlorine compression liquefaction liquid chlorine storage loading caustic handling evaporation storage loading and hydrogen handling
key to the production of chlorine is the operation of the brine saturationtreatment system maintaining a properly saturated solution with the correct purity is vital especially for membrane cells many plants have a salt pile which is sprayed with recycled brine others have slurry tanks that are fed raw salt
the raw brine is partially or totally treated with sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate and a flocculant to reduce calcium magnesium and other impurities the brine proceeds to a large clarifier or a filter where the impurities are removed the total brine is additionally filtered before entering ion exchangers to further remove impurities at several points in this process the brine is tested for hardness and strength
after the ion exchangers the brine is considered pure and is transferred to storage tanks to be pumped into the cell room brine fed to the cell line is heated to the correct temperature to control exit brine temperatures according to the electrical load brine exiting the cell room must be treated to remove residual chlorine and control ph before being returned to the saturation stage this can be accomplished via dechlorination towers with acid and sodium bisulfite addition failure to remove chlorine can result in damage to the cells brine should be monitored for accumulation of chlorate and sulfate and either have treatment systems in place or purging of the brine loop to maintain safe levels since chlorate can diffuse through the membranes and contaminate the caustic while sulfate can damage the anode surface coating
the building that houses the many electrolytic cells is usually called a cell room or cell house although some plants are built outdoors this building contains support structures for the cells connections for supplying electrical power to the cells and piping for the fluids monitoring and control of the temperatures of the feed caustic and brine is done to control exit temperatures also monitored are the voltages of each cell which vary with the electrical load on the cell room that is used to control the rate of production monitoring and control of the pressures in the chlorine and hydrogen headers is also done via pressure control valves
direct electrical current is supplied via rectifiers plant load is controlled by varying the current to the cells as the current is increased flow rates for brine caustic and deionized water are increased while lowering the feed temperatures
chlorine gas exiting the cell line must be cooled and dried since the exit gas can be over 80º c and contains moisture that allows chlorine gas to be corrosive to iron piping cooling the gas allows for a large amount of moisture from the brine to condense out of the gas stream cooling also improves the efficiency of the compression and liquefaction stage that follows chlorine exiting is ideally between 18º c and 25º c after cooling the gas stream passes through a series of towers with counter flowing sulfuric acid these towers progressively remove any remaining moisture from the chlorine gas after exiting the drying towers the chlorine is filtered to remove any sulfuric acid droplets
several methods of compression may be used liquid ring reciprocating or centrifugal the chlorine gas is compressed at this stage and may be further cooled by inter and aftercoolers after compression it flows to the liquefiers where it is cooled enough to liquefy non condensible gases and remaining chlorine gas are vented off as part of the pressure control of the liquefaction systems these gases are routed to a gas scrubber producing sodium hypochlorite or used in the production of hydrochloric acid by combustion with hydrogen or ethylene dichloride by reaction with ethylene
liquid chlorine is typically gravityfed to storage tanks it can be loaded into rail or road tankers via pumps or padded with compressed dry gas
caustic fed to the cell room flows in a loop that is simultaneously bled off to storage with a part diluted with deionized water and returned to the cell line for strengthening within the cells the caustic exiting the cell line must be monitored for strength to maintain safe concentrations too strong or too weak a solution may damage the membranes membrane cells typically produce caustic in the range of 30 to 33 by weight the feed caustic flow is heated at low electrical loads to control its exit temperature higher loads require the caustic to be cooled to maintain correct exit temperatures the caustic exiting to storage is pulled from a storage tank and may be diluted for sale to customers who require weak caustic or for use on site another stream may be pumped into a multiple effect evaporator set to produce commercial 50 caustic rail cars and tanker trucks are loaded at loading stations via pumps
hydrogen produced may be vented unprocessed directly to the atmosphere or cooled compressed and dried for use in other processes on site or sold to a customer via pipeline cylinders or trucks some possible uses are hydrochloric acid or hydrogen peroxide production desulfurization of petroleum oils and use as a fuel in boilers or fuel cells
production of chlorine is extremely energy intensive energy consumption per unit weight of product is not far below that for iron and steel manufacture and greater than for the production of glass or cement
since electricity is an indispensable raw material for the production of chlorine the energy consumption corresponding to the electrochemical reaction cannot be reduced energy savings arise primarily through applying more efficient technologies and reducing ancillary energy use

chlorine exists in all odd numbered oxidation states from 1 to 7 as well as the elemental state of zero progressing through the states hydrochloric acid can be oxidized using manganese dioxide or hydrogen chloride gas oxidized catalytically by air to form elemental chlorine gas the solubility of chlorine in water is increased if the water contains dissolved alkali hydroxide this is due to disproportionation
cl2 2oh cl clo h2o
in hot concentrated alkali solution disproportionation continues
2clo cl clo2 clo clo2 cl clo3
sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate can be crystallized from solutions formed by the above reactions if their crystals are heated they undergo the final disproportionation step

chlorines principal applications are in the production of a wide range of industrial and consumer products for example it is used in making plastics solvents for dry cleaning and metal degreasing textiles agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals insecticides dyestuffs etc
chlorine is an important chemical for water purification in disinfectants and in bleach it is used in the form of hypochlorous acid to kill bacteria and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools however in most private swimming pools chlorine itself is not used but rather sodium hypochlorite household bleach formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated see also chlorination
elemental chlorine is an oxidizer it undergoes halogen substitution reactions with lower halide salts for example chlorine gas bubbled through a solution of bromide or iodide anions oxidizes them to bromine and iodine respectively
like the other halogens chlorine participates in freeradical substitution reactions with hydrogencontaining organic compounds this reaction is often but not invariably nonregioselective and hence may result in a mixture of isomeric products it is often difficult to control the degree of substitution as well so multiple substitutions are common if the different reaction products are easily separated eg by distillation substitutive freeradical chlorination in some cases accompanied by concurrent thermal dehydrochlorination may be a useful synthetic route industrial examples of this are the production of methyl chloride methylene chloride chloroform and carbon tetrachloride from methane allyl chloride from propylene and trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene from 12dichloroethane
like the other halides chlorine undergoes electrophilic additions reactions most notably the chlorination of alkenes and aromatic compounds with a lewis acid catalyst organic chlorine compounds tend to be less reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions than the corresponding bromine or iodine derivatives but they tend to be cheaper they may be activated for reaction by substituting with a tosylate group or by the use of a catalytic amount of sodium iodide
chlorine is used extensively in organic and inorganic chemistry as an oxidizing agent and in substitution reactions because chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an organic compound due to its electronegativity
chlorine compounds are used as intermediates in the production of a number of important commercial products that do not contain chlorine examples are polycarbonates polyurethanes silicones polytetrafluoroethylene carboxymethyl cellulose and propylene oxide
chlorine is used in the manufacture of numerous organic chlorine compounds the most significant of which in terms of production volume are 12dichloroethane and vinyl chloride intermediates in the production of pvc other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride methylene chloride chloroform vinylidene chloride trichloroethylene perchloroethylene allyl chloride epichlorohydrin chlorobenzene dichlorobenzenes and trichlorobenzenes
chlorine is also used in the production of chlorates and in bromine extraction
chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer which may react with flammable materials
never use abc dry chemical to fight a chlorine fire the resulting chemical reaction with the ammonium phosphate will release toxic gases andor result in an explosion water fogs or cafs should be used to extinguish the material

calcium is an important component of a healthy diet calcium is essential for the normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth and calcium requirements must be met throughout life longterm calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures while a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation overretention can cause hypercalcemia elevated levels of calcium in the blood impaired kidney function and decreased absorption of other minerals high calcium intakes or high calcium absorption were previously thought to contribute to the development of kidney stones however more recent studies show that high dietary calcium intakes actually decrease the risk for kidney stones vitamin d is needed to absorb calcium dairy products such as milk and cheese are a wellknown source of calcium however some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people particularly those of non indoeuropean descent are lactoseintolerant leaving them unable to consume nonfermented dairy products in quantities larger than about half a liter per serving others such as vegans avoid dairy products for ethical and health reasons fortunately many good sources of calcium exist these include seaweeds such as kelp wakame and hijiki nuts and seeds like almonds and sesame blackstrap molasses beans oranges amaranth collard greens okra rutabaga broccoli dandelion leaves kale sardines and fortified products such as orange juice and soy milk an overlooked source of calcium is eggshell which can be ground into a powder and mixed into food or a glass of water the calcium content of most foods can be found in the usda national nutrient database
calcium supplements are used to prevent and to treat calcium deficiencies there are conflicting recommendations about when to take calcium supplements however most experts agree that no more than 500 mg should be taken at a time because the percent of calcium absorbed decreases as the amount of calcium in the supplement increases
in july 2006 a report citing research from fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle washington claimed that women in their 50s gained 5 pounds less in a period of 10 years by taking more than 500 mg of calcium supplements than those who did not however the doctor in charge of the study dr alejandro j gonzalez also noted it would be going out on a limb to suggest calcium supplements as a weightlimiting aid calcium carbonate is the most common and least expensive calcium supplement it can be difficult to digest and causes gas in some people taking magnesium with it can help to prevent constipation calcium carbonate is 40 elemental calcium 1000 mg will provide 400 mg of calcium it is recommended to take this supplement with food to aid in absorption in some calcium supplements based on calcium carbonate vitamin d is added to aid in absorption vitamin d is needed for the absorption of calcium from the stomach and for the functioning of calcium in the body coral calcium is a salt of calcium derived from fossilized coral reefs coral calcium is comprised of calcium carbonate and trace minerals calcium citrate is more easily absorbed bioavailability is 25 times higher than calcium carbonate easier to digest and less likely to cause constipation and gas than calcium carbonate it also has a lower risk of contributing to the formation of kidney stones calcium citrate is about 21 elemental calcium 1000 mg will provide 210 mg of calcium it is more expensive than calcium carbonate and more of it must be taken to get the same amount of calcium calcium phosphate costs more than calcium carbonate but less than calcium citrate it is easily absorbed and is less likely to cause constipation and gas than either calcium lactate and calcium aspartate are both more difficult to digest and are more expensive than calcium carbonate calcium chelates have been chemically bonded with an agent that the body recognizes as food this form is generally known to be better absorbed by the human body than all other forms of calcium due to the bond
the national nutritional food association nnfa newport beach calif defines a chelate very specifically and several criteria must be met in order for chelation to actually occur some of the claimed chelates on the market are the various krebs citric acid cycle chelates such as citrate malate and aspartate dicalcium malate chelated with malic acid is a newer form of a true calcium chelate it contains a high amount of elemental calcium 30
such studies often do not test calcium alone but rather combinations of calcium and vitamin d randomized controlled trials found both positive and negative benefit the different results may be explained by doses of calcium and underlying rates of calcium supplementation in the control groups however it is clear that increasing the intake of calcium promotes deposition of calcium in the bones where it is of more benefit in preventing the compression fractures resulting from the osteoporotic thinning of the dendritic web of the bodies of the vertebrae than it is at preventing the more serious cortical bone fractures which happen at hip and wrist
a metaanalysis by the international cochrane collaboration of two randomized controlled trialsfound that calcium might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of adenomatous colonic polyps

on 26 july 1761 johann gottlob lehmann found an orangered mineral in the ural mountains which he named siberian red lead though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components the material was in fact lead chromate with a formula of pbcro4 now known as the mineral crocoite
in 1770 peter simon pallas visited the same site as lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had very useful properties as a pigment in paints the use of siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly a bright yellow made from crocoite became a color in fashion
in 1797 louis nicolas vauquelin received samples of crocoite ore he was able to produce chromium oxide with a chemical formula of cro3 by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid in 1798 vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven he was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones such as ruby or emerald later that year he successfully isolated chromium atoms
during the 1800s chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in tanning salts but now metal alloys account for 85 of the use of chromium the remainder is used in the chemical industry and refractory and foundry industries
chromium was named after the greek word chrôma meaning color because of the many colorful compounds made from it
chromium is mined as chromite fecr2o4 ore about twofifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in the world are produced in south africa kazakhstan india russia and turkey are also substantial producers untapped chromite deposits are plentiful but geographically concentrated in kazakhstan and southern africa
approximately 15 million tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000 and converted into approximately 4 million tons of ferrochrome with an approximate market value of 25 billion united states dollars
though native chromium deposits are rare some native chromium metal has been discovered the udachnaya mine in russia produces samples of the native metal this mine is a kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds and the reducing environment so provided helped produce both elemental chromium and diamond see also chromium minerals
chromium is obtained commercially by heating the ore in the presence of aluminium or silicon
chromium is a member of the transition metals in group 6 chromium0 has an electronic configuration of 4s13d5 due to the lower energy of the high spin configuration chromium exhibits a wide range of possible oxidation states the most common oxidation states of chromium are 2 3 and 6 with 3 being the most stable 1 4 and 5 are rare chromium compounds of oxidation state 6 are powerful oxidants
chromium is passivated by oxygen forming a thin usually a few atoms thick being transparent because of thickness protective oxide surface layer with another element such as nickel andor iron it forms a compound called a spinal structure which being very dense prevents diffusion of oxygen into the underlying layer in iron or plain carbon steels the oxygen actually migrates into the underlying material chromium is usually plated on top of a nickel layer which may or may not have been copper plated first chromium as opposite to most other metals such as iron and nickel does not suffer from hydrogen embrittlement it does though suffer from nitrogen embrittlement and hence no straight chromium alloy has ever been developed below the pourbaix diagram can be seen it is important to understand that the diagram only displays the thermodynamic data and it does not display any details of the rates of reaction
potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent and is the preferred compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace organics it is used as a saturated solution in concentrated sulfuric acid for washing the apparatus for this purpose however sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility 5 g100 ml vs 20 g100 ml respectively chrome green is the green oxide of chromium cr2o3 used in enamel painting and glass staining chrome yellow is a brilliant yellow pigment pbcro4 used by painters

cadmium is an occupational hazard associated with industrial processes such as metal plating and the production of nickelcadmium batteries pigments plastics and other synthetics the primary route of exposure in industrial settings is inhalation inhalation of cadmiumcontaining fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis pulmonary edema and death
cadmium is also a potential environmental hazard human exposures to environmental cadmium are primarily the result of the burning of fossil fuels and municipal wastes however there have been notable instances of toxicity as the result of longterm exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water in the decades following world war ii japanese mining operations contaminated the jinzu river with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals consequently cadmium accumulated in the rice crops growing along the riverbanks downstream of the mines the local agricultural communities consuming the contaminated rice developed itaiitai disease and renal abnormalities including proteinuria and glucosuria cadmium is one of six substances banned by the european unions restriction on hazardous substances rohs directive which bans carcinogens in computers
cadmium and several cadmiumcontaining compounds are known carcinogens and can induce many types of cancer
current research has found that cadmium toxicity may be carried into the body by zinc binding proteins in particular proteins that contain zinc finger protein structures zinc and cadmium are in the same group on the periodic table contain the same common oxidation state 2 and when ionized are almost the same size due to these similarities cadmium can replace zinc in many biological systems in particular systems that contain softer ligands such as sulfur cadmium can bind up to ten times more strongly than zinc in certain biological systems and is notoriously difficult to remove in addition cadmium can replace magnesium and calcium in certain biological systems although these replacements are rare
tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population it has been estimated that about 10 of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking the absorption of cadmium from the lungs is much more effective than that from the gut and as much as 50 of the cadmium inhaled via cigarette smoke may be absorbed
on average smokers have 45 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 23 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than nonsmokers despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking no significant effect on blood cadmium concentrations could be detected in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke
while working with cadmium it is important to do so under a fume hood or with the use of an appropriate respirator to protect against dangerous fumes solder for example which may contain cadmium should be handled with care

cerium was discovered in bastnäs in sweden by jöns jakob berzelius and wilhelm hisinger and independently in germany by martin heinrich klaproth both in 1803 cerium was so named by berzelius after the dwarf planet discovered two years earlier 1801 as originally isolated cerium was in the form of its oxide and was named ceria a term that is still used the metal itself was too electopositive to be isolated by thencurrent smelting technology a characteristic of earth metals in general but the development of electrochemistry by humphry davy was only five years into the future and then the earths were well on their way to yielding up their contained metals ceria as isolated in 1803 contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from bastnaes sweden and thus only contained about 45 of what is now known to be pure ceria it was not until mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and didymia in the late 1830s that ceria was obtained pure as an historical aside wilhelm hisinger was a wealthy mine owner and amateur scientist and sponsor of berzelius he owned or controlled the mine at bastnaes and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock the tungstein of bastnaes now known as cerite that he had in his mine mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as berzelius and was undoubtedly persuaded by the latter to investigate ceria further when the rare earths were first discovered since they were strong bases like the oxides of calcium or magnesium they were thought to be divalent thus ceric cerium was thought to be trivalent and the oxidation state ratio was therefore thought to be 15 berzelius was extremely annoyed to keep on getting the ratio 133 he was after all one of the finest analytical chemists in europe but he was a better analyst than he thought since 133 was the correct answer

the two oxidation states of cerium differ enormously in basicity ceriumiii is a strong base comparable to the other trivalent lanthanides but ceriumiv is weak this difference has always allowed cerium to be by far the most readily isolated and purified of all the lanthanides otherwise a notoriously difficult group of elements to separate a wide range of procedures have been devised over the years to exploit the difference among the better ones
leaching the mixed hydroxides with dilute nitric acid the trivalent lanthanides dissolve in ceriumfree condition and tetravalent cerium remains in the insoluble reside as a concentrate to be further purified by other means a variation on this uses hydrochloric acid and the calcined oxides from bastnaesite but the separation is less sharp precipitating cerium from a nitrate or chloride solution using potassium permanganate and sodium carbonate in a 14 molar ratio boiling rare earth nitrate solutions with potassium bromate and marble chips
using the classical methods of rare earth separation there was a considerable advantage to a strategy of removing cerium from the mixture at the beginning cerium typically comprised 45 of the cerite or monazite rare earths and removing it early greatly reduced the bulk of what needed to be further processed or the cost of reagents to be associated with such processing however not all cerium purification methods relied on basicity ceric ammonium nitrate ammonium hexanitratocerateiv crystallization from nitric acid was one purification method ceriumiv nitrate hexanitratoceric acid was more readily extractable into certain solvents eg trinbutyl phosphate than the trivalent lanthanides however modern practice in china seems to be to do purification of cerium by countercurrent solvent extraction in its trivalent form just like the other lanthanides
ceriumiv is a strong oxidant under acidic conditions but stable under alkaline conditions when it is ceriumiii that becomes a strong reductant easily oxidized by molecular dioxygen or air this ease of oxidation under alkaline conditions leads to the occasional geochemical parting of the ways between cerium and the trivalent light lanthanides under supergene weathering conditions leading variously to the negative cerium anomaly or to the formation of the mineral cerianite airoxidation of alkaline ceriumiii is the most economical way to get to ceriumiv which can then be handled in acid solution

curium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol cm and atomic number 96 a radioactive metallic transuranic element of the actinide series curium is produced by bombarding plutonium with alpha particles helium ions and was named for marie curie and her husband pierre
the isotope curium248 has been synthesized only in milligram quantities but curium242 and curium244 are made in multigram amounts which allows for the determination of some of the elements properties curium244 can be made in quantity by subjecting plutonium to neutron bombardment curium does not occur in nature there are few commercial applications for curium but it may one day be useful in radioisotope thermoelectric generators curium bioaccumulates in bone tissue where its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation
a rare earth element homolog curium is somewhat chemically similar to gadolinium but with a more complex crystal structure chemically reactive its metal is silverywhite in color and the element is more electropositive than aluminium most trivalent curium compounds are slightly yellow
curium has been studied greatly as a potential fuel for radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtg curium242 can generate up to 120 watts of thermal energy per gram wg however its very short halflife makes it undesirable as a power source for longterm use curium242 can decay by alpha emission to plutonium238 which is the most common fuel for rtgs curium244 has also been studied as an energy source for rtgs having a maximum energy density 3 wg but produces a large amount of neutron radiation from spontaneous fission curium243 with a 30 year halflife and good energy density of 16 wg would seem to make an ideal fuel but it produces significant amounts of gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products

the pattern is that the oddmass number isotopes are fissile the evenmass number isotopes are not and can only neutron capture but very slowly therefore the evenmass isotopes accumulate in a thermal reactor as burnup increases
the mox which is to be used in power reactors should contain little or no curium as the neutron activation of 248cm will create californium which is a strong neutron emitter the californium would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to workers hence if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present

weighable amounts of californium make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities
252cf 2645year halflife is a very strong neutron emitter and is thus extremely radioactive and harmful one microgram spontaneously emits 170 million neutrons per minute 249cf is formed from the beta decay of 249 bk and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor
californium has no biological role and only a few californium compounds have been made and studied included among these are californium oxide cf2 o 3 californium trichloride cf cl 3 and californium oxychloride cfocl the only californium ion that is stable in aqueous solution is the californiumiii cation
the element does have some specialist applications dealing with its radioactivity but otherwise is largely too difficult to produce to have widespread useful significance as a material some of its uses are neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors calibrating instrumentation treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective radiography of aircraft to detect metal fatigue airport neutronactivation detectors of explosives portable metal detectors neutron moisture gauges used to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells portable neutron source in gold and silver prospecting for onthespot analysis
in october 2006 it was announced that on three occasions californium249 atoms had been bombarded with calcium 48 ions to produce ununoctium element 118 making this the heaviest element ever synthesized
251cf is famous for having a very small critical mass high lethality and short period of toxic environmental irradiation relative to radioactive elements commonly used for radiation explosive weaponry creating speculation about possible use in pocket nukes this urban legend is unfounded since it would be very difficult to make a 251cf bomb weighing less than 2nbspkg and the costs of such a bomb would be prohibitive other weaponry uses such as showering an area with californium are not impossible but are seen as inhumane and are subject to inclement weather conditions and porous terrain considerations often cited as a consideration is the cost of producing californium in quantity but the cost citations are usually due to extra fees that laboratory materials companies insert for sake of caution and market needs
pertaining to californiums nuclear fuel cycle it is important to make sure that the curium concentration in mox nuclear fuel is kept low as neutron irradiation of curium will convert some of it to californium the californium will then cause the used fuel to be more difficult to handle as the californium is a strong neutron emitter through spontaneous fission hence the concentration of curium and californium among the minor actinides are important
californium was first synthesized at the university of california berkeley by researchers stanley g thompson kenneth street jr albert ghiorso and glenn t seaborg in 1950 it was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered and the team announced their discovery on march 17 1950 it was named after the us state of california and for the university of california system
to produce element 98 the team bombarded a microgramsized target of 242 cm with 35 mev alpha particles in the 5foot 152nbspm berkeley cyclotron which produced atoms of 245cf halflife 44 minutes and a free neutron
due to its 27 million per gram price tag only 8 grams of 252cf have been made in the western world since its discovery by seaborg in 1950 plutonium supplied by the united kingdom to the us under the 1958 usuk mutual defence agreement was used for californium production
nineteen radioisotopes of californium have been characterized the most stable being 251cf with a halflife of 898 years 249cf with a halflife of 351 years and 250cf with a halflife of 13 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 27 years and the majority of these have halflives shorter than 20 minutes the isotopes of californium range in atomic weight from 237062 u 237cf to 256093 u 256cf
although californium does not occur naturally on earth the element and its decay products occur elsewhere in the universe their electromagnetic emissions are regularly observed in the spectra of supernovae

the variant spelling cesium is used especially in north american english and the iupac has recognized it as a variant spelling since 1993 but caesium is the spelling used by the iupac
the emission spectrum of caesium has two bright lines in the blue part of the spectrum along with several other lines in the red yellow and green this metal is silvery gold in color and is both soft and ductile caesium is the second most electropositive and alkaline of the chemical elements and has the second lowest ionization potential after francium caesium is the least abundant of the five nonradioactive alkali metals technically francium is the least common alkali metal but since it is highly radioactive with an estimated 30 grams in the entire earths crust at one time its abundance can be considered zero in practical terms
along with gallium francium and mercury caesium is among the only metals that are liquid at or near room temperature caesium reacts explosively in cold water and also reacts with ice at temperatures above 157nbspk
caesium hydroxide csoh is a very strong base and will rapidly etch the surface of glass csoh is often stated to be the strongest base but in fact many compounds such as nbutyllithium and sodium amide are stronger
there is an account that caesium reacting with fluorine takes up more fluorine than it stoichiometrically should it is possible that after the salt csfminus has formed the cs ion which has the same electronic structure as elemental xenon can like xenon be oxidised further by fluorine and form traces of a higher fluoride such as csf3 analogous to xef2
probably the most widespread use of caesium today is in caesium formate based drilling fluids for the oil industry the high density of the caesium formate brine up to 23 sg coupled with the relative benignity of 133cs reduces the requirement for toxic highdensity suspended solids in the drilling fluid which is a significant technological engineering and environmental advantage caesium is also notably used in atomic clocks which are accurate to seconds in many thousands of years since 1967 the international system of measurements bases its unit of time the second on the properties of caesium si defines the second as 9192631770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine energy levels of the ground state of the 133cs atom
134cs has been used in hydrology as a measure of caesium output by the nuclear power industry this isotope is used because while it is less prevalent than either 133cs or sup137supcs 134cs can be produced solely by nuclear reactions 135cs has also been used in this function like other elements of group 1 caesium has a great affinity for oxygen and is used as a getter in vacuum tubes this metal is also used in photoelectric cells due to its ready emission of electrons caesium was used as a propellant in early ion engines it used a method of ionization to strip the outer electron from the propellant by simple contact with tungsten caesium use as a propellant was discontinued when hughes research laboratory conducted a study finding xenon gas as a suitable replacement caesium is used as a catalyst in the hydrogenation of certain organic compounds radioactive isotopes of caesium are used in the medical field to treat certain types of cancer caesium fluoride is widely used in organic chemistry as a base and as a source of anhydrous fluoride ion caesium vapor is used in many common magnetometers because of their high density caesium chloride solutions are commonly used in molecular biology for density gradient ultracentrifugation primarily for the isolation of viral particles subcellular organelles and fractions and nucleic acids from biological samples caesium nitrate is used as oxidiser to burn silicon in infrared flares like the luu19 flare because it emits much of its light in the near infrared spectrum caesium137 is an extremely common radioisotope used as a gammaemitter in industrial applications such as moisture density gauges leveling gauges thickness gauges welllogging devices used to measure the thickness of rockstrata caesium is also used as an internal standard in spectrophotometry caesium has been used to reduce the radar signature of exhaust plumes in military aircraft
caesium latin caesius meaning blueish grey was spectroscopically discovered by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff in 1860 in mineral water from dürkheim germany its identification was based upon the bright blue lines in its spectrum and it was the first element discovered by spectrum analysis the first caesium metal was produced in 1882 by carl setterberg historically the most important use for caesium has been in research and development primarily in chemical and electrical applications
an alkali metal caesium occurs in lepidolite pollucite hydrated silicate of aluminium and caesium and within other sources one of the worlds most significant and rich sources of this metal is at bernic lake in manitoba the deposits there are estimated to contain 300000 metric tons of pollucite at an average of 20 caesium
it can be isolated by electrolysis of fused caesium cyanide and in a number of other ways exceptionally pure and gasfree caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition of caesium azide the primary compounds of caesium are caesium chloride and its nitrate the price of caesium metal in 1997 was about us30 per gram but its compounds are much cheaper see also caesium minerals
caesium has at least 39 known isotopes which is more than any other element except francium the atomic masses of these isotopes range from 112 to 151 even though this element has a large number of isotopes it has only one naturally occurring stable isotope 133cs most of the other isotopes have halflives from a few days to fractions of a second the radiogenic isotope sup137supcs has been used in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of sup3suph 137cs is produced from the detonation of nuclear weapons and is produced in nuclear power plants and was released to the atmosphere most notably from the 1986 chernobyl meltdown its because this isotope 137cs is one of the numerous products of fission directly issued from the fission of uranium
beginning in 1945 with the commencement of nuclear testing 137cs was released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed readily into solution and is returned to the surface of the earth as a component of radioactive fallout once 137cs enters the ground water it is deposited on soil surfaces and removed from the landscape primarily by particle transport as a result the input function of these isotopes can be estimated as a function of time caesium137 has a halflife of 3017 years it decomposes to barium137m a shortlived product of decay then to a form of nonradioactive barium
all alkali metals are highly reactive caesium being one of the heavier alkali metals is also one of the most reactive and is highly explosive when it comes in contact with water as the hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time causing ignition and a violent explosion the same as all alkali metals but caesium is so reactive this explosive reaction can even be triggered by cold water or ice caesium hydroxide is an extremely strong base and can etch glass
caesium compounds are encountered rarely by most persons all caesium compounds should be regarded as mildly toxic because of its chemical similarity to potassium large amounts cause hyperirritability and spasms but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources so cs is not a major chemical environmental pollutant rats fed caesium in place of potassium in their diet die so this element cannot replace potassium in function
the isotopes 134cs and 137cs present in the biosphere in small amounts as a result of radiation leaks represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products such as radioiodine and radiostrontium which are actively accumulated by the body

dysprosium is a rare earth element that has a metallic bright silver luster relatively stable in air at room temperature but dissolving readily in dilute or concentrated mineral acids with the emission of hydrogen it is soft enough to be cut with boltcutters but not with a knife and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided dysprosiums characteristics can be greatly affected even by small amounts of impurities
dysprosium is used in conjunction with vanadium and other elements in making laser materials its high thermal neutron absorption crosssection and melting point also suggests that it is useful for nuclear control rods dysprosium oxide also known as dysprosia with nickel cement compounds which absorb neutrons readily without swelling or contracting under prolonged neutron bombardment is used for cooling rods in nuclear reactors dysprosium cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation for studying chemical reactions furthermore dysprosium is used for manufacturing compact discs because it is highly paramagnetic dysprosium has been used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging
as a component of terfenold an alloy that expands or contracts to a high degree in the presence of a magnetic field dysprosium is of use in actuators sensors and other magenetomechanical devices
below 85k dysprosium is ferromagnetic with a high susceptibility it is often used for the fabrication of nanomagnets particularly in research its usefulness however is limited by its high readiness to oxidise
dysprosium was first identified in paris in 1886 by french chemist paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran however the element itself was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange and metallographic reduction techniques in the 1950s the name dysprosium is derived from the greek δυσπροσιτος dysprositos hard to obtain part of the difficulty lay in dysprosium being especially close in its behavior to the far more abundant yttrium during many of the separation technologies that were used in the 19th century this overshadowed the fact that dysprosium was the most abundant of the heavy lanthanides
dysprosium is never encountered as a free element but is found in many minerals including xenotime fergusonite gadolinite euxenite polycrase blomstrandine monazite and bastnasite often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements currently most dysprosium is being obtained from the ionadsorption clay ores of southern china in the highyttrium version of these dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy lanthanides comprising up to 78 of the concentrate as compared to about 65 for yttrium
nearly all dysprosium compounds are in the 3 oxidation state and are highly paramagnetic holmiumiii oxide ho2o3 and dysprosiumiii oxide dy2o3 are the most powerfully paramagnetic substances known

the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 164dy is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta minus decay the primary decay products before 164dy are terbium isotopes and the primary products after are holmium isotopes

dubnium named after dubna russia was reportedly first synthesized in 1967 at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia reportedly producing nuclide 260105 and nuclide 261105 by bombarding 243 am with 22 ne in late april 1970 researchers led by albert ghiorso working at the university of california berkeley had positively identified element 105
the american team synthesized the element by bombarding a target 249 cf with a beam of 84 mev nitrogen nuclei in the heavy ion linear accelerator a particle accelerator which produced nuclide 260105 with a halflife of 16 seconds atoms of element 105 were detected conclusively on march 5 1970 but there is evidence that this element had already been formed at berkeley a year earlier using the same method
the berkeley scientists later tried to confirm the soviet findings using more sophisticated methods but were not successful they proposed that the new element should be named hahnium symbol ha in honor of the late german scientist otto hahn consequently this was the name that most american and western european scientists used
an element naming controversy erupted over what to name this element after russian researchers protested the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac thus adopted unnilpentium symbol unp as a temporary systematic element name however in 1997 they resolved the dispute and adopted the current name dubnium symbol db after the city that contains the russian joint institute for nuclear research its former names have included hahnium joliotium and nielsbohrium symbol ns

europium is the most reactive of the rare earth elements it rapidly oxidizes in air and resembles calcium in its reaction with water deliveries of the metal element in solid form even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil are rarely shiny europium ignites in air at about 150 c to 180 c it is about as hard as lead and quite ductile
there are few commercial applications for europium metal although it has been used to dope some types of glass to make lasers as well as for screening for down syndrome and some other genetic diseases due to its ability to absorb neutrons it is also being studied for use in nuclear reactors europium oxide eu2o3 is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps and as an activator for yttrium based phosphors whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors divalent europium gives blue phosphors the two europium phosphor classes combined with the yellowgreen terbium phosphors give the trichromatic lights that are becoming so important to provide economical lighting it is also being used as an agent for the manufacture of fluorescent glass europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drugdiscovery screens it is also used in the anticounterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes
europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks rocks that cooled from magma or lava the nature of the europium anomaly found is used to help reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks
europium was first found by paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran in 1890 who obtained basic fraction from samarium gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium however the discovery of europium is generally credited to french chemist eugèneanatole demarçay who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate europium in 1901 when the europiumdoped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry there was a mad scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors typical europium content in monazite was about 005 luckily molycorp with its bastnäsite deposit at mountain pass california whose lanthanides had an unusually rich europium content of 01 was about to come online and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry prior to europium the colortv red phosphor was very weak and the other phosphor colors had to be muted to maintain color balance with the brilliant red europium phosphor it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors and a much brighter color tv picture was the result europium has continued in use in the tv industry ever since and of course also in computer monitors california bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from bayan obo china with an even richer europium content of 02 frank spedding celebrated for his development of the ionexchannge technology that revolutionized the rare earth industry in the mid1950s once related the story of how in the 1930s he was lecturing on the rare earths when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide this was an unheardof quantity at the time and spedding did not take the man seriously however a package duly arrived in the mail containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide the elderly gentleman had turned out to be the dr mccoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry
europium is never found in nature as a free element however there are many minerals containing europium with the most important sources being bastnäsite and monazite europium has also been identified in the spectra of the sun and certain stars depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as the europium anomaly
divalent europium in small amounts happens to be the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite calcium difluoride the most outstanding examples of this originated around weardale and adjacent parts of northern england and indeed it was this fluorite that gave its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence although it was not until much later that europium was discovered or determined to be the cause

naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 stable isotopes 151eu and 153eu with 153eu being the most abundant 522 natural abundance 35 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 150eu with a halflife of 369 years 152eu with a halflife of 13516 years and 154eu with a halflife of 8593 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 47612 years and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 122 seconds this element also has 8 meta states with the most stable being 150meu t 128 hours 152m1eu t 93116 hours and 152m2eu t 96 minutes
the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 153eu is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta minus decay the primary decay products before 153eu are isotopes of samarium sm and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium gd
europium is produced by nuclear fission but as it is near the top of the mass range for fission products the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low
like other lanthanides many isotopes especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutronpoor isotopes like 152eu have high cross sections for neutron capture often high enough to be neutron poisons
151eu is the beta decay product of sm151 but since this has a long decay halflife and short mean time to neutron absorption most 151sm instead winds up as 152sm
152eu halflife 13516 years and 154eu halflife 8593 years cannot be beta decay products because 152sm and 154sm are nonradioactive but 154eu is the only longlived shielded nuclide other than sup134supcs to have a fission yield of more than 25 parts per million fissions a larger amount of 154eu will be produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the nonradioactive153eu however much of this will be further converted to 155eu
sup155supeu halflife 47612 years has a fission yield of 330 ppm for u235 and thermal neutrons most will be transmuted to nonradioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium 156 by the end of fuel burnup
overall europium is overshadowed by cs137 and sr90 as a radiation hazard and by samarium and others as a neutron poison
the toxicity of europium compounds has not been fully investigated but there are no clear indications that europium is highly toxic compared to other heavy metals the metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard europium has no known biological role
europium metal is available commercially so it is not normally necessary to make it in the laboratory which is just as well as it is difficult to isolate as the pure metal this is largely because of the way it is found in nature the lanthanoids are found in nature in a number of minerals the most important are xenotime monazite and bastnaesite the first two are orthophosphate minerals lnpo4 ln deonotes a mixture of all the lanthanoids except promethium which is vanishingly rare and the third is a fluoride carbonate lnco3f lanthanoids with even atomic numbers are more common the most comon lanthanoids in these minerals are in order cerium lanthanum neodymium and praseodymium monazite also contains thorium and ytrrium which makes handling difficult since thorium and its decomposition products are radioactive
for many purposes it is not particularly necessary to separate the metals but if separation into individual metals is required the process is complex initially the metals are extracted as salts from the ores by extraction with sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh modern purification techniques for these lanthanoid salt mixtures are ingenious and involve selective complexation techniques solvent extractions and ion exchange chromatography
pure europium is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten eucl3 and nacl or cacl2 in a graphite cell which acts as cathode using graphite as anode the other product is chlorine gas

erbium for ytterby a town in sweden was discovered by carl gustaf mosander in 1843 mosander separated yttria from the mineral gadolinite into three fractions which he called yttria erbia and terbia he named the new element after the town of ytterby where large concentrations of yttria and erbium are located erbia and terbia however were confused at this time after 1860 terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia fairly pure er2 o 3 was independently isolated in 1905 by georges urbain and charles james reasonably pure metal wasnt produced until 1934 when workers reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor
like other rare earths this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in monazite sand ores it has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ionexchange production techniques developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rareearth metals and their chemical compounds the principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals xenotime and euxenite and most recently the ion adsorption clays of southern china in the highyttrium versions of these ore concentrates yttrium is about twothirds of the total by weight and erbia is about 45 this is enough erbium to impart a distinct pink color to the solution when the concentrate is dissolved in acid this color behavior is highly similar to what mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from ytterby gadolinite

like many of the synthetic elements many of einsteiniums isotopes are radioactive
einsteinium does not occur naturally in any measurable quantities the modern process of creating the element starts with the irradiation of plutonium239 in a nuclear reactor for several years the resulting plutonium242 isotope in the form of the compound plutoniumiv oxide is mixed with aluminum and formed into pellets the pellets are then further irradiated for approximately one year in a nuclear reactor another four months of irradition is required in a different reactor the result is a mixture of californium and einsteinium which can then be separated
aside from being the byproduct of creating other elements or a step in the production of other elements einsteinium has no known uses
einsteinium was first identified in december 1952 by albert ghiorso at the university of california berkeley he was examining debris from the first hydrogen bomb test of november 1952 see operation ivy he discovered the isotope 253es halflife 205 days that was made by the nuclear fusion of 15 neutrons with 238 u which then went through seven beta decays these findings were kept secret until 1955 due to cold war tensions
in 1961 enough einsteinium was synthesized to prepare a microscopic amount of 253es this sample weighed about 001 mg and was measured using a special balance the material produced was used to produce mendelevium further einsteinium has been produced at the oak ridge national laboratory s high flux isotope reactor in tennessee by bombarding 239 pu with neutrons around 3 milligrams were created over a four year program of irradiation and then chemical separation from a starting 1 kg of plutonium isotope
nineteen radioisotopes of einsteinium have been characterized with the most stable being 252es with a halflife of 4717 days 254es with a halflife of 2757 days 255es with a halflife of 398 days and 253es with a halflife of 2047 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 40 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 30 minutes this element also has three meta states with the most stable being 254mes t 393 hours the isotopes of einsteinium range in atomic mass from 240069 u 240es to 258100 u 258es the most original isotope is the 252es
the following is a list of all known compounds of einsteinium

fluorines large electronegativity and small atomic radius gives it interesting bonding characteristics particularly in conjunction with carbon see covalent radius of fluorine
pure fluorine f2 is a corrosive pale yellow or brown gas that is a powerful oxidizing agent it is the most reactive and most electronegative of all the elements 40 and readily forms compounds with most other elements it has an oxidation number 1 except when bonded to another fluorine in f2 which gives it an oxidation number of 0 fluorine even combines with argon krypton xenon and radon even in dark cool conditions fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen it is so reactive that metals and even water as well as other substances burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas it is far too reactive to be found in elemental form in moist air it reacts with water to form alsodangerous hydrofluoric acid
in aqueous solution fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion f although highly diluted hf is such a weak acid that substantial amounts of it are present in any water solution of fluoride at near neutral ph other forms are fluoro complexes such as fef4 or h2f
fluorides are compounds that combine fluorine with some positively charged counterpart they often consist of crystalline ionic salts fluorine compounds with metals are among the most stable of salts
chemical uses atomic fluorine and molecular fluorine are used for plasma etching in semiconductor manufacturing flat panel display production and mems microelectromechanical systems fabrication xenon difluoride is also used for this last purpose hydrofluoric acid chemical formula hf is used to etch glass in light bulbs and other products fluorine is indirectly used in the production of low friction plastics such as teflon and in halons such as freon along with some of its compounds fluorine is used in the production of pure uranium from uranium hexafluoride and in the synthesis of numerous commercial fluorochemicals including vitally important pharmaceuticals agrochemical compounds lubricants and textiles fluorochlorohydrocarbons are used extensively in air conditioning and in refrigeration chlorofluorocarbons have been banned for these applications because they contribute to ozone destruction and the ozone hole interestingly since it is chlorine and bromine radicals which harm the ozone layer not fluorine compounds which do not contain chlorine or bromine but contain only fluorine carbon and hydrogen called hydrofluorocarbons are not on the epa list of ozonedepleting substances and have been widely used as replacements for the chlorine and brominecontaining fluorocarbons hydrofluorocarbons do have a greenhouse effect but a small one compared with carbon dioxide and methane sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely inert and nontoxic gas very useful as an insulator in highvoltage electrical equipment it does not occur in nature so it is a useful tracer gas though as an exceptionally potent greenhouse gas its use in unenclosed systems is inadvisable sodium hexafluoro aluminate cryolite is used in the electrolysis of aluminium in much higher concentrations sodium fluoride has been used as an insecticide especially against cockroaches fluorides have been used in the past to help molten metal flow hence the name some researchers including us space scientists in the early 1960s have studied elemental fluorine gas as a possible rocket propellant due to its exceptionally high specific impulse the experiments failed because fluorine proved difficult to handle and its combustion products proved extremely toxic and corrosive polytetrafluoroethylene also known as the nonstick teflon surface in baking pans compounds of fluorine such as fluoropolymers potassium fluoride and cryolite are utilized in applications such as anti reflective coatings and dichroic mirrors on account of their unusually low refractive index
dental and medical uses compounds of fluorine including sodium fluoride naf stannous fluoride snf2 and sodium mfp are used in toothpaste to prevent dental cavities these compounds are also added to municipal water supplies a process called water fluoridation though a number of health concerns has sometimes led to controversy many important agents for general anesthesia such as sevoflurane desflurane and isoflurane are hydrofluorocarbon derivatives the fluorinated antiinflammatories dexamethasone and triamcinolone are among the most potent of the synthetic corticosteroids class of drugs fludrocortisone florinef is one of the most common mineralocorticoids a class of drugs which mimics the actions of aldosterone fluconazole is a triazole antifungal drug used in the treatment and prevention of superficial and systemic fungal infections fluoroquinolones are a family of broadspectrum antibiotics ssri antidepressants except in a few instances are fluorinated molecules these include citalopram escitalopram oxalate fluoxetine fluvoxamine maleate and paroxetine a notable exception is sertraline because of the difficulty of biological systems in dealing with metabolism of fluorinated molecules fluorinated antibiotics and antidepressants are among the major fluorinated organics found in treated city sewage and wastewater
sup18supf a radioactive isotope that emits positrons is often used in positron emission tomography because its halflife of 110 minutes is long by the standards of positronemitters
fluorine forms a variety of very different compounds owing to its small atomic size and covalent behavior and on the other hand its oxidizing ability and extreme electronegativity for example hydrofluoric acid is extremely dangerous while in synthetic drugs incorporating an aromatic ring eg flumazenil fluorine is used to prevent toxication or to delay metabolism
the fluoride ion is basic therefore hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid in water solution however water is not an inert solvent in this case when less basic solvents such as anhydrous acetic acid are used hydrofluoric acid is the strongest of the hydrohalogenic acids also owing to the basicity of the fluoride ion soluble fluorides give basic water solutions the fluoride ion is a lewis base and has a high affinity to certain elements such as calcium and silicon for example deprotection of silicon protecting groups is achieved with a fluoride the fluoride ion is poisonous
fluorine as a freely reacting oxidant gives the strongest oxidants known chlorine trifluoride for example can burn water and sand both compounds of a weaker oxidant oxygen
fluorine compounds involving noble gases were first synthesised by neil bartlett in 1962xenon hexafluoroplatinate xeptf6 being the first fluorides of krypton and radon have also been prepared also argon fluorohydride has been prepared although it is only stable at cryogenic temperatures
the carbonfluoride bond is covalent and very stable the use of a fluorocarbon polymer polytetrafluoroethene or teflon is an example it is thermostable and waterproof enough to be used in frying pans organofluorines may be safely used in applications such as drugs without the risk of release of toxic fluoride in synthetic drugs toxication can be prevented for example an aromatic ring is useful but presents a safety problem enzymes in the body metabolize some of them into poisonous epoxides when the para position is substituted with fluorine the aromatic ring is protected and epoxide is no longer produced fluorine can often be substituted for hydrogen when it occurs in organic compounds through this mechanism fluorine can have a very large number of compounds
this element is recovered from fluorite cryolite and fluorapatite

fluorine in the form of fluorspar also called fluorite calcium fluoride was described in 1530 by georgius agricola for its use as a flux which is a substance that is used to promote the fusion of metals or minerals in 1670 schwanhard found that glass was etched when it was exposed to fluorspar that was treated with acid carl wilhelm scheele and many later researchers including humphry davy caroline menard gaylussac antoine lavoisier and louis thenard all would experiment with hydrofluoric acid easily obtained by treating calcium fluoride fluorspar with concentrated sulfuric acid
it was eventually realized that hydrofluoric acid contained a previously unknown element this element was not isolated for many years after this due to its extreme reactivity fluorine can only be prepared from its compounds electrolytically and then it immediately attacks any susceptible materials in the area finally in 1886 elemental fluorine was isolated by henri moissan after almost 74 years of continuous effort by other chemists it was an effort which cost several researchers their health or even their lives the derivation of elemental fluorine from hydrofluoric acid is exceptionally dangerous killing or blinding several scientists who attempted early experiments on this halogen these men came to be referred to as fluorine martyrs for moissan it earned him the 1906 nobel prize in chemistry moissan himself lived to be 54 and it is not clear whether his fluorine work shortened his life
the first largescale production of fluorine was needed for the atomic bomb manhattan project in world war ii where the compound uranium hexafluoride uf6 was needed as a gaseous carrier of uranium to separate the 235u and 238u isotopes of uranium today both the gaseous diffusion process and the gas centrifuge process use gaseous uf6 to produce enriched uranium for nuclear power applications in the manhattan project it was found that elemental fluorine was present whenever uf6 was due to the spontaneous decomposition of this compound into uf4 and f2 the corrosion problem due to the f2 was eventually solved by electrolytically coating all uf6 carrying piping with nickel metal which resists fluorines attack joints and flexible parts were made from teflon then a very recently discovered fluorocarbon plastic which was not attacked by f2
elemental fluorine is prepared industrially by moissan s original process electrolysis of anhydrous hf in which khf2 has been dissolved to provide enough ions for conduction to take place
in 1986 when preparing for a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of fluorine karl christe discovered a purely chemical preparation by reacting together at 150 c solutions in anhydrous hf of k2mnf6 and of sbfsub5sub the reaction is f6 2 f5 2 f6 f3 frac12f2 this is not a practical synthesis but demonstrates that electrolysis is not essential
both elemental fluorine and fluoride ions are highly toxic and must be handled with great care and any contact with skin and eyes should be strictly avoided when it is a free element fluorine has a characteristic pungent odor that is detectable in concentrations as low as 20 nll all equipment must be passivated before exposure to fluorine
contact of exposed skin with hydrofluoric acid solutions poses one of the most extreme and insidious industrial threatsone which is exacerbated by the fact that hydrofluoric acid damages nerves in such a way as to make such burns initially painless the hydrofluoric acid molecule is capable of rapidly migrating through lipid layers of cells which would ordinarily stop an ionized acid and the burns are typically deep hf may react with calcium permanently damaging the bone more seriously reaction with the bodys calcium can cause cardiac arrhythmias followed by cardiac arrest brought on by sudden chemical changes within the body these cannot always be prevented with local or intravenous injection of calcium salts hydrofluoric acid spills over just 25 of the bodys surface area about 75 in2 or 5 dm2 despite copious immediate washing have been fatal if the patient survives hydrofluoric acid burns typically produce open wounds of an especially slowhealing nature
elemental fluorine is a powerful oxidizer which can cause organic material combustibles or other flammable materials to ignite
fluorocarbons are generally inert and nontoxic the electronegativity of fluorine means that a nearby fluorine atom makes a carboxylic acid group very much more reactive for example trifluoroacetic acid is 100000 times stronger than acetic acid

francium was discovered by marguerite perey in france from which the element takes its name in 1939 it was the last element discovered in nature rather than synthesized outside the laboratory francium is extremely rare with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores where the isotope francium223 continually forms and decays as little as 30nbspg one ounce exists at any given time throughout the earth s crust the other isotopes are entirely synthetic the largest amount ever collected of any isotope was a cluster of 10000 atoms of francium210 created as an ultracold gas at stony brook in 1997
francium is less stable than any other element lighter than nobelium element 102
francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties most resemble those of caesium it has the highest equivalent weight of any element caesium has the secondlowest at 079 liquid francium if such a substance were to be created should have a surface tension of 005092nbsp n m at its melting point francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts such as caesium perchlorate which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate this coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of glendenin and nelson it will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts including the iodate the picrate the tartrate also rubidium tartrate the chloroplatinate and the silicotungstate it also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid and with perchloric acid without another alkali metal as a carrier which provides other methods of separation nearly all francium salts are watersoluble
due to its instability and rarity
franciums ability to be synthesized trapped and cooled along with its relatively simple atomic structure have made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments these experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by lasertrapped francium210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory
as early as 1870 chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium with an atomic number of 87 research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made
russian chemist d k dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found ekacaesium or francium in 1925 he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium another alkali metal and concluded that ekacaesium was contaminating the sample he then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of ekacaesium in which he named the element russium after his home country shortly thereafter dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the polytechnic institute of odessa and he did not pursue the element further
the following year english chemists gerald j f druce and frederick h loring analyzed xray photographs of manganeseii sulfate
in 1930 fred allison of the alabama polytechnic institute claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magnetooptical machine allison requested that it be named virginium after his home state of virginia along with the symbols vi and vm in 1934 however hg macpherson of uc berkeley disproved the effectiveness of allisons device and the validity of this false discovery
in 1936 romanian chemist horia hulubei and his french colleague yvette cauchois also analyzed pollucite this time using their highresolution xray apparatus
ekacaesium was truly discovered in 1939 by marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris france when she purified a sample of actinium 227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220nbspkev however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80nbspkev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one which was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium227 various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element 87 caused by the alpha decay of actinium227
perey named the new isotope actiniumk now referred to as francium223 francium was the last naturally occurring element to be discovered following rhenium in 1925
francium223 is the result of the alpha decay of actinium227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals this makes it the second rarest element in the crust after astatine
francium can be synthesized in the nuclear reaction 197au 18o 210fr 5n this process developed by stony brook physics yields francium isotopes with masses of 209 210 and 211 which are then isolated by the magnetooptic trap mot other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons and bombarding thorium with protons deuterons or helium ions francium has not yet as of 2006 been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh
there are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 199 to 232 francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers
francium223 is the most stable isotope with a halflife of 218nbspminutes francium223 then decays into radium223 by beta decay 1149nbspkev decay energy with a minor 0006 alpha decay path to astatine219 54nbspmev decay energy
francium221 has a halflife of 48nbspminutes

webelementscom francium los alamos national laboratory francium stony brook university physics dept fermium is a synthetic element with the symbol fm and atomic number 100 a highly radioactive metallic transuranic element of the actinide series fermium is made by bombarding plutonium with neutrons and is named after nuclear physicist enrico fermi
only small amounts of fermium have ever been produced or isolated thus relatively little is known about its chemical properties only the iii oxidation state of the element appears to exist in aqueous solution 254fm and heavier isotopes can be synthesized by intense neutron bombardment of lighter elements especially uranium and plutonium during this successive neutron captures mixed with beta decays build the fermium isotope the intense neutron bombardment conditions needed to create fermium exist in thermonuclear explosions and can be replicated in the laboratory such as in the high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory the synthesis of element 102 nobelium was confirmed when 250fm was chemically identified there are no known uses of fermium outside of basic research fermium is the eighth transuranic element
fermium after enrico fermi was first discovered by a team led by albert ghiorso in 1952 the team found 255fm in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion see operation ivy that isotope was created when 238u combined with 17 neutrons in the intense temperature and pressure of the explosion eight beta decays also occurred to create the element the work was overseen by the university of california radiation laboratory argonne national laboratory and los alamos scientific laboratory whose team members included ghiorso stanley g thompson gary h higgins glenn t seaborg from the radiation laboratory and department of chemistry of the university of california martin h studier pr fields sherman m fried h diamond jf mech gl pyle john r huizenga a hirsch wm manning from the argonne national laboratory ci browne h louise smith and rw spence from the los alamos scientific laboratory samples of sea coral impacted from the first thermonuclear explosion of november 1952 were used
all these findings were kept secret until 1955 due to cold war tensions however in late 1953 and early 1954 a team from the nobel institute of physics in stockholm bombarded a 238 u target with 16 o ions producing an alphaemitter with an atomic weight of 250 and with 100 protons in other words element 250100 the nobel team did not claim discovery but the isotope they produced was later positively identified as 250fm
17 radioisotopes of fermium have been characterized with the most stable being 257fm with a halflife of 1005 days 253fm with a halflife of 3 days 252fm with a halflife of 2539 hours and 255fm with a halflife of 2007 hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 54 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 3 minutes this element also has 1 meta state 250mfm t 18 seconds the isotopes of fermium range in atomic weight from 242073 u 242fm to 259101 u 259fm

gold formed the basis for the gold standard used before the fiat currency monetary system was employed by the international monetary fund imf and the bank for international settlements bis it is specifically against imf regulations to base any currency against gold for all imf member states however currencies may be based on oil though such as the opec petrodollar the iso currency code of gold bullion is xau
modern industrial uses include dentistry and electronics where gold has traditionally found use because of its good resistance to oxidative corrosion
chemically gold is a trivalent and univalent transition metal gold does not react with most chemicals but is attacked by chlorine fluorine aqua regia and cyanide gold dissolves in mercury forming amalgam alloys but does not react with it gold is insoluble in nitric acid which will dissolve silver and base metals and this is the basis of the gold refining technique known as inquartation and parting nitric acid has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items and this is the origin of the colloquial term acid test referring to a gold standard test for genuine value
gold is the most malleable and ductile metal a single gram can be beaten into a sheet of one square meter or an ounce into 300 square feet gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become translucent the transmitted light appears greenish blue because gold strongly reflects yellow and red gold readily forms alloys with many other metals these alloys can be produced to increase the hardness or to create exotic colors see below native gold contains usually eight to ten percent silver but often much more mdash alloys with a silver content over 20 are called electrum as the amount of silver increases the color becomes whiter and the specific gravity becomes lower
gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity and is not affected by air and most reagents heat moisture oxygen and most corrosive agents have very little chemical effect on gold making it wellsuited for use in coins and jewelry conversely halogens will chemically alter gold and aqua regia dissolves it via formation of the chloraurate ion
common oxidation states of gold include 1 goldi or aurous compounds and 3 goldiii or auric compounds gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated out as gold metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent the added metal is oxidized and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate
recent research undertaken by sir frank reith of the australian national university shows that microbes play an important role in forming gold deposits transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits
high quality pure metallic gold is tasteless in keeping with its resistance to corrosion it is metal ions which confer taste to metals
in addition gold is very dense a cubic meter weighing 19300 kg by comparison the density of lead is 11340 kgm and the densest element iridium is 22650 kgm
in various countries gold is used as a standard for monetary exchange in coinage and in jewelry pure gold is too soft for ordinary use and is typically hardened by alloying with copper or other base metals the gold content of gold alloys is measured in carats k pure gold being designated as 24k
gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 into the 1930s were typically a standard 22k alloy called crown gold for hardness modern collectorinvestment bullion coins which do not require good mechanical wear properties are typically 24k although the american gold eagle and british gold sovereign continue to be made at 22k on historical tradition the canadian gold maple leaf coin contains the highest purity gold of any popular bullion coin at 99999 99999 fine several other 9999 pure gold coins are currently available including australias gold kangaroos first appearing in 1986 as the australian gold nugget with the kangaroo theme appearing in 1989 the several coins of the australian lunar calendar series and the austrian philharmonic in 2006 the us mint began production of the american buffalo gold bullion coin also at 9999 purity

in medieval times gold was often seen as beneficial for the health in the belief that something that rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power some gold salts do have antiinflammatory properties and are used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions however only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value as elemental metallic gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body gold leaf flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foodstuffs notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient gold flake was used by the nobility in medieval europe as a decoration in foodstuffs and drinks in the form of leafs flakes or dust either to demonstrate the hosts wealth or in the belief that something that valuable and rare must be beneficial for ones health gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by hightemperature hard soldering or brazing if the work is to be of hallmarking quality gold solder must match the carat weight of the work and alloy formulae are manufactured in most industrystandard carat weights to color match yellow and white gold gold solder is usually made in at least three meltingpoint ranges referred to as easy medium and hard by using the hard highmelting point solder first followed by solders with progressively lower melting points goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints gold can be used in food and has the e number 175 goldwasser german goldwater is a traditional herbal liqueur produced in gdańsk poland and schwabach germany and contains flakes of gold leaf there are also some expensive 1000 cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf however since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry it adds no taste nor has it any other nutritional effect and leaves the body unaltered dentistry gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry especially in tooth restorations such as crowns and permanent bridges the gold alloys slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns the use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others gold can be made into thread and used in embroidery gold is ductile and malleable meaning it can be drawn into very thin wire and can be beaten into very

high energy applications silver is even more conductive per volume but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance for example gold electrical wires were used during some of the manhattan project s atomic experiments but large high current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project though gold is attacked by free chlorine its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments including resistance to nonchlorinated acids has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin layer coating electrical connectors of all kinds thereby ensuring good connection for example gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables such as audio video and usb cables the benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications is highly debated gold connectors are often criticized by audiovisual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy however the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost certain computers communications equipment spacecraft jet aircraft engines remains very common and is unlikely to be replaced in the near future by any other metal besides sliding electrical contacts gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity ductility and lack of toxicity switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts colloidal gold colloidal sols of gold nanoparticles in water are intensely red colored and can be made with tightlycontrolled particle sizes up to a few tens of nm across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine biology and materials science the technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells faulk and taylor 1979 in ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen roth et al 1980 colloidal gold is also the form of gold used as gold paint on ceramics prior to firing gold or alloys of gold and palladium are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other nonconducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope the coating which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma has a triple role in this application golds very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the sems electron beam helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen this improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam and these lowenergy electrons are the most commonlyused signal source used in the scanning electron microscope many competitions and honors such as the olympics and the nobel prize award a gold medal to the winner as gold is a good reflector of both infrared and visible light it is used for

gold has been known and highlyvalued since prehistoric times it may have been the first metal used by humans and was valued for ornamentation and rituals egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as 2600 bc describe gold which king tushratta of the mitanni claimed was more plentiful than dirt in egypt egypt and nubia had the resources to make them major goldproducing areas for much of history gold is also mentioned frequently in the old testament starting with genesis 211 at havilah and is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of matthew new testament the book of revelation 2121 describes the city of new jerusalem as having streets made of pure gold clear as crystal the southeast corner of the black sea was famed for its gold exploitation is said to date from the time of midas and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the worlds earliest coinage in lydia between 643 and 630 bc
the mali empire in africa was famed throughout the old world for its large amounts of gold mansa musa ruler of the empire 13121337 became famous throughout the old world for his great hajj to mecca in 1324 when he passed through cairo in july of 1324 he was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels he gave away so much gold that it took over a decade for the economy across north africa to recover due to the rapid inflation that it initiated a contemporary arab historian remarked
the european exploration of the americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by native american peoples especially in central america peru and colombia
although the price of some platinum group metals can be much higher gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies known as the gold standard in history gold has been used as a symbol for purity value royalty and particularly roles that combine these properties gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was made fun of by thomas more in his treatise utopia on that imaginary island gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves tableware and lavatoryseats when ambassadors from other countries arrive dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges the utopians mistake them for menial servants paying homage instead to the most modestlydressed of their party
there is an ageold tradition of biting gold in order to test its authenticity although this is certainly not a professional way of examining gold the bite test should score the gold because gold is considered a soft metal according to the mohs scale of mineral hardness the purer the gold the easier it should be to mark it painted lead can cheat this test because lead is softer than gold and may invite a small risk of lead poisoning if sufficient lead is absorbed by the biting
gold in antiquity was relatively easy to obtain geologically however 75 of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910 it has been estimated that all the gold in the world that has ever been refined would form a single cube 20 m 66 ft on a side equivalent to 8000 m
one main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances such as lead mdash presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosophers stone although they never succeeded in this attempt the alchemists promoted an interest in what can be done with substances and this laid a foundation for todays chemistry their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center which was also the astrological symbol the egyptian hieroglyph and the ancient chinese character for the sun for modern attempts to produce artificial gold see gold synthesis
during the 19th century gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered the first major gold strike in the united states occurred in a small north georgia town called dahlonega further gold rushes occurred in california colorado otago australia witwatersrand black hills and klondike
because of its historically high value much of the gold mined throughout history is still in circulation in one form or another
economic gold extraction can be achieved from ore grades as little as 05 g1000 kg 05 parts per million ppm on average in large easily mined deposits typical ore grades in openpit mines are 15 g1000 kg 15 ppm ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least 3 g1000 kg 3 ppm on average since ore grades of 30 g1000 kg 30 ppm are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye in most gold mines the gold is invisible
since the 1880s south africa has been the source for a large proportion of the worlds gold supply with about 50 of all gold ever produced having come from south africa production in 1970 accounted for 79 of the world supply producing about 1000 tonnes however by 2005 production was just 294 tonnes according to the british geological survey this sharp decline was due to the increasing difficulty of extraction and changing economic factors affecting the industry in south africa
the city of johannesburg located in south africa was founded as a result of the witwatersrand gold rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest gold deposits the world has ever seen gold fields located within the basin in the free state and gauteng provinces are extensive in strike and dip requiring some of the worlds deepest mines with the savuka and tautona mines being currently the worlds deepest gold mine at 3777nbspm the second boer war of 1899ndash1901 between the british empire and the afrikaner boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in south africa
other major producers are united states australia china russia and peru mines in south dakota and nevada supply twothirds of gold used in the united states in south america the controversial project pascua lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of atacama desert at the border between chile and argentina today about onequarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining
after initial production gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the wohlwill process or the miller process other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cuppelation or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia
the worlds oceans hold a vast amount of gold but in very low concentrations perhaps 12 parts per 10 billion a number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water but so far they have all been either mistaken or crooks reverend prescott jernegan ran a goldfrom seawater swindle in america in the 1890s a british fraud ran the same scam in england in the early 1900s
fritz haber the german inventor of the haber process attempted commercial extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay germanys reparations following the first world war unfortunately his assessment of the concentration of gold in sea water was unduly high probably due to sample contamination the effort produced little gold and cost the german government far more than the commercial value of the gold recovered no commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future
the average gold mining and extraction costs are 238 per troy ounce but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality in 2001 global mine production amounted to 2604 tonnes or 67 of total gold demand in that year at the end of 2001 it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totalled 145000 tonnes
at current consumption rates the supply of gold is believed to last 45 years
like other precious metals gold is measured by troy weight and by grams when it is alloyed with other metals the term carat or karat is used to indicate the amount of gold present with 24 karats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less the purity of a gold bar can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1 known as the millesimal fineness such as 0995 being very pure
the price of gold is determined on the open market but a procedure known as the gold fixing in london originating in september 1919 provides a daily benchmark figure to the industry the afternoon fixing appeared in 1968 to fix a price when us markets are open
the high price of gold is due to its rare amount only three parts out of every billion 0000000003 in the earths crust is gold historically gold was used to back currency in an economic system known as the gold standard a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency for a long period the united states government set the value of the us dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to 2067 66456kg but in 1934 the dollar was revalued to 3500 per troy ounce 112527kg by 1961 it was becoming hard to maintain this price and a pool of us and european banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand
on 17 march 1968 economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool and a twotiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old 3500 per troy ounce 113g but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate this twotiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its freemarket level central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining the largest gold depository in the world is that of the us federal reserve bank in new york which holds about 3 of the gold ever mined as does the similarlyladen us bullion depository at fort knox
in 2005 the world gold council estimated total global gold supply to be 3859 tonnes and demand to be 3754 tonnes giving a surplus of 105 tonnes
since 1968 the price of gold on the open market has ranged widely from a high of 850oz 27300kg on 21 january 1980 to a low of 25290oz 8131kg on 21 june 1999 london gold fixing the 1980 high was not overtaken until 3 january 2008 when a new record of 86535 per troy ounce was set in the am london gold fixing
although gold is a noble metal it forms many and diverse compounds the oxidation state of gold in its compound ranges from 1 to 5 but aui and auiii dominate goldi referred to as the aurous ion is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers thiolates and tertiary phosphines aui compounds are typically linear a good example is aucn2ndash which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining curiously aurous complexes of water are rare the binary gold halides such as aucl form zigzag polymeric chains again featuring linear coordination at au most drugs based on gold are aui derivatives
goldiii auric is a common oxidation state and is illustrated by goldiii chloride au cl 3 its derivative is chloroauric acid haucl4 which forms when au dissolves in aqua regia auiii complexes like other d8 compounds are typically square planar
compounds containing the au anion are called aurides caesium auride csau which crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif other aurides include those of rb k and tetramethylammonium ch34n goldii compounds are usually diamagnetic with auau bonds such as auch22pc6h52 2cl2 a noteworthy legitimate auii complex contains xenon as a ligand auxe4 sb2f112 gold pentafluoride is the sole example of auv the highest verified oxidation state
some gold compounds exhibit aurophilic bonding which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional auau bond but shorter that van der waals bonding the interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a hydrogen bond
welldefined cluster compounds are numerous
there is one stable isotope of gold and 18 radioisotopes with 195au being the most stable with a halflife of 186 days
gold has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt is another betterknown salting material a jacket of natural gold irradiated by the intense highenergy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon would transmute into the radioactive isotope au198 with a halflife of 2697 days and produce approximately 411 mev of gamma radiation significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapons fallout for several days such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used
gold has been associated with the extremities of utmost evil and great sanctity throughout history in the book of exodus the golden calf is a symbol of idolatry and rebellion against god in communist propaganda the golden pocket watch and its fastening golden chain were the characteristic accessories of the class enemy the bourgeois and the industrial tycoons credit card companies associate their product with wealth by naming and coloring their topoftherange cards gold although in an attempt to outdo each other platinum and the evenmoreelite black card has now overtaken gold
on the other hand in the book of genesis abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver and moses was instructed to cover the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant with pure gold eminent orators such as john chrysostom were said to have a mouth of gold with a silver tongue gold is associated with notable anniversaries particularly in a 50year cycle such as a golden wedding anniversary golden jubilee etc
great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold in the form of medals and decorations winners of races and prizes are usually awarded the gold medal such as the olympic games and the nobel prize while many award statues are depicted in gold such as the academy awards the golden globe awards the emmy awards the palme dor and the british academy film awards
medieval kings were inaugurated under the signs of sacred oil and a golden crown the latter symbolizing the eternal shining light of heaven and thus a christian kings divinely inspired authority wedding rings are traditionally made of gold since it is longlasting and unaffected by the passage of time it is considered a suitable material for everyday wear as well as a metaphor for the relationship in orthodox christianity the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown during the ceremony an amalgamation of symbolic rites
the symbolic value of gold varies greatly around the world even within geographic regions for example gold is quite common in turkey but considered a most valuable gift in sicily
pure gold is nontoxic and nonirritating when ingested and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf it is also a component of the alcoholic drinks goldschläger gold strike and goldwasser gold is approved as a food additive in the eu e175 in the codex alimentarius
soluble compounds gold salts such as potassium gold cyanide used in gold electroplating are toxic to the liver and kidneys there are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelating agents such as british antilewisite

getting gold 1898 book technical document on extraction and mining of gold gallium is a chemical element that has the symbol ga and atomic number 31 a soft silvery metallic poor metal gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures but liquefies slightly above room temperature and will melt in the hand it occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores an important application is in the compounds gallium nitride and gallium arsenide used as a semiconductor most notably in lightemitting diodes leds
elemental gallium is not found in nature but it is easily obtained by smelting very pure gallium metal has a brilliant silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass gallium metal expands by 31 percent when it solidifies and therefore storage in either glass or metal containers is avoided due to the possibility of container rupture with freezing gallium shares the higherdensity liquid state with only a few materials like germanium bismuth antimony and water
gallium also attacks most other metals by diffusing into their metal lattice gallium for example diffuses into the grain boundaries of al zn alloys or steel making them very brittle also gallium metal easily alloys with many metals and was used in small quantities in the core of the first atomic bomb to help stabilize the plutonium crystal structure
the melting point temperature of 30c allows the metal to be melted in ones hand this metal has a strong tendency to supercool below its melting point freezing point thus necessitating seeding in order to solidify gallium is one of the metals with caesium rubidium francium and mercury which are liquid at or near normal room temperature and can therefore be used in metalinglass hightemperature thermometers it is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal and unlike mercury for having a low vapor pressure at high temperatures unlike mercury liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions for this reason as well as the metal contamination problem and freezingexpansion problems noted above samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers
gallium does not crystallize in any of the simple crystal structures the stable phase under normal conditions is orthorhombic with 8 atoms in the conventional unit cell each atom has only one nearest neighbor at a distance of 244 pm and six other neighbors within additional 39 pm many stable and metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure
the bonding between the nearest neighbors is found to be of covalent character hence ga2 dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal the compound with arsenic gallium arsenide is a semiconductor commonly used in lightemitting diodes
highpurity gallium is attacked slowly by mineral acids
gallium the latin gallia means gaul essentially modern france and the latin gallus means rooster was discovered spectroscopically by lecoq de boisbaudran in 1875 by its characteristic spectrum two violet lines in an examination of a zinc blende from the pyrenees before its discovery most of its properties had been predicted and described by dmitri mendeleev who had called the hypothetical element ekaaluminium on the basis of its position in his periodic table later in 1875 boisbaudran obtained the free metal by electrolysis of its hydroxide in potassium hydroxide solution he named the element gallia after his native land of france it was later claimed that in one of those multilingual puns so beloved of men of science in the early 19th century he had also named gallium after himself as his name lecoq is the french for the rooster and the latin for rooster is gallus however in an 1877 article lecoq denied this supposition
gallium does not exist in free form in nature nor do any highgallium minerals exist to serve as a primary source of extraction of the element or its compounds gallium is found and extracted as a trace component in bauxite coal diaspore germanite and sphalerite the united states geological survey usgc estimates gallium reserves based on 50 ppm by weight concentration in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores some flue dusts from burning coal have been shown to contain small quantities of gallium typically less than 1 by weight
most gallium is extracted from the crude aluminium hydroxide solution of the bayer process for producing alumina and aluminum a mercury cell electrolysis and hydrolysis of the amalgam with sodium hydroxide leads to sodium gallate electrolysis then gives gallium metal for semiconductor use further purification is carried out using zone melting or else single crystal extraction from a melt czochralski process purities of 999999 are routinely achieved and commercially widely available
the current price for 1 gram gallium of 999999 purity seems to be at about us 1500
semiconductor and electronic industry the semiconductor applications are the main reason for the lowcost commercial availability of the extremely highpurity 999999 metal as a component of the semiconductor gallium arsenide the most common application for gallium is analog integrated circuits with the second largest use being optoelectronic devices mostly laser diodes and lightemitting diodes gallium is used widely as a dopant to dope semiconductors and produce solidstate devices like transistors gallium is the rarest component of new photovoltaic compounds such as copper indium gallium selenium sulphide or cuingases2 recently announced by south african researchers for use in solar panels as an alternative to crystalline silicon which is currently in short supply
as a wetting and alloy improvement agent because gallium wets glass or porcelain gallium can be used to create brilliant mirrors gallium readily alloys with most metals and has been used as a component in lowmelting alloys the plutonium used in nuclear weapon pits is machined by alloying with gallium to stabilize the allotropes of plutonium gallium added in quantities up to 2 in common solders can aid wetting and flow characteristics
as part of an energy storage mechanism aluminium is reactive enough to reduce water to hydrogen being oxidized to aluminium oxide however the aluminium oxide forms a protective coat which prevents further reaction when gallium is alloyed with aluminium the coat does not form thus the alloy can potentially provide a solid hydrogen source for transportation purposes which would be more convenient than a pressurized hydrogen tank resmelting the resultant aluminum oxide and gallium mixture to metallic aluminum and gallium and reforming these into electrodes would constitute most of the energy input into the system while electricity produced by a hydrogen fuel cell could constitute an energy outputthe thermodynamic efficiency of the aluminum smelting process is said to be approximately 50 percent therefore at most no more than half the energy that goes into smelting aluminum could be recovered by a fuel cell
for liquid alloys it has been suggested that a liquid gallium tin alloy could be used to cool computer chips in place of water as it conducts heat approximately 65 times better than water it can make a comparable coolant gallium is used in some high temperature thermometers
biomedical applications a low temperature liquid eutectic alloy of gallium indium and tin is widely available in medical thermometers fever thermometers replacing problematic mercury this alloy with the trade name galinstan with the stan referring to the tin has a freezing point of minus20c gallium salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate are used as radiopharmaceutical agents in nuclear medicine imaging the form or salt is not important since it is the free dissolved gallium ion ga3 which is active for these applications a radioactive isotope such as 67ga is used the body handles ga3 in many ways as though it were iron and thus it is bound and concentrates in areas of inflammation such as infection and also areas of rapid cell division this allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques see gallium scan this use has largely been replaced by fluorodeoxyglucose fdg for positron emission tomography pet scan gallium nitrate both oral and topical is finding use in treating arthritis much research is being devoted to gallium alloys as substitutes for mercury dental amalgams but these compounds have yet to see wide acceptance research is being conducted to determine whether gallium can be used to fight bacterial infections in people with cystic fibrosis gallium is similar in size to iron an essential nutrient for respiration when gallium is mistakenly picked up by bacteria such as pseudomonas the bacterias ability to respire is interfered with and the bacteria die the mechanism behind this is that iron is redox active which allows for the transfer of electrons during respiration but gallium is redox inactive
miscellaneous magnesium gallate containing impurities such as mn2 is beginning to be used in ultraviolet activated phosphor powder neutrino detection possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot was the gallex neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an italian mountain tunnel the detector contained 122 tons of watered gallium71 solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of ga71 to become radioactive ge 71 which were detected the solar neutrino flux deduced was found to have a deficit of 40 from theory this was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed see sno as a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam
while not considered toxic the data about gallium are inconclusive some sources suggest that it may cause dermatitis from prolonged exposure other tests have not caused a positive reaction like most metals finely divided gallium loses its luster powdered gallium appears gray when gallium is handled with bare hands the extremely fine dispersion of liquid gallium droplets which results from wetting skin with the metal may appear as a gray skin stain

germanium is a hard grayishwhite element that has a metallic luster and the same crystal structure as diamond in addition it is important to note that germanium is a semiconductor with electrical properties between those of a metal and an insulator in its pure state this metalloid is crystalline brittle and retains its lustre in air at room temperature zone refining techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that have an impurity of only one part in 1010 along with gallium bismuth antimony and water it is one of the few substances that expands as it freezes the oxide form germanium dioxide also has the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light but transparent to infrared light
in 1871 germanium latin germania for germany was one of the elements that dmitri mendeleev predicted to exist as a missing analogue of the silicon group mendeleev called it ekasilicon the existence of this element was proven by clemens winkler in 1886 this discovery was an important confirmation of mendeleevs idea of element periodicity

unlike most semiconductors germanium has a small band gap allowing it to efficiently respond to infrared light it is therefore used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment which require extremely sensitive infrared detectors its oxides index of refraction and dispersion properties make germanium useful in wideangle camera lenses and in microscope objective lenses
germanium transistors are still used in some stompboxes by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the fuzztone from the early rock and roll era most notably the dallas arbiter fuzz face vintage stompboxes known to contain germanium transistors have shown marked increases in collector value for this reason alone
germanium is a highly important infrared optical material and can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows it is used particularly as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14 micron wavelength range for passive thermal imaging and for hotspot detection in military and fire fighting applications the material has a very high refractive index 40 and so needs to be antireflection coated particularly a very hard special antireflection coating of diamondlike carbon dlc refractive index 20is a good match and produces a diamondhard surface that can withstand much environmental rough treatment
the alloy silicon germanide commonly referred to as silicongermanium or sige is rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material for use in high speed integrated circuits circuits utilising the properties of sisige junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone other uses alloying agent see below phosphor in fluorescent lamps catalyst high purity germanium single crystal detectors can precisely identify radiation sources eg for airport security germanium substrate wafers for highefficiency multijunction solar cells for space applications
certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals but have toxic effects against certain bacteria this property makes these compounds useful as chemotherapeutic agents
germanium is useful for single crystal neutron or synchrotron xray monochromator for beamlines the reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy xray applications
high purity germanium crystals are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy
fda research has concluded that germanium when used as a nutritional supplement presents potential human health hazard
in recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys in sterling silver alloys for instance it has been found to reduce firescale increase tarnish resistance and increase the alloys response to precipitation hardening see argentium sterling silver
this element is found in argyrodite sulfide of germanium and silver coal germanite zinc ores and other minerals see also categorygermanium minerals
germanium is obtained commercially from zinc ore processing smelter dust and from the combustion byproducts of certain coals a large reserve of this element is therefore in coal sources
this metalloid can be extracted from other metals by fractional distillation of its volatile tetrachloride this technique permits the production of ultrahigh purity germanium
in 1998 the cost of germanium was about us 170 per gram the year end price for zonerefined germanium has generally decreased since then 19991400 per kilogram or 140 per gram 20001250 per kilogram or 125 per gram 2001890 per kilogram or 089 per gram 2002620 per kilogram or 062 per gram 2003380 per kilogram or 038 per gram 2004600 per kilogram or 060 per gram 2005660 per kilogram or 066 per gram 2006880 per kilogram or 088 per gram

pure germanium is known to spontaneously extrude very long screw dislocations referred to as germanium whiskers the growth of these whiskers is one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium as depending on what they end up touching they may lead to an electrical short
los alamos national laboratory ndash germanium webelementscom ndash germanium gadolinium is a chemical element that has the symbol gd and atomic number 64
gadolinium is a silverywhite malleable and ductile rareearth metal with a metallic luster it crystallizes in hexagonal closepacked alpha form at room temperature but when heated to 1508 k or more it transforms into its beta form which has a bodycentered cubic structure
unlike other rare earth elements gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air however it tarnishes quickly in moist air and forms a looselyadhering oxide that spalls off and then exposes more surface to oxidation gadolinium reacts slowly with water and it is soluble in dilute acids
gadolinium157 has the highest thermal neutron capture crosssection of any known nuclide with the exception of xenon135 49000 barns but it also has a fast burnout rate limiting its usefulness as a nuclear control rod material
gadolinium becomes superconductive below a critical temperature of 1083 k it is strongly paramagnetic at room temperature and exhibits ferromagnetic properties below room temperature
gadolinium demonstrates a magnetocaloric effect whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field the effect is considerably stronger for the gadolinium alloy gd 5 si 2 ge 2
gadolinium is used for making gadolinium yttrium garnets which have microwave applications and gadolinium compounds are used for making phosphors for colour tv tubes gadolinium is also used for manufacturing compact discs and computer memory
gadolinium is used in nuclear marine propulsion systems as a burnable poison the gadolinium slows the initial reaction rate but as it decays other neutron poisons accumulate allowing for longrunning cores gadolinium is also used as a secondary emergency shutdown measure in some nuclear reactors particularly of the candu type
gadolinium also possesses unusual metallurgic properties with as little as 1 of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron chromium and related alloys to high temperatures and oxidation
because of their paramagnetic properties solutions of organic gadolinium complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as intravenous radiocontrast agents to enhance images in medical magnetic resonance imaging magnevist is the most widespread example
besides mri gadolinium gd is also used in other imaging in xray gadolinium is contained in the phosphor layer suspending in a polymer matrix at the detector terbium doped gadolinium oxysulfide gd2o2s tb at the phosphor layer is to convert the xrays releasing from the source into light gd can emit at 540nm green light spectrum 520 570nm which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality of the xray that is exposed to the photographic film beside gds spectrum range the compound also has a kedge at 50 kiloelectron volt kev which means its absorption of xray through photoelectric interactions is great the energy conversion of gd is up to 20 which means onefifth of the xray striking on the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons
gadolinium oxyorthosilicate gd2sio5 gso usually doped by 011 of ce is a single crystal that is used as a scintillator in medical imaging equipment like as positron emission tomography pet and for detecting neutrons
gadolinium gallium garnet gd3ga5o12 is a material with good optical properties and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magnetooptical films
in the future gadolinium ethyl sulfate which has extremely low noise characteristics may be used in masers furthermore gadoliniums high magnetic moment and low curie temperature which lies just at room temperature suggest applications as a magnetic component for sensing hot and cold
due to extremely high neutron crosssection of gadolinium this element is very effective for use with neutron radiography
in 1880 swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac observed spectroscopic lines due to gadolinium in samples of didymium and gadolinite french chemist paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran separated gadolinia the oxide of gadolinium from mosanders yttria in 1886 the element itself was isolated only recently
gadolinium like the mineral gadolinite is named after finnish chemist and geologist johan gadolin
in older literature the natural form of the element is often called an earth meaning that the element came from earth in fact gadolinium is the element that comes from the earth gadolinia earths are compounds of the element and one or more other elements the two most common combiningelements are oxygen and sulfur for example gadolinia contains gadolinium oxide gd2o3
gadolinium has no known native biological role but in research on biological systems it has a few roles it is used as a component of mri contrast agents as in the 3 oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired f electrons this causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly enhancing the quality of the mri scan second as a member of the lanthanides it is used in various ion channel electrophysiology experiments where it is used to block sodium leak channels as well as to stretch activated ion channels
gadolinium is never found in nature as the free element but is contained in many rare minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite it occurs only in trace amounts in the mineral gadolinite which was also named after johan gadolin today it is prepared by ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques or by the reduction of its anhydrous fluoride with metallic calcium
in 1994 the cost of gadolinium was about us 012 per gram and it has only increased in value by about us 001 per gram since then 199455 per pound or 0121 per gram 199555 per pound or 0121 per gram 1996115 per kilogram or 0115 per gram 1997115 per kilogram or 0115 per gram 1998115 per kilogram or 0115 per gram 1999115 per kilogram or 0115 per gram 2000130 per kilogram or 013 per gram 2001130 per kilogram or 013 per gram 2002130 per kilogram or 013 per gram 2003130 per kilogram or 013 per gram 2004130 per kilogram or 013 per gram 2005130 per kilogram or 013 per gram

thirty radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 160gd with a halflife of more than 13times1021 years the decay has not been observed only the lower limit on the halflife is known alphadecaying 152gd with a halflife of 108times1014 years and 150gd with a halflife of 179times106 years all of the remaining isotopes are radioactive having halflives less than 747 years the majority of these have halflives less than 246 seconds gadolinium isotopes have 4 metastable isomers with the most stable being 143mgd t 110 seconds 145mgd t 85 seconds and 141mgd t 245 seconds
the primary decay mode at atomic weights lower than the most abundant stable isotope 158gd is electron capture and the primary mode at higher atomic weights is beta decay the primary decay products for isotopes of weights lower than 158gd are the element eu europium isotopes and the primary products at higher weights are the element tb terbium isotopes

as with the other lanthanides gadolinium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail also in patients on dialysis there are data suggesting that it may cause nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy as a side effect of mri investigations that require the use of a gadolinium based contrast agent

hydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements constituting roughly 75 of the universes elemental mass stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane after which most elemental hydrogen is used captively meaning locally at the production site with the largest markets about equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading eg hydrocracking and ammonia production mostly for the fertilizer market hydrogen may be produced from water using the process of electrolysis but this process is presently significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas
the most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen known as protium has a single proton and no neutrons in ionic compounds it can take on either a positive charge becoming a cation composed of a bare proton or a negative charge becoming an anion known as a hydride hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds it plays a particularly important role in acidbase chemistry in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules as the only neutral atom for which the schrödinger equation can be solved analytically study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics
the solubility and characteristics of hydrogen with various metals are very important in metallurgy as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement and in developing safe ways to store it for use as a fuel hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice
hydrogen gas is highly flammable and will burn at concentrations as low as 4 h2 in air the enthalpy of combustion for hydrogen is 286 kjmol it burns according to the following balanced equation 2 h2g o2g 2 h2ol 572 kjmol
when mixed with oxygen across a wide range of proportions hydrogen explodes upon ignition hydrogen burns violently in air it ignites automatically at a temperature of 560 c pure hydrogenoxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are nearly invisible to the naked eye as illustrated by the faintness of flame from the main space shuttle engines as opposed to the easily visible flames from the shuttle boosters thus it is difficult to visually detect if a hydrogen leak is burning the hindenburg zeppelin is an infamous case of hydrogen combustion pictured although the tragedy was due mainly to combustible materials in the skin of the zeppelin which were also responsible for the coloring of the flames another characteristic of hydrogen fires is that the flames tend to ascend rapidly with the gas in air as illustrated by the hindenberg flames causing less damage than hydrocarbon fires for example twothirds of the hindenburg passengers survived the fire and many of the deaths which occurred were from falling or from diesel fuel burns
the ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is 136 ev which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 92 nm
the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the bohr model of the atom which conceptualizes the electron as orbiting the proton in analogy to the earths orbit of the sun however the electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by bohr the electron in the bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton and therefore only certain allowed energies a more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the schrödinger equation or the equivalent feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton treating the electron as a matter wave reproduces chemical results such as shape of the hydrogen atom more naturally than the particlebased bohr model although the energy and spectral results are the same modeling the system fully using the reduced mass of nucleus and electron as one would do in the twobody problem in celestial mechanics yields an even better formula for the hydrogen spectra and also the correct spectral shifts for the isotopes deuterium and tritium very small adjustments in energy levels in the hydrogen atom which correspond to actual spectral effects may be determined by using a full quantum mechanical theory which corrects for the effects of special relativity see dirac equation and by accounting for quantum effects arising from production of virtual particles in the vacuum and as a result of electric fields see quantum electrodynamics
in hydrogen liquid the electronic ground state energy level is split into hyperfine structure levels because of magnetic effects of the quantum mechanical spin of the electron and proton the energy of the atom when the proton and electron spins are aligned is higher than when they are not aligned the transition between these two states can occur through emission of a photon through a magnetic dipole transition radio telescopes can detect the radiation produced in this process which is used to map the distribution of hydrogen in the galaxy
h2 reacts directly with other oxidizing elements a violent and spontaneous reaction can occur at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine forming the corresponding hydrogen halides hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride
there are two different types of diatomic hydrogen molecules that differ by the relative spin of their nuclei in the orthohydrogen form the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen gas contains about 25 of the para form and 75 of the ortho form also known as the normal form the equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature but since the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form it is unstable and cannot be purified at very low temperatures the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form the physical properties of pure parahydrogen differ slightly from those of the normal form the orthopara distinction also occurs in other hydrogencontaining molecules or functional groups such as water and methylene
the uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho h2 increases with increasing temperature thus rapidly condensed h2 contains large quantities of the highenergy ortho form that convert to the para form very slowly the orthopara ratio in condensed h2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate the hydrogen liquid leading to loss of the liquefied material catalysts for the orthopara interconversion such as iron compounds are used during hydrogen cooling
a molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen or h3 is found in the interstellar medium ism where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays it has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet jupiter this molecule is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density h3 is one of the most abundant ions in the universe and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium
while h2 is not very reactive under standard conditions it does form compounds with most elements millions of hydrocarbons are known but they are not formed by the direct reaction of elementary hydrogen and carbon although synthesis gas production followed by the fischertropsch process to make hydrocarbons comes close to being an exception as this begins with coal and the elemental hydrogen is generated in situ hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative such as halogens eg f cl br i and chalcogens o s se in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge when bonded to fluorine oxygen or nitrogen hydrogen can participate in a form of strong noncovalent bonding called hydrogen bonding which is critical to the stability of many biological molecules hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements such as the metals and metalloids in which it takes on a partial negative charge these compounds are often known as hydrides
hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon because of their general association with living things these compounds came to be called organic compounds the study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry by some definitions organic compounds are only required to contain carbon as a classic historical example urea however most of them also contain hydrogen and since it is the carbonhydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics carbonhydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word organic in chemistry this latter definition is not perfect however as in this definition urea would not be included as an organic compound
in inorganic chemistry hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex this function is particularly common in group 13 elements especially in boranes boron hydrides and aluminum complexes as well as in clustered carboranes
compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides a term that is used fairly loosely to chemists the term hydride usually implies that the h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character denoted hminus the existence of the hydride anion suggested by gn lewis in 1916 for group i and ii saltlike hydrides was demonstrated by moers in 1920 with the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride lih that produced a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode for hydrides other than group i and ii metals the term is quite misleading considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen an exception in group ii hydrides is beh2 which is polymeric in lithium aluminum hydride the alh4minus anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the aliii although hydrides can be formed with almost all maingroup elements the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely for example there are over 100 binary borane hydrides known but only one binary aluminum hydride binary indium hydride has not yet been identified although larger complexes exist
oxidation of h2 formally gives the proton h this species is central to discussion of acids though the term proton is used loosely to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen denoted h a bare proton h cannot exist in solution because of its strong tendency to attach itself to atoms or molecules with electrons to avoid the convenient fiction of the naked solvated proton in solution acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain the hydronium ion h3o organized into clusters to form h9o4 other oxonium ions are found when water is in solution with other solvents
although exotic on earth one of the most common ions in the universe is the hsub3subsupsup ion known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the triatomic hydrogen cation
hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes denoted 1h h and h other highly unstable nuclei 4h to 7h have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature 1h is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 9998 because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name protium h the other stable hydrogen isotope is known as deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in its nucleus deuterium comprises 00026 ndash 00184 by molefraction or atomfraction of hydrogen samples on earth with the lower number tending to be found in samples of hydrogen gas and the higher enrichments 0015 or 150 ppm typical of ocean water deuterium is not radioactive and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water deuterium and its compounds are used as a nonradioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1h nmr spectroscopy heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion h is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus it is radioactive decaying into helium3 through beta decay with a halflife of 1232 years
hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today during the early study of radioactivity various heavy radioactive isotopes were given names but such names are no longer used the symbols d and t instead of h and h are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium but the corresponding symbol p is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium iupac states that while this use is common it is not preferred
hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe making up 75 of normal matter by mass and over 90 by number of atoms this element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets molecular clouds of h2 are associated with star formation hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through protonproton reaction nuclear fusion
throughout the universe hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen as a plasma hydrogens electron and proton are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity producing the light from the sun and other stars the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind they interact with the earths magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium the large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped lymanalpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to redshift z4
under ordinary conditions on earth elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas h2 for data see table however hydrogen gas is very rare in the earths atmosphere 1 ppm by volume because of its light weight which enables it to escape from earths gravity more easily than heavier gases although h atoms and h2 molecules are abundant in interstellar space they are difficult to generate concentrate and purify on earth still hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the earths surface most of the earths hydrogen is in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus methane is a hydrogen source of increasing importance
hydrogen gas h2 was first artificially produced and formally described by t von hohenheim also known as paracelsus 1493 ndash 1541 via the mixing of metals with strong acids he was unaware that the flammable gas produced by this chemical reaction was a new chemical element in 1671 robert boyle rediscovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids which results in the production of hydrogen gas in 1766 henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance by identifying the gas from a metalacid reaction as inflammable air and further finding that the gas produces water when burned cavendish had stumbled on hydrogen when experimenting with acids and mercury although he wrongly assumed that hydrogen was a liberated component of the mercury rather than the acid he was still able to accurately describe several key properties of hydrogen he is usually given credit for its discovery as an element in 1783 antoine lavoisier gave the element the name of hydrogen when he with laplace reproduced cavendishs finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned lavoisiers name for the gas won out
one of the first uses of h2 was for balloons and later airships the h2 was obtained by reacting sulfuric acid and metallic iron infamously h2 was used in the hindenburg airship that was destroyed in a midair fire the highly flammable hydrogen h2 was later replaced for airships and most balloons by the unreactive helium he
because of its relatively simple atomic structure consisting only of a proton and an electron the hydrogen atom together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure furthermore the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation h2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid1920s
one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed but not understood at the time was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures according to quantum theory this behavior arises from the spacing of the quantized rotational energy levels which are particularly widespaced in h2 because of its low mass these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect
large quantities of h2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries the largest application of h2 is for the processing upgrading of fossil fuels and in the production of ammonia the key consumers of h2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation hydrodesulfurization and hydrocracking h2 has several other important uses h2 is used as a hydrogenating agent particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils found in items such as margarine and in the production of methanol it is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid h2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores
apart from its use as a reactant h2 has wide applications in physics and engineering it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding h2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research including superconductivity studies since h2 is lighter than air having a little more than 115th of the density of air it was once widely used as a lifting agent in balloons and airships however this use was curtailed after the hindenburg disaster erroneously convinced the public that the gas was too dangerous for this purpose hydrogen is still regularly used for the inflation of weather balloons
in more recent application hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen sometime called forming gas as a tracer gas for minute leak detection applications can be found in automotive aircraft consumer goods medical device and chemical industry hydrogen is an authorized food additive e 949 that allows food package leak testing among other antioxidizing properties
hydrogens rarer isotopes also each have specific applications deuterium hydrogen2 is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons and in nuclear fusion reactions deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects tritium hydrogen3 produced in nuclear reactors is used in the production of hydrogen bombs as an isotopic label in the biosciences and as a radiation source in luminous paints
the triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the its90 temperature scale at 138033nbspkelvin
hydrogen is not an energy source except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium a technology presently far from development the suns energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen but this process is difficult to achieve on earth elemental hydrogen from solar biological or electrical sources costs more in energy to make than is obtained by burning it hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources such as methane for less energy than required to make it but these sources are unsustainable and are also themselves direct energy sources and are rightly regarded as the basic source of the energy in the hydrogen obtained from them
molecular hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy as a possible carrier of energy on an economywide scale a theoretical advantage of using h2 as an energy carrier is the localization and concentration of environmentally unwelcome aspects of hydrogen manufacture from fossil fuel energy sources for example co2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of h2 production from methane hydrogen used in transportation would burn cleanly without carbon emissions however the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial in addition the energy density of both liquid hydrogen and hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources
h2 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories often as a byproduct of other reactions in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions
in the laboratory h2 is usually prepared by the reaction of acids on metals such as zinc zn 2 h zn2 h2
aluminum produces h2 upon treatment with acids but also with base 2 al 6 h2o 2 aloh3 3 h2
the electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen although the resulting hydrogen necessarily has less energy content than was required to produce it a low voltage current is run through the water and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage if however the gas is to be burnt on site oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals iron for instance would oxidize and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off the theoretical maximum efficiency electricity used vs energetic value of hydrogen produced is between 80 94 bellona report on hydrogen 2h2oaq 2h2g o2g
in 2007 it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen the process creates also creates alumina but the expensive gallium which prevents to formation of an oxide skin on the pellets can be reused this potentially has important implications for a hydrogen economy since hydrogen can be produced onsite and does not need to be transported
hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways but the economically most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas at high temperatures 700 ndash 1100nbspc 1300 ndash 2000nbspf steam water vapor reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and h2 chsub4sub hsub2subo co 3 h2
this reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures 20nbspatm 600nbsp inhg since high pressure h2 is the most marketable product the product mixture is known as synthesis gas because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios one of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon chsub4sub c 2 h2 consequently steam reforming typically employs an excess of h2o
additional hydrogen from steam reforming can be recovered from the carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction especially with an iron oxide catalyst this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide
other important methods for h2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons chsub4sub 05 osub2sub co 2 h2
and the coal reaction which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above
hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process without being separated in the haber process for the production of ammonia the worlds fifth most produced industrial compound hydrogen is generated from natural gas
hydrogen is also produced in usable quantities as a coproduct of the major petrochemical processes of steam cracking and reforming electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a coproduct
h2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms usually via reactions catalyzed by iron or nickel containing enzymes called hydrogenases these enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between h2 and its component two protons and two electrons creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water
water splitting in which water is decomposed into its component protons electrons and oxygen occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms some such organisms including the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h2 gas even in the presence of oxygen
other rarer but mechanistically interesting routes to h2 production also exist in nature nitrogenase produces approximately one equivalent of h2 for each equivalent of n2 reduced to ammonia some phosphatases reduce phosphite to h2
hydrogen is from ancient greek ὕδωρ hydor water and genes forming ancient greek γείνομαι geinomai to beget or sire
the word hydrogen has several different meanings the name of an element an atom sometimes called h dot that is abundant in space but essentially absent on earth because it dimerizes a diatomic molecule that occurs naturally in trace amounts in the earths atmosphere chemists increasingly refer to h2 as dihydrogen or hydrogen molecule to distinguish this molecule from atomic hydrogen and hydrogen found in other compounds the atomic constituent within all organic compounds water and many other chemical compounds
the elemental forms of hydrogen should not be confused with hydrogen as it appears in chemical compounds

helium he is a colorless odorless tasteless nontoxic inert monatomic chemical element that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table and whose atomic number is 2 its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions extreme conditions are also needed to create the small handful of helium compounds which are all unstable at standard temperature and pressure it has a second rare stable isotope which is called helium3 the behavior of liquid helium4 s two fluid phases helium i and helium ii is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics in particular the phenomenon of superfluidity and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter such as superconductivity
helium is the second most abundant and second lightest element in the universe and is one of the elements believed to have been created in the big bang in the modern universe almost all new helium is created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars on earth it is created by the radioactive decay of much heavier elements alpha particles are helium nuclei after its creation part of it is trapped with natural gas in concentrations up to 7 by volume it is extracted from the natural gas by a low temperature separation process called fractional distillation
in 1868 the french astronomer pierre janssen first detected helium as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse since then large reserves of helium have been found in the natural gas fields of the united states which is by far the largest supplier of the gas it is used in cryogenics in deepsea breathing systems to cool superconducting magnets in helium dating for inflating balloons for providing lift in airships and as a protective gas for many industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers
helium is the least reactive member of the noble gas elements and thus also the least reactive of all elements it is inert and monatomic in virtually all conditions due to heliums relatively low molar molecular mass in the gas phase it has a thermal conductivity specific heat and sound conduction velocity that are all greater than any gas except hydrogen for similar reasons and also due to the small size of its molecules heliums diffusion rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65 that of hydrogen
helium is less water soluble than any other gas known and heliums index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas helium has a negative joulethomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand only below its joulethomson inversion temperature of about 40 k at 1 atmosphere does it cool upon free expansion once precooled below this temperature helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling
throughout the universe helium is found mostly in a plasma state whose properties are quite different from atomic helium in a plasma heliums electrons and protons are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity even when the gas is only partially ionized the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen they interact with the earths magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora
helium solidifies only under great pressure the resulting colorless almost invisible solid is highly compressible applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30 with a bulk modulus on the order of 5107 pa it is 50 times more compressible than water unlike any other element helium will fail to solidify and remain a liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures this is a direct effect of quantum mechanics specifically the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing solid helium requires a temperature of 1ndash15nbspk about minus272nbspc or minus457nbspf and about 25nbspbar 25nbspmpa of pressure it is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same the solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure
solid helium has a density of 0214 nbsp0006nbspgml 115nbspk 66nbspatm with a mean isothermal compressibility of the solid at 115nbspk between the solidus and 66nbspatm of 00031nbsp00008atm also no difference in density was noted between 18nbspk and 15nbspk this data projects that t0 solid helium under 25nbspbar of pressure the minimum required to freeze helium has a density of 0187nbsp0009nbspgml
below its boiling point of 422 kelvin and above the lambda point of 21768 kelvin the isotope helium4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state called helium i like other cryogenic liquids helium i boils when it is heated it also contracts when its temperature is lowered until it reaches the lambda point when it stops boiling and suddenly expands the rate of expansion decreases below the lambda point until about 1nbspk is reached at which point expansion completely stops and helium i starts to contract again
helium i has a gaslike index of refraction of 1026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is this colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density oneeighth that of water which is only onefourth the value expected from classical physics
liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual characteristics in a state called helium ii boiling of helium ii is not possible due to its high thermal conductivity heat input instead causes evaporation of the liquid directly to gas the isotope helium3 also has a superfluid phase but only at much lower temperatures as a result less is known about such properties in the isotope helium3
helium ii is a superfluid a quantummechanical state of matter with strange properties for example when it flows through even capillaries of 107 to 108 m width it has no measurable viscosity however when measurements were done between two moving discs a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed current theory explains this using the twofluid model for helium ii in this model liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state which behave more like an ordinary fluid
helium ii also exhibits a creeping effect when a surface extends past the level of helium ii the helium ii moves along the surface seemingly against the force of gravity helium ii will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates it moves in a 30nbsp nm thick film regardless of surface material this film is called a rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait bernard v rollin as a result of this creeping behavior and heliumnbspiis ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings it is very difficult to confine liquid helium unless the container is carefully constructed the heliumnbspii will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer where it will evaporate waves propagating across a rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water but rather than gravity the restoring force is the van der waals force these waves are known as third sound
in the fountain effect a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of heliumnbspii by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which nonsuperfluid helium cannot pass if the interior of the container is heated the superfluid helium changes to nonsuperfluid helium in order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure causing liquid to fountain out of the container
the thermal conductivity of helium ii is greater than that of any other known substance a million times that of helium i and several hundred times that of copper this is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantummechanical mechanism most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat helium ii has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well the flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air so when heat is introduced it will move at 20nbspmeters per second at 18nbspk through heliumnbspii as waves in a phenomenon called second sound
helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties such as its low boiling point low density low solubility high thermal conductivity or inertness helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form as a liquid it can be supplied in small containers called dewars which hold up to 1000 liters of helium or in large iso containers which have nominal capacities as large as 11000 gallons 41637 liters in gaseous form small quantities of helium are supplied in high pressure cylinders holding up to 300 standard cubic feet while large quantities of high pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of up to 180000 standard cubic feet
because it is lighter than air airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift in airships helium is preferred over hydrogen because it is not flammable and has 9264 of the buoyancy or lifting power of the alternative hydrogen see calculation
for its low solubility in water the major part of human blood air mixtures of helium with oxygen and nitrogen trimix with oxygen only heliox with common air heliair and with hydrogen and oxygen hydreliox are used in deepsea breathing systems to reduce the highpressure risk of nitrogen narcosis decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity
at extremely low temperatures liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to produce superconductivity such as in superconducting magnets used in magnetic resonance imaging helium at low temperatures is also used in cryogenics
for its inertness and high thermal conductivity neutron transparency and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions helium is used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors such as pebblebed reactors
helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that are contaminated easily by air it is especially useful in overhead welding because it is lighter than air and thus floats whereas other shielding gases sink
because it is inert helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals in titanium and zirconium production in gas chromatography and as an atmosphere for protecting historical documents this property also makes it useful in supersonic wind tunnels
in rocketry helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel it is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to precool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles for example the saturn v booster used in the apollo program needed about 13 million cubic feet 370000 m of helium to launch
the gain medium of the heliumneon laser is a mixture of helium and neon
because it diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air helium is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in highvacuum equipment and highpressure containers as well as in other applications with less stringent requirements such as heat exchangers valves gas panels etc
because of its extremely low index of refraction the use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes
the age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium radioactive elements that emit helium nuclei called alpha particles can be discovered by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating
the high thermal conductivity and sound velocity of helium is also desirable in thermoacoustic refrigeration the inertness of helium adds to the environmental advantage of this technology over conventional refrigeration systems which may contribute to ozone depleting and global warming effects
because helium alone is less dense than atmospheric air it will change the timbre not pitch of a persons voice when inhaled however inhaling it from a typical commercial source such as that used to fill balloons can be dangerous due to the risk of asphyxiation from lack of oxygen and the number of contaminants that may be present these could include trace amounts of other gases in addition to aerosolized lubricating oil
evidence of helium was first detected on august 18 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 58749 nanometres in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the sun by french astronomer pierre janssen during a total solar eclipse in guntur india this line was initially assumed to be sodium on october 20 of the same year english astronomer norman lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum which he named the d3 line for it was near the known d1 and d2 lines of sodium and concluded that it was caused by an element in the sun unknown on earth he and english chemist edward frankland named the element with the greek word for the sun ἥλιος helios
on 26 march 1895 british chemist william ramsay isolated helium on earth by treating the mineral cleveite with mineral acids ramsay was looking for argon but after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid noticed a brightyellow line that matched the d3 line observed in the spectrum of the sun helium was also isolated by the american geochemist william francis hillebrand prior to ramsays discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite hillebrand however attributed the lines to nitrogen his letter of congratulations to ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and neardiscovery in science
in 1907 ernest rutherford and thomas royds demonstrated that an alpha particle is a helium nucleus in 1908 helium was first liquefied by dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin he tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature where the solid liquid and gas phases are at equilibrium it was first solidified in 1926 by his student willem hendrik keesom by subjecting helium to 25 atmospheres of pressure
in 1938 russian physicist pyotr leonidovich kapitsa discovered that helium4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero a phenomenon now called superfluidity in 1972 the same phenomenon was observed in helium3 by american physicists douglas d osheroff david m lee and robert c richardson
after an oil drilling operation in 1903 in dexter kansas us produced a gas geyser that would not burn kansas state geologist erasmus haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the university of kansas at lawrence where with the help of chemists hamilton cady and david mcfarland he discovered that the gas contained by volume 72 nitrogen 15 methaneinsufficient to make the gas combustible 1 hydrogen and 12 of an unidentifiable gas with further analysis cady and mcfarland discovered that 184 of the gas sample was helium far from being a rare element helium was present in vast quantities under the american great plains available for extraction from natural gas
this put the united states in an excellent position to become the worlds leading supplier of helium following a suggestion by sir richard threlfall the united states navy sponsored three small experimental helium production plants during world war i the goal was to supply barrage balloons with the nonflammable lifting gas a total of 200000 cubic feet 5700 m of 92 helium was produced in the program even though only a few cubic feet less than 100 liters of the gas had previously been obtained
although the extraction process using lowtemperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during world war i production continued helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighterthanair craft this use increased demand during world war ii as well as demands for shielded arc welding helium was also vital in the atomic bomb manhattan project
the government of the united states set up the national helium reserve in 1925 at amarillo texas with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime due to a us military embargo against germany that restricted helium supplies the hindenburg was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas helium use following world war ii was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygenhydrogen rocket fuel among other uses during the space race and cold war helium use in the united states in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption
after the helium acts amendments of 1960 public law 86777 the us bureau of mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas for this helium conservation program the bureau built a 425mile 684nbspkm pipeline from bushton kansas to connect those plants with the governments partially depleted cliffside gas field near amarillo texas this heliumnitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the cliffside gas field until needed when it then was further purified
by 1995 a billion cubic metres of the gas had been collected and the reserve was us14 billion in debt prompting the congress of the united states in 1996 to phase out the reserve the resulting helium privatization act of 1996 public law 104273 directed the united states department of the interior to start liquidating the reserve by 2005
helium produced before 1945 was about 98 pure 2 nitrogen which was adequate for airships in 1945 a small amount of 999 helium was produced for welding use by 1949 commercial quantities of grade a 99995 helium were available
for many years the united states produced over 90 of commercially usable helium in the world extraction plants created in canada poland russia and other nations produced the remaining helium in the mid 1990s a new plant in arzew algeria producing 600mmcf came on stream with enough production to cover all of europes demand subsequently in 20042006 two additional plants one in ras laffen qatar and the other in skikda algeria were built but as of early 2007 ras laffen is functioning at 50 and skikda has yet to start up algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium through this time both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased and during 2007 the major suppliers air liquide airgas and praxair all raised prices from 10 to 30
helium is the second most abundant element in the known universe after hydrogen and constitutes 23 of the elemental mass of the universe it is concentrated in stars where it is formed from hydrogen by the nuclear fusion of the protonproton chain reaction and cno cycle according to the big bang model of the early development of the universe the vast majority of helium was formed during big bang nucleosynthesis from one to three minutes after the big bang as such measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models
in the earths atmosphere the concentration of helium by volume is only 52 parts per million the concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the earths atmosphere escapes into space by several processes in the earths heterosphere a part of the upper atmosphere helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements
nearly all helium on earth is a result of radioactive decay the decay product is primarily found in minerals of uranium and thorium including cleveites pitchblende carnotite monazite and beryl because they emit alpha particles which consist of helium nuclei he2 to which electrons readily combine in this way an estimated 34 litres of helium per year are generated per cubic kilometer of the earths crust in the earths crust the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion in seawater the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion there are also small amounts in mineral springs volcanic gas and meteoric iron the greatest concentrations on the planet are in natural gas from which most commercial helium is derived
for largescale use helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas which contains up to 7 helium since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases mostly nitrogen and methane the resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture activated charcoal is used as a final purification step usually resulting in 99995 pure gradea helium the principal impurity in gradea helium is neon in a final production step most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process this is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers
in 2005 approximately one hundred and sixty million cubic meters of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately 83 from the united states 11 from algeria and most of the remainder from russia and poland in the united states most helium is extracted from natural gas in kansas and texas
diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with highvelocity protons but this is not an economically viable method of production
although there are eight known isotopes of helium only helium3 and helium4 are stable in the earths atmosphere there is one he3 atom for every million he4 atoms however helium is unusual in that its isotopic abundance varies greatly depending on its origin in the interstellar medium the proportion of he3 is around a hundred times higher rocks from the earths crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten this is used in geology to study the origin of such rocks
the most common isotope helium4 is produced on earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium4 nuclei helium4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells it was also formed in enormous quantities during big bang nucleosynthesis
evaporative cooling of liquid helium4 in a socalled 1k pot cools the liquid to about 1nbsp kelvin in a helium3 refrigerator similar cooling of helium3 which has a lower boiling point reaches a temperature of about 02nbspkelvin equal mixtures of liquid helium3 and helium4 below 08nbspk will separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity they follow different quantum statistics helium4 atoms are bosons while helium3 atoms are fermions dilution refrigerators take advantage of the immiscibility of these two isotopes to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins there is only a trace amount of helium3 on earth primarily present since the formation of the earth although some falls to earth trapped in cosmic dust trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium in stars however helium3 is more abundant a product of nuclear fusion extraplanetary material such as lunar and asteroid regolith have trace amounts of helium3 from being bombarded by solar winds
the different formation processes of the two stable isotopes of helium produce the differing isotope abundances these differing isotope abundances can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the earths mantle
it is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes which rapidly decay into other substances the shortestlived heavy helium isotope is helium5 with a halflife of 7610minus22 second helium6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half life of 08 second helium7 also emits a beta particle as well as a gamma ray helium7 and helium8 are hyperfragments that are created in certain nuclear reactions
the exotics helium6 and helium8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo helium2 two protons no neutrons is a radioisotope of helium that decays by proton emission into protium hydrogen with a halflife of 3x10minus27 second
the voice of a person who has inhaled helium temporarily sounds highpitched this is because the speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air because the fundamental frequency of a gasfilled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract
inhaling helium eg to produce the vocal effect can be dangerous if done to excess since helium is a simple asphyxiant thus it displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration death by asphyxiation will result within minutes if pure helium is breathed continuously in mammals with the notable exceptions of seals and many burrowing animals the breathing reflex is triggered by excess of carbon dioxide rather than lack of oxygen so asphyxiation by helium progresses without the victim experiencing air hunger inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders is extremely dangerous as the high flow rate can result in barotrauma fatally rupturing lung tissue
neutral helium at standard conditions is nontoxic plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood at high pressures a mixture of helium and oxygen heliox can lead to high pressure nervous syndrome however increasing the proportion of nitrogen can alleviate the problem
containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 k should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 k is warmed to room temperature
helium is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions due to its valence of zero it is an electrical insulator unless ionized as with the other noble gases helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential helium can form unstable compounds with tungsten iodine fluorine sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to an electric glow discharge through electron bombardment or is otherwise a plasma hene hghe10 whe2 and the molecular ions he2 he22 hehsupsup and hed have been created this way this technique has also allowed the production of the neutral molecule he2 which has a large number of band systems and hghe which is apparently only held together by polarization forces
helium has been put inside the hollow carbon cage molecules the fullerenes by heating under high pressure of the gas the neutral molecules formed are stable up to high temperatures when chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed the helium stays inside if helium3 is used it can be readily observed by helium nmr spectroscopy many fullerenes containing helium3 have been reported these substances fit the definition of compounds in the handbook of chemistry and physics they are the first stable neutral helium compounds to be formed

a trivalent metallic rare earth element holmium has the highest magnetic moment 106µb of any naturallyoccurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties when combined with yttrium it forms highly magnetic compounds
holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion resistant and stable in dry air at standard temperature and pressure in moist air and at higher temperatures however it quickly oxidizes forming a yellowish oxide in pure form holmium possesses a metallic bright silvery luster holmium oxide has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions in daylight it is a tannish yellow color under trichromatic light it is a fiery orange red almost indistinguishable from the way erbium oxide looks under this same lighting this has to do with the sharp emission bands of the phosphors and the absorption bands of both oxides
because of its magnetic properties holmium has been used to create the strongest artificiallygenerated magnetic fields when placed within highstrength magnets as a magnetic pole piece also called a magnetic flux concentrator since it can absorb nuclear fission bred neutrons the element is also used in nuclear control rods other commercial applications of the element include
its very high magnetic moment is suitable for use in yttrium iron garnet yig and yttrium lanthanum fluoride ylf solid state lasers found in microwave equipment which are in turn found in a variety of medical and dental settings
holmium oxide is used as a yellow or red glass coloring holmium containing glass has been used as a calibration standard for uvvisible spectrophotometers holmium is one of the colorants used for cubic zirconia for use in jewelry providing a dichromic color in peach or yellow depending on the lighting source holmium is used in a laser to break up kidney stones while being minimally invasive
few other uses have been identified for this element
holmium holmia latin name for stockholm was discovered by marc delafontaine and jacqueslouis soret in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic absorption bands of the thenunknown element they called it element x later in 1878 per teodor cleve independently discovered the element while he was working on erbia earth erbium oxide
using the method developed by carl gustaf mosander cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia the result of that effort was two new materials one brown and one green he named the brown substance holmia after the latin name for cleves home town stockholm and the green one thulia holmia was later found to be the holmium oxide and thulia was thulium oxide
like all other rare earths holmium is not naturally found as a free element it does occur combined with other elements in the minerals gadolinite monazite and in other rareearth minerals it is commercially extracted via ionexchange from monazite sand 005 holmium but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths the element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous chloride or fluoride with metallic calcium its estimated abundance in the earth s crust is 13 milligrams per kilogram holmium obeys the oddoharkins rule as an oddnumbered element it is less abundant than its immediate even numbered neighbors dysprosium and erbium however it is the most abundant of the oddnumbered heavy lanthanides the principal current source are some of the ionadsorption clays of southern china some of these have a rare earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite yttrium makes up about twothirds of the total by weight holmium is around 15 the original ores themselves are very lean maybe only 01 total lanthanide but are easily extracted
natural holmium contains one stable isotope holmium 165 some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known the most stable one is holmium 163 with a half life of 4570 years all other radioisotopes have half lives not greater than 1117 days and most have half lives under 3 hours
the element as with other rare earths appears to have a low acute toxic rating holmium plays no biological role in humans but may be able to stimulate metabolism

hafnium is a shiny silvery ductile metal that is corrosion resistant and chemically similar to zirconium the physical properties of hafnium are markedly affected by zirconium impurities and these two elements are among the most difficult ones to separate a notable physical difference between them is their density zirconium being about half as dense as hafnium but chemically the elements are extremely similar
the most notable physical property of hafnium is that it has a very high neutroncapture crosssection and several isotopes of hafnium nuclei can absorb multiple neutrons this makes hafnium a good material for use in the control rods for nuclear reactors its neutroncapture crosssection is about 600 times that of zirconium other elements that are good neutronabsorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron
separation of hafnium and zirconium becomes very important in the nuclear power industry since zirconium is a good fuelrod cladding metal with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture crosssection and a good chemical stability at high temperatures however because of hafniums neutronabsorbing properties hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear reactor materials applications thus a nearlycomplete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power
hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known with a melting point 3890 c and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides with a melting point of 3310 c this has led to proposals that hafnium or its carbides might be useful as construction materials that are subjected to very high temperatures
the metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis but halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides
the nuclear isomer hf178m2 is also a source of cascades of gamma rays whose energies total to 245nbsp mev per decay it is notable because it has the highest excitation energy of any comparably longlived isomer of any element one gram of pure hf178m2 would contain approximately 1330 megajoules of energy the equivalent of exploding about 317 kilograms 700 pounds of tnt possible applications requiring such highly concentrated energy storage are of interest for example it has been studied as a possible power source for gamma ray lasers
hafnium is used to make control rods for nuclear reactors because of its ability to absorb neutrons its thermal neutron absorption cross section is nearly 600 times that of zirconium excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosionresistance properties
other uses in gasfilled and incandescent lamps for scavenging oxygen and nitrogen as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air and in iron titanium niobium tantalum and other metal alloys a hafniumbased compound is employed in gate insulators in the 45nbspnm generation of integrated circuits from intel ibm and others hafnium oxidebased compounds are practical highk dielectrics allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales darpa has been intermittently funding programs in the us to determine the possibility of using a nuclear isomer of hafnium the above mentioned hf178m2 to construct small high yield weapons with simple xray triggering mechanismsmdashan application of induced gamma emission that work follows over two decades of basic research by an international community into the means for releasing the stored energy upon demand there is considerable opposition to this program both because the idea may not work and because uninvolved countries might perceive an imagined isomer weapon gap that would justify their further development and stockpiling of conventional nuclear weapons a related proposal is to use the same isomer to power unmanned aerial vehicles which could remain airborne for weeks at a time
the 1869 periodic table by mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium but in 1871 mendeleev placed lanthanum in that spot
the existence of a gap in the periodic table for a yet to be discovered element 72 was predicted by henry moseley in 1914 hafnium was named for the latin name hafnia for copenhagen the home town of niels bohr it was discovered by dirk coster and georg von hevesy in 1923 in copenhagen denmark validating the original 1869 prediction of mendeleev soon thereafter the new element was predicted to be associated with zirconium by using the bohr theories of the atom and it was finally found in zircon through xray spectroscopy analysis in norway
hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by jantzen and von hevesey metallic hafnium was first prepared by anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament this process for differential purification of zr and hf is still in use today
the faculty of science of the university of copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of hafnium
hafnium is estimated to make up about 000058 of the earth s upper crust by weight it is found combined in natural zirconium compounds but it does not exist as a free element in nature minerals that contain zirconium such as alvite hf th zr si o 4 hsub2subo thortveitite and zircon zrsio4 usually contain between 1 and 5 hafnium hafnium and zirconium have nearly identical chemistry which makes the two difficult to separate about half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a byproduct of zirconium refinement this is done through reducing hafniumiv chloride with magnesium or sodium in the kroll process
a major source of zircon and hence hafnium ores are heavy mineral sands ore deposits pegmatites particularly in brazil and malawi and carbonatite intrusions particularly the crown polymetallic deposit at mount weld western australia a potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zirconhafnium silicates eudialyte or armostrongite at dubbo in new south wales australia
care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because like its sister metal zirconium when hafnium is divided into fine particles it is pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air see dragons breath for a demonstration compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people the pure metal is not considered toxic but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they are toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds

hassium was first synthesized in 1984 by a german research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried münzenberg at the institute for heavy ion research gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung in darmstadt the name hassium was proposed by them derived from the latin name for the german state of hessen where the institute is located
there was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus iupac adopted unniloctium symbol uno as a temporary element name for this element in 1994 a committee of iupac recommended that element 108 be named hahnium the name hassium was adopted internationally in 1997
isotope 270 of hassium discovered by an international team of scientists led by the technical university of munich in december 2006 is a doubly magic isotope with an unusually long halflife of 22 seconds the existence of such relatively stable heavy isotopes had already been theoretically predicted with some theories suggesting hassium270 may form part of an island of stability

iron is believed to be the sixth most abundant element in the universe formed as the final act of nucleosynthesis by carbon burning in massive stars iron is the most abundant element on earth while it makes up only about 5 of the earths crust the earths core is believed to consist largely of a metallic iron nickel alloy comprising 35 of the mass of the earth as a whole iron is the fourth most abundant element in the earths crust and the second most abundant metal after aluminium most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite magnetite and taconite about 5 of the meteorites similarly consist of ironnickel alloy although rare these are the major form of natural metallic iron on the earths surface the reason for mars red colour is thought to be an ironoxiderich soil
see also iron minerals iron is a metal extracted mainly from the iron ore hematite it oxidises readily in air and water and is rarely found as a free element in order to obtain elemental iron oxygen and other impurities must be removed by chemical reduction iron is the main constituent of steel and it is used in the production of alloys or solid solutions of various metals as well as some nonmetals particularly carbon the many iron alloys which have very different properties are discussed in the article on steel
nuclei of iron have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon surpassed only by the nickel isotope 62ni the universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is however 56fe this is formed by nuclear fusion in stars although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62ni conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured and iron abundance on earth greatly favors iron over nickel and also presumably in supernova element production when a very large star contracts at the end of its life internal pressure and temperature rise allowing the star to produce progressively heavier elements despite these being less stable than the elements around mass number 60 known as the iron group this leads to a supernova
iron as fe2 ferrous ion is a necessary trace element used by almost all living organisms the only exceptions are a few prokaryotic organisms which live in ironpoor conditions such as the lactobacilli in ironpoor milk which use manganese for catalysis instead as well as organisms which use hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin ironcontaining enzymes usually containing heme prosthetic groups participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology and in transport of a number of soluble gases see hemoglobin cytochrome and catalase
iron is the most used of all the metals comprising 95 of all the metal tonnage produced worldwide its combination of low cost and high strength make it indispensable especially in applications like automobiles the hulls of large ships and structural components for buildings steel is the best known alloy of iron and some of the forms that iron can take include

the main drawback to iron and steel is that pure iron and most of its alloys suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way painting galvanization plastic coating and bluing are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by sacrificial protection
iron is believed to be the critical missing nutrient in the ocean that limits the growth of plankton experimental iron fertilization of areas of the ocean using ironii sulfate has proven successful in increasing plankton growth larger scaled efforts are being attempted with the hope that iron seeding and ocean plankton growth can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere thereby counteracting the greenhouse effect that is generally agreed by climatologists to cause global warming

the first iron used by mankind far back in prehistory came from meteors the smelting of iron in bloomeries probably began in anatolia or the caucasus in the second millennium bc or the latter part of the preceding one cast iron was first produced in china about 550 bc but not in europe until the medieval period during the medieval period means were found in europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron in this context known as pig iron using finery forges for all these processes charcoal was required as fuel
steel with a smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron was first produced in antiquity new methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century ad in the industrial revolution new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel in the late 1850s henry bessemer invented a new steelmaking process involving blowing air through molten pig iron to produce mild steel this and other 19th century and later processes have led to wrought iron no longer being produced
ninety percent of all mining of metallic ores is for the extraction of iron industrially iron is produced starting from iron ores principally haematite nominally fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 by a carbothermic reaction reduction with carbon in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000 c in a blast furnace iron ore carbon in the form of coke and a flux such as limestone which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material are fed into the top of the furnace while a blast of heated air is forced into the furnace at the bottom
in the furnacehotoven the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce carbon monoxide
2 c osub2sub 2 co
the carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore in the chemical equation below hematite to molten iron becoming carbon dioxide in the process
3 co fesub2subosub3sub 2 fe 3 cosub2sub
the flux is present to melt impurities in the ore principally silicon dioxide sand and other silicates common fluxes include limestone principally calcium carbonate and dolomite calciummagnesium carbonate other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore in the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide quicklime
cacosub3sub cao cosub2sub then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a slag
cao siosub2sub casiosub3sub the slag melts in the heat of the furnace which silicon dioxide would not have in the bottom of the furnace the molten slag floats on top of the more dense molten iron and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately the iron once cooled is called pig iron while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineralpoor soils for agriculture
pig iron is not pure iron but has 45 carbon dissolved in it this is subsequently reduced to steel or commercially pure iron known as wrought iron using other furnaces or converters
in 2005 approximately 1544 mt million metric tons of iron ore was produced worldwide china was the top producer of iron ore with at least onefourth world share followed by brazil australia and india reports the british geological survey
naturally occurring iron consists of four isotopes 5845 of radioactive 54fe halflife 311022 years 91754 of stable 56fe 2119 of stable 57fe and 0282 of stable 58fe 60fe is an extinct radionuclide of long halflife 15 million years
much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of fe has centered on determining 60fe variations due to processes accompanying nucleosynthesis ie meteorite studies and ore formation in the last decade however advances in mass spectrometry technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute naturallyoccurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron much of this work has been driven by the earth and planetary science communities although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge
the isotope 56fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists a common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on 56fe and still liberate energy this is not true as both 62ni and 58fe are more stable being the most stable nuclei however since 56fe is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in nuclear reactions it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars and is therefore common in the universe relative to other metals
in phases of the meteorites semarkona and chervony kut a correlation between the concentration of 60 ni the daughter product of 60fe and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of 60fe at the time of formation of the solar system possibly the energy released by the decay of 60fe contributed together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide 26 al to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 46 billion years ago the abundance of 60 ni present in extraterrestrial material may also provide further insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history of the stable isotopes only 57fe has a nuclear spin minus12
the usage of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the reduction of nitro compounds additionally iron has been used for desulfurizations reduction of aldehydes and the deoxygenation of amine oxides
iron is essential to nearly all known organisms in cells iron is generally stored in the centre of metalloproteins because free iron which binds nonspecifically to many cellular components can catalyse production of toxic free radicals
in animals plants and fungi iron is often incorporated into the heme complex heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins which mediate redox reactions and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin myoglobin and leghemoglobin inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the ironsulfur clusters of many enzymes such as nitrogenase involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen and hydrogenase nonheme iron proteins include the enzymes methane monooxygenase oxidizes methane to methanol ribonucleotide reductase reduces ribose to deoxyribose dna biosynthesis hemerythrins oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates and purple acid phosphatase hydrolysis of phosphate esters
iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron so restricting its availability to bacteria generally by sequestering it inside cells can help to prevent or limit infections this is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk a major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin which binds iron absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells
good sources of dietary iron include red meat fish poultry lentils beans leaf vegetables tofu chickpeas blackeyed peas potatoes with skin bread made from completely wholegrain flour molasses teff and farina iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables
iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as iron ii fumarate although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well elemental iron despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour where it is listed as reduced iron in the list of ingredients iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable than any other and is also available for use as a common iron supplement often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid glycine leading to iron glycinate supplements the rda for iron varies considerably based on age gender and source of dietary iron heme based iron has higher bioavailability infants will require iron supplements if they are not breastfed blood donors are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake
excessive iron can be toxic because free ferrous iron reacts with peroxides to produce free radicals which are highly reactive and can damage dna proteins lipids and other cellular components thus iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron
iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body which has no physiological means of excreting iron so controls iron levels solely by regulating uptake although uptake is regulated large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can cause damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract that prevents them from regulating iron absorption high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the heart liver and elsewhere which can cause serious problems including longterm organ damage and even death
humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every kilogram of mass and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a lethal dose overconsumption of iron often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six
regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the hlah gene region on chromosome 6 in these people excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders such as hemochromatosis many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem for this reason it is advised that people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 03 and 08 of caucasians
the medical management of iron toxicity is complex and can include use of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body

indium is a very soft silvery white relatively rare true metal with a bright luster as a pure metal indium emits a highpitched cry when it is bent both gallium and indium are able to wet glass
one unusual property of indium is that its most common isotope is slightly radioactive it very slowly decays by beta emission to tin this radioactivity is not considered hazardous mainly because its halflife is 441 years four orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe and nearly 50000 times longer than that of natural thorium unlike its period 5 neighbor cadmium indium is not a notorious cumulative poison
the first largescale application for indium was as a coating for bearings in highperformance aircraft engines during world war ii afterwards production gradually increased as new uses were found in fusible alloys solders and electronics in the 1950s tiny beads of it were used for the emitters and collectors of alloy junction transistors in the middle and late 1980s the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays lcd aroused much interest by 1992 the thinfilm application had become the largest end use other uses for manufacture of lowmeltingtemperature alloys an alloy consisting of 24 indium and 76 gallium is liquid at room temperature some indium compounds such as indium antimonide indium phosphide and indium nitride are semiconductors with useful properties component required for synthesis of the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide cigs which is used for the manufacture of thin film solar cells used in lightemitting diodes leds and laser diodes lds based on compound semiconductors that are fabricated by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy movpe technology the ultrapure metalorganics of indium specifically high purity trimethylindium tmi is used as a precursor in iiiv compound semiconductors while it is also used as the semiconductor dopant in iivi compound semiconductors can also be plated onto metals and evaporated onto glass which forms a mirror which is as good as those made with silver but has higher corrosion resistance indium oxide in2o3 is used as a transparent conductive glass substrate in the making of electroluminescent panels used as a light filter in low pressure sodium vapor lamps indiums freezing point of 4297485 k 1565985 c is a defining fixed point on the international temperature scale its90 indiums high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons makes it suitable for use in control rods for nuclear reactors typically in an alloy containing 80 silver 15 indium and 5 cadmium in nuclear engineering the nn reactions of 113in and 115in are used to determine magnitudes of neutron fluxes 111in is used in medical imaging to monitor the activity of white blood cells a blood test is taken from the patient white cells removed and labelled with the radioactive 111in then reinjected back into the patient gamma imaging will reveal any areas of high white cell activity such as an abscess very small amounts used in aluminium alloy sacrificial anodes for salt water applications to prevent passivation of the aluminium in the form of a wire it is used as a vacuum seal in cryogenics applications used as a calibration material for thermogravimetric analysis devices
indium named after the indigo line in its atomic spectrum was discovered by ferdinand reich and hieronymous theodor richter in 1863 while they were testing zinc ores with a spectrograph in search of thallium richter went on to isolate the metal in 1867
indium ranks 61st in abundance in the earths crust at approximately 025 ppm which means it is more than three times as abundant as silver which occurs at 0075 ppm up until 1924 there was only about a gram of isolated indium on the planet indium is produced mainly from residues generated during zinc ore processing but is also found in iron lead and copper ores canada is a leading producer of indium the teck cominco refinery in trail bc is the largest single source with production of 32500 kg in 2005 41800 kg in 2004 and 36100 kg in 2003
the amount of indium consumed is largely a function of worldwide lcd production worldwide production is currently 476 tonnes per year from mining and a further 650 tonnes per year from recycling demand has risen rapidly in recent years with the popularity of lcd computer monitors and televisions which now account for 50 of indium consumption increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling especially in japan maintain a balance between demand and supply demand increased as the metal is used in lcds and televisions and supply decreased when a number of chinese mining concerns stopped extracting indium from their zinc tailings in 2002 the price was us 94 per kilogram the recent changes in demand and supply have resulted in high and fluctuating prices of indium which from 2005 to 2007 ranged from us700kg to us1000kg demand for indium is likely to continue to increase with largescale manufacture of cigs based thin film solar technology starting by several companies in 2008 including nanosolar and miasole
based on content of indium in zinc ore stocks there is a worldwide reserve base of approximately 6000 tonnes of economicallyviable indium this figure has led to estimates suggesting that at current consumption rates there is only 13 years supply of indium left however such estimates are often regarded as alarmist and scaremongering the indium corporation the largest processor of indium claim that on the basis of increasing recovery yields during extraction recovery from a wider range of base metals including tin copper and other polymetallic deposits and new mining investments the longterm supply of indium is sustainable reliable and sufficient to meet increasing future demands this conclusion also seems reasonable in light of the fact that silver a less abundant element is currently mined at approximately 18300 tonnes per annum which is 40 times greater than current indium mining rates
pure indium in metal form is considered nontoxic by most sources in the welding and semiconductor industries where indium exposure is relatively high there have been no reports of any toxic sideeffects
this may not be the case with indium compounds there is some unconfirmed evidence that suggests that indium has a low level of toxicity other sources are more definite about indium compounds toxicity for example the webelements website states that all indium compounds should be regarded as highly toxic indium compounds damage the heart kidney and liver and may be teratogenic for example indium trichloride anhydrous incl3 is quite toxic while indium phosphide inp is both toxic and a suspected carcinogen
indium compounds webelementscom ndash indium the indium corporation reducing agents indium low valent iodine or from violet is a chemical element that has the symbol i and atomic number 53 iodine has 53 protons 53 electrons and 74 neutrons chemically iodine is the least reactive of the halogens and the most electropositive halogen after astatine iodine is primarily used in medicine photography and dyes it is required in trace amounts by most living organisms
as with all other halogens members of group vii in the periodic table iodine forms diatomic molecules and hence has the molecular formula of i2
iodine is a darkgraypurplebrown solid that sublimes at standard temperatures into a purplepink gas that has an irritating odor this halogen forms compounds with many elements but is less active than the other members of its group vii halogens and has some metalliclike properties iodine dissolves easily in chloroform carbon tetrachloride the solubility of elementary iodine in water can be vastly increased by the addition of potassium iodide the molecular iodine reacts reversibly with the negative ion creating the triiodide anion i3 which dissolves well in water this is also the formulation of medicinal iodine of old the deep blue color of starch iodine complexes is produced only by the free element
many students who have seen the classroom demonstration where iodine crystals are gently heated in a test tube come away with the impression that liquid iodine cannot exist at atmospheric pressure this misconception arises because sublimation occurs without the intermediacy of liquid the truth is that if iodine crystals are heated carefully to their melting point of 1137 c the crystals will fuse into a liquid which will be present under a dense blanket of the vapour
iodine was discovered by bernard courtois in 1811 he was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter a vital part of gunpowder at the time of the napoleonic wars france was at war and saltpeter was in great demand saltpeter produced from french niter beds required sodium carbonate which could be isolated from seaweed washed up on the coasts of normandy and brittany to isolate the sodium carbonate seaweed was burned and the ash then washed with water the remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid one day courtois added too much sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapor rose courtois noted that the vapor crystallized on cold surfaces making dark crystals courtois suspected that this was a new element but lacked the money to pursue his observations
however he gave samples to his friends charles bernard desormes 1777 1862 and nicolas clément 1779 1841 to continue research he also gave some of the substance to joseph louis gaylussac 1778 1850 a wellknown chemist at that time and to andrémarie ampère 1775 1836 on 29 november 1813 dersormes and clément made public courtois discovery they described the substance to a meeting of the imperial institute of france on december 6 gaylussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen ampère had given some of his sample to humphry davy 1778 1829 davy did some experiments on the substance and noted its similarity to chlorine davy sent a letter dated december 10 to the royal society of london stating that he had identified a new element a large argument erupted between davy and gaylussac over who identified iodine first but both scientists acknowledged courtois as the first to isolate the chemical element

iodine naturally occurs in the environment chiefly as dissolved iodide in seawater although it is also found in some minerals and soils the element may be prepared in an ultrapure form through the reaction of potassium iodide with copperii sulfate there are also a few other methods of isolating this element although the element is actually quite rare kelp and certain other plants have some ability to concentrate iodine which helps introduce the element into the food chain as well as keeping its cost down
iodine is found in the mineral caliche found in chile between the andes and the sea it can also be found in some seaweeds as well as extracted from seawater however extracting iodine from the mineral is the only economical way to extract the substance
extraction from seawater involves electrolysis the brine is first purified and acidified using sulphuric acid and is then reacted with chlorine an iodine solution is produced but it is yet too dilute and has to be concentrated to do this air is blown into the solution which causes the iodine to evaporate then it is passed into an absorbing tower containing acid where sulfur dioxide is added to reduce the iodine the solution is then added to chlorine again to concentrate the solution more and the final solution is at a level of about 99
another source is from kelp this source was used in the 18th and 19th centuries but is no longer economically viable
in 2005 chile was the top producer of iodine with almost twothirds world share followed by japan and the usa reports the british geological survey
the average price for iodine in 2005 was 703 us dollars per kilogram in 2006 this suddenly changed to 1703 us dollars per kilogram in chile the worlds largest producer of iodine prices dramatically changed too 2005 1697 us dollars 2006 2000 us dollars for one kilogram japans prices of iodine also changed the dnsc defence national stockpile center claims they sold one kilogram of iodine in 2005 for 1836 us dollars then in 2006 they claimed they sold each kilogram for 2129 us dollars

see also iodine compounds iodine is an essential trace element its only known roles in biology are as constituents of the thyroid hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 these are made from addition condensation products of the amino acid tyrosine and are stored prior to release in a proteinlike molecule called thryroglobulin t4 and t3 contain four and three atoms of iodine per molecule respectively the thyroid gland actively absorbs iodide from the blood to make and release these hormones into the blood actions which are regulated by a second hormone tsh from the pituitary thyroid hormones are phylogenetically very old molecules which are synthesized by most multicellular organisms and which even have some effect on unicellular organisms
thyroid hormones play a very basic role in biology acting on gene transcription to regulate the basal metabolic rate the total deficiency of thyroid hormones can reduce basal metabolic rate up to 50 while in excessive production of thyroid hormones the basal metabolic rate can be increased by 100 t4 acts largely as a precursor to t3 which is with some minor exceptions the biologically active hormone
the united states food and drug administration recommends 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women this is necessary for proper production of thyroid hormone natural sources of iodine include sea life such as kelp and certain seafood as well as plants grown on iodinerich soil salt for human consumption is often fortified with iodine and is referred to as iodized salt
in areas where there is little iodine in the dietmdashtypically remote inland areas and semiarid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eatenmdash iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism symptoms of which are extreme fatigue goitre mental slowing depression weight gain and low basal body temperatures
iodine deficiency is also the leading cause of preventable mental retardation an effect which happens primarily when babies and small children are made hypothyroid by lack of the element the addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem in the developing world
the artificial radioisotope 131i a beta emitter also known as radioiodine which has a halflife of 80207 days has been used in treating cancer and other pathologies of the thyroid glands 123i is the radioisotope most often used in nuclear imaging of the kidney and thyroid as well as thyroid uptake scans used for the evaluation of graves disease the most common compounds of iodine are the iodides of sodium and potassium ki and the iodates kio3
129i halflife 157 million years is a product of 130 xe spallation in the atmosphere and uranium and plutonium fission both in subsurface rocks and nuclear reactors nuclear processes in particular nuclear fuel reprocessing and atmospheric nuclear weapons tests have now swamped the natural signal for this isotope 129i was used in rainwater studies following the chernobyl accident it also has been used as a groundwater tracer and as an indicator of nuclear waste dispersion into the natural environment
if humans are exposed to radioactive iodine the thyroid gland will absorb it as if it were nonradioactive iodine leading to elevated chances of thyroid cancer isotopes with shorter halflives such as 131i present a greater risk than those with longer halflives since they generate more radiation per unit of time taking large amounts of regular iodine will saturate the thyroid and prevent uptake iodine pills are sometimes distributed to persons living close to nuclear establishments for use in case of accidents that could lead to releases of radioactive iodine iodine123 and iodine125 are used in medicine as tracers for imaging and evaluating the function of the thyroid iodine131 is used in medicine for treatment of thyroid cancer and graves disease uncombined elemental iodine is mildly toxic to all living things potassium iodide ki tablets or sski saturated solution of ki liquid drops can be given to people in a nuclear disaster area when fission has taken place to flush out the radioactive iodine131 fission product the halflife of iodine131 is only eight days so the treatment would need to continue only a couple of weeks in cases of leakage of certain nuclear materials without fission or certain types of dirty bomb made with other than radioiodine this precaution would be of no avail
in the 1970s imaging techniques were developed in california to utilize radioiodine in diagnostics for renal hypertension
there are 37 isotopes of iodine and only one 127i is stable
in many ways 129i is similar to sup36supcl it is a soluble halogen fairly nonreactive exists mainly as a nonsorbing anion and is produced by cosmogenic thermonuclear and insitu reactions in hydrologic studies 129i concentrations are usually reported as the ratio of 129i to total i which is virtually all 127i as is the case with 36clcl 129ii ratios in nature are quite small 1014 to 1010 peak thermonuclear 129ii during the 1960s and 1970s reached about 107 129i differs from 36cl in that its halflife is longer 157 vs 0301 million years it is highly biophilic and occurs in multiple ionic forms commonly i and iosub3subsupsup which have different chemical behaviors this makes it fairly easy for 129i to enter the biosphere as it becomes incorporated into vegetation soil milk animal tissue etc
excesses of stable 129xe in meteorites have been shown to result from decay of primordial 129i produced newly by the supernovas which created the dust and gas from which the solar system formed 129i was the first extinct radionuclide to be identified as present in the early solar system its decay is the basis of the ixe radiometric dating scheme which covers the first 83 million years of solar system evolution
effects of various radioiodine isotopes in biology are discussed below
excess iodine has symptoms similar to those of iodine deficiency commonly encountered symptoms are abnormal growth of the thyroid gland and disorders in functioning and growth of the organism as a whole elemental iodine i2 is a deadly poison if taken in larger amounts if 23 grams of it is consumed it is fatal to humans iodides are similar in toxicity to bromides
direct contact with skin can cause lesions so it should be handled with care iodine vapor is very irritating to the eye and to mucous membranes concentration of iodine in the air should not exceed 1 mg m eighthour timeweighted average when mixed with ammonia it can form nitrogen triiodide which is extremely sensitive and can explode unexpectedly

a platinum group metal iridium is white resembling platinum but with a slight yellowish cast due to its extreme hardness and brittleness iridium is difficult to machine form or work it is the most corrosion resistant metal known iridium cannot be attacked by any acids or by aqua regia but it can be attacked by molten salts such as nacl and nacn
the measured density of iridium is only slightly lower than that of osmium which is often listed as the densest element known however calculations of density from the space lattice may produce more reliable data for these elements than actual measurements and give a density of 22650 kgm for iridium versus 22610 kgm for osmium definitive selection between the two is therefore not possible at this time
the principal use of iridium is as a hardening agent in platinum alloys other uses crucibles and devices that require high temperatures electrical contacts notable example ptir spark plugs osmiumiridium alloys are used for compass bearings iridium is commonly used in complexes like irmppy3 and other complexes in polymer led technology to increase the efficiency from 25 to almost 100 due to triplet harvesting used as a source of radioactivity ir192 for the treatment of cancer in particular high dose rate prostate brachytherapy and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy iridium is used as a catalyst for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid iridium is used in supercolliders in the production of antimatter specifically antiprotons at one time iridium as an alloy with platinum was used in bushing the vents of heavy ordnance and in a finely powdered condition iridium black for painting porcelain black
iridium was used to tip some earlytwentiethcentury fountain pen nibs the tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called iridium although there is seldom any iridium in it an exception to this are the jml fountain pens sold in the uk
iridium was discovered in 1803 by british scientist smithson tennant in london england along with osmium in the darkcoloured residue of dissolving crude platinum in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid the element was named after the latin word for rainbow iris iridium means of rainbows because many of its salts are strongly coloured
an alloy of 90 platinum and 10 iridium was used in 1889 to construct the standard metre bar and kilogramme mass kept by the international bureau of weights and measures near paris the metre bar was replaced as the definition of the fundamental unit of length in 1960 see krypton but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass
the kt boundary of 65 million years ago marking the temporal border between the cretaceous and tertiary eras of geological time was identified by a thin stratum of iridiumrich clay a team led by luis alvarez 1980 proposed an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact their theory is widely accepted to explain the demise of the dinosaurs a large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 65 million years was later identified near what is now yucatán peninsula dewey m mclean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead the earth s core is rich in iridium and piton de la fournaise on réunion for example is still releasing iridium today
iridium is found uncombined in nature with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits naturally occurring iridium alloys include osmiridium and iridiosmium both of which are mixtures of iridium and osmium it is recovered commercially as a byproduct from nickel mining and processing
iridium is the rarest nonradioactive nonnoble gas element in the earth s crust but it is relatively common in meteorites iridium and osmium are the densest elements and both are believed to have dropped below the earths crust toward the core when the earth was young and molten the concentration of iridium in meteorites matches the concentration of iridium in the earth as a whole
there are two natural isotopes of iridium and many radioisotopes the most stable radioisotope being ir192 with a halflife of 7383 days ir192 beta decays into platinum192 while most of the other radioisotopes decay into osmium
iridium metal is mostly nontoxic due to its relative unreactivity
los alamos national laboratory iridium webelementscom iridium picture in the element collection from pniokde lithium is a chemical element with the symbol li and atomic number 3 it is a soft alkali metal with a silverwhite color under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element like all alkali metals lithium is highly reactive corroding quickly in moist air to form a black tarnish for this reason lithium metal is typically stored under the cover of oil
according to theory lithium mostly 7li was one of the few elements synthesized in the big bang although its quantity has vastly decreased the reasons for its disappearance and the processes by which new lithium is created continue to be important matters of study in astronomy lithium is the 33rd most abundant element on earth but due to its high reactivity only appears naturally in the form of compounds lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals but is also commonly obtained from brines and clays on a commercial scale lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride
trace amounts of lithium are present in the oceans and in some organisms though the element serves no apparent biological function in humans nevertheless the neurological effect of the lithium ion li makes some lithium salts useful as a class of mood stabilizing drugs lithium and its compounds have several other commercial applications including heatresistant glass and ceramics high strengthtoweight alloys used in aircraft and lithium batteries lithium also has important links to nuclear physics the splitting of lithium atoms was the first manmade form of nuclear reaction and lithium deuteride serves as the fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons
petalite lithium aluminum silicate was first described in 1800 by the brazilian scientist josé bonifácio de andrade e silva who discovered the mineral in a swedish iron mine on the island of utö however it was not until 1817 that johan august arfwedson then a trainee in the laboratory of jöns jakob berzelius discovered the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore the element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less water soluble and had a larger capacity to neutralize acid berzelius gave the alkaline material the name lithion from the greek λιθoς lithos stone to reflect its discovery in a mineral as opposed to sodium and potassium which had been discovered in plant tissue its name would later be standardized as lithium arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the mineral ores spodumene and lepidolite in 1818 christian gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color in flame however both arfwedson and gmelin tried and failed to isolate the element from its salts
the element was not isolated until 1821 when william thomas brande performed electrolysis on lithium oxide a process which had previously been employed by sir humphry davy to isolate potassium and sodiumbrande also described pure salts of lithium such as the chloride and performed an estimate of its atomic weight in 1855 robert bunsen and augustus matthiessen produced large quantities of the metal by electrolysis of lithium chloride commercial production of lithium metal began in 1923 by the german company metallgesellschaft ag through the electrolysis of a molten mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride
like other alkali metals lithium has a single valence electron which it will readily lose to form a cation indicated by the elements low electronegativity as a result lithium is easily deformed highly reactive and has lower melting and boiling points than most metals these and many other properties attributable to alkali metals weaklyheld valence electron are most distinguished in lithium as it possesses the smallest atomic radius and thus the highest electronegativity of the alkali group in addition lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium an element of similar atomic and ionic radius chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride in n2 the formation of an oxide when burnt in o2 salts with similar solubilities and thermallyunstable carbonates and nitrides
lithium is soft enough to be cut with a knife though this is more difficult than cutting sodium the fresh metal has a silverywhite color which only remains untarnished in dry air
lithium is greatly heatresistant possessing a low coefficient of thermal expansion and the highest specific heat capacity of any solid element lithium has also been found to be superconductive below 400 μk this finding paves the way for further study of superconductivity as lithiums atomic lattice is the simplest of all metals
in moist air lithium metal rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide lioh and liohh2o lithium nitride li3n and lithium carbonate li2co3 the result of a secondary reaction between lioh and cosub2sub
when placed over a flame lithium gives off a striking crimson color but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant white lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapours it is the only metal that reacts with nitrogen at room temperature
lithium metal is flammable and potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially water though it is far less dangerous than other alkali metals in this regard the lithiumwater reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but not violent lithium fires are difficult to extinguish requiring special chemicals designed to smother them see sodium for details
naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes 6li and 7li the latter being the more abundant 925 natural abundance seven radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being 8li with a halflife of 838 ms and 9li with a halflife of 1783nbspms all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are shorter than 86nbspms the shortestlived isotope of lithium is 4li which decays through proton emission and has a halflife of 758043x1023 s
7li is one of the primordial elements or more properly primordial isotopes produced in big bang nucleosynthesis a small amount of 6li is also produced in stars lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes including mineral formation chemical precipitation metabolism and ion exchange lithium ion substitutes for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals where 6li is preferred to 7li resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration
the exotic 11li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo
see also lithium minerals lithium is widely distributed on earth and is the 33rd most abundant element
because of its specific heat capacity the highest of all solids lithium is often used in heat transfer applications
it is an important ingredient in cathode materials used in rechargeable and singleuse batteries because of its high electrochemical potential light weight and high current density
large quantities of lithium are also used in the manufacture of organolithium reagents especially nbutyllithium which has many uses in fine chemical and polymer synthesis
lithium salts were used during the 19th century to treat gout lithium salts such as lithium carbonate li2co3 lithium citrate and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers they are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder since unlike most other mood altering drugs they counteract both mania and depression lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs it is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches
the active principle in these salts is the lithium ion li which having a smaller diameter can easily displace k and na and even ca2 in spite of its greater charge occupying their sites in several critical neuronal enzymes and neurotransmitter receptors although li cannot displace mg2 and zn2 because of these ions small size and greater charge higher charge density hence stronger bonding when mg2 or zn2 are present in low concentrations and li is present in high concentrations the latter can occupy sites normally occupied by mg2 or zn2 in various enzymes therapeutically useful amounts of lithium 06 to 12 mmoll are only slightly lower than toxic amounts 15 mmoll so the blood levels of lithium must be carefully monitored during treatment to avoid toxicity therefore in theory coadministration of 400 iu vitamin d 1 g magnesium citrate not the insoluble oxide or carbonate 15 mg zn as gluconate or piccolinate not the insoluble oxide and 1 pill of vitamin b complex a day should potentiate the effect of li in some cases allowing for the reduction of the therapeutic range to 05 to 09 mmoll of the daily dose of lithium carbonate and of the risk of toxicity
common side effects include muscle tremors twitching ataxia hyperparathyroidism bone loss hypercalcemia hypertension etc kidney damage nephrogenic diabetes insipidus polyuria and polydipsia and seizures many of the sideeffects are a result caused by the increased elimination of potassium
lithium chloride and lithium bromide are extremely hygroscopic and frequently used as desiccants lithium stearate is a common allpurpose hightemperature lubricant lithium is an alloying agent used to synthesize organic compounds lithium is used as a flux to promote the fusing of metals during welding and soldering it also eliminates the forming of oxides during welding by absorbing impurities this fusing quality is also important as a flux for producing ceramics enamels and glass lithium is sometimes used in glasses and ceramics including the glass for the 200inch 508nbspm telescope at mt palomar alloys of the metal with aluminium cadmium copper and manganese are used to make high performance aircraft parts lithium niobate is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators for such components as resonant crystals lithium products are currently used in more than 60 percent of mobile phones the high nonlinearity of lithium niobate also makes a good choice for nonlinear optics applications lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb when bombarded by neutrons both 6li and 7li produce tritium mdashthis reaction which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested was responsible for the runaway yield of the castle bravo nuclear test tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve although details remain secret lithium6 deuteride still apparently plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material metallic lithium and its complex hydrides such as eg li alh4 are considered as high energy additives to rocket propellants 3 lithium peroxide lithium nitrate lithium chlorate and lithium perchlorate are used and thought of as oxidizers in both rocket propellants and oxygen candles to supply submarines and space capsules with oxygen lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined nuclear fusion reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel tritium does not occur naturally and will be produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a blanket containing lithium where neutrons from the deuteriumtritium reaction in the plasma will react with the lithium to produce more tritium 6li n 4he 3h various means of doing this will be tested at the iter reactor being built at cadarache france lithium is used as a source for alpha particles or helium nuclei when 7li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8 be is formed which undergoes spontaneous fission to form two alpha particles this was the first manmade nuclear reaction produced by cockroft and walton in 1929 lithium hydroxide lioh is an important compound of lithium obtained from lithium carbonate li2co3 it is a strong base and when heated with a fat it produces a lithium soap lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils and so is used commercially to manufacture lubricating greases it is also an efficient and lightweight purifier of air in confined areas such as aboard spacecraft and submarines the concentration of carbon dioxide can approach unhealthy or toxic levels lithium hydroxide absorbs the carbon dioxide from the air by reacting with it to form lithium carbonate any alkali hydroxide will absorb co2 but lithium hydroxide is preferred especially in spacecraft applications because of the low formula weight conferred by the lithium even better materials for this purpose include lithium peroxide li2o2 that in presence of moisture not only absorb carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate but also release oxygen eg 2 li2o2 2 co2 2 li2co3 o2 lithium metal is used as a reducing agent in some types of methamphetamine production particularly in illegal amateur meth labs
since the end of world war ii lithium metal production has greatly increased the metal is separated from other elements in igneous mineral such as those above and is also extracted from the water of mineral springs
the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium and potassium chloride in 1998 it was about us 43 per pound 95 per kg
chile is currently the leading lithium metal producer in the world with argentina next both countries recover the lithium from brine pools in the united states lithium is similarly recovered from brine pools in nevada
china may emerge as a significant producer of brinebased lithium carbonate towards the end of this decade potential capacity of up to 45000 tonnes per year could come onstream if projects in qinghai province and tibet proceed
lithium metal due to its alkaline tarnish is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds which are often alkaline can irritate the nose and throat higher exposure to lithium can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs leading to pulmonary edema the metal itself is usually less a handling hazard than the caustic hydroxide produced when it is in contact with moisture lithium should be stored in a nonreactive compound such as naphtha or a hydrocarbon
some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries which are the most readily available source of lithium metal for ordinary consumers lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the birch reduction method which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia however the effectiveness of such restrictions in controlling illegal production of methamphetamine remains indeterminate and controversial
carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation particularly aircraft because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when shortcircuited leading to overheating and possible explosion however most consumer lithium batteries have thermal overload protection builtin to prevent this type of incident or their design inherently limits shortcircuit currents

lanthanum is a silvery white metallic element that belongs to group 3 of the periodic table and is a lanthanide found in some rareearth minerals usually in combination with cerium and other rare earth elements lanthanum is malleable ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife it is one of the most reactive of the rareearth metals the metal reacts directly with elemental carbon nitrogen boron selenium silicon phosphorus sulfur and with halogens it oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air cold water attacks lanthanum slowly while hot water attacks it much more rapidly
uses of lanthanum carbon lighting applications especially by the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projection lasub2subosub3sub improves the alkali resistance of glass and is used in making special optical glasses such as infrared absorbing glass camera and telescope lenses because of the high refractive index and low dispersion of rareearth glasses small amounts of lanthanum added to steel improves its malleability resistance to impact and ductility small amounts of lanthanum added to iron helps to produce nodular cast iron small amounts of lanthanum added to molybdenum decreases the hardness of this metal and its sensitivity to temperature variations small amounts of lanthanum are present in many pool products to remove the phosphates that feed algae mischmetal a pyrophoric alloy used eg in lighter flints contains 25 to 45 lanthanum lanthanum oxide and the boride are used in electronic vacuum tubes as hot cathode materials with strong emissivity of electrons crystals of labsub6sub are used in high brightness extended life thermionic electron emission sources for scanning electron microscopes in gas tungsten arc welding electrodes as a substitute for radioactive thorium hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum these alloys are capable of storing up to 400 times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process petroleum cracking catalysts gas lantern mantles glass and lapidary polishing compound laba age dating of rocks and ores lanthanum carbonate is used medically as a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia see details below under biological role lanthanum nitrate is mainly applied in specialty glass water treatment and catalyst cerium activated lanthanum bromide is the recent inorganic scintillator which has a combination of high light yield and the best energy resolution like horseradish peroxidase lanthanum is used as an electrondense tracer in molecular biology
lanthanum was discovered in 1839 by swedish chemist carl gustav mosander when he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by heating and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid from the resulting solution he isolated a new rare earth he called lantana lanthanum was isolated in relatively pure form in 1923
the word lanthanum comes from the greek λανθανω lanthanō to lie hidden
lanthanum is the most strongly basic of all the trivalent lanthanides and this property is what allowed mosander to isolate and purify the salts of this element basicity separation as operated commercially involved the fractional precipitation of the weaker bases such as didymium from nitrate solution by the addition of magnesium oxide or dilute ammmonia gas purified lanthanum remained in solution the basicity methods were only suitable for lanthanum purification didymium could not be efficiently further separated in this manner the alternative technique of fractional crystallization was invented by dimitry mendeleev himself in the form of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrate which he used to separate the lesssoluble lanthanum from the moresoluble didymium in the 1870s this system would be used commercially in lanthanum purification until the development of practical solvent extraction methods that started in the late 1950s a detailed process using the double ammonium nitrates to provide 4n pure lanthanum neodymium concentrates and praseodymium concentrates is presented in callow 1967 at a time when the process was just becoming obsolete as operated for lanthanum purification the double ammonium nitrates were recrystallized from water when later adapted by carl auer von welsbach for the splitting of didymium nitric acid was used as solvent to lower the solubility of the system lanthanum is relatively easy to purify since it has only one adjacent lanthanide cerium which itself is very readily removed due to its potential tetravalency
lanthanum has no known biological role the element is not absorbed orally and when injected its elimination is very slow lanthanum carbonate was approved as a medication fosrenol shire pharmaceuticals to absorb excess phosphate in cases of endstage renal failure some rareearth chlorides such as lanthanum chloride lacl3 are known to have anticoagulant properties
while lanthanum has pharmacological effects on several receptors and ion channels its specificity for the gaba receptor is unique among divalent cations lanthanum acts at the same modulatory site on the gabar as zinc a known negative allosteric modulator the lanthanum cation la3 is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant gaba receptors increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner
although lanthanum belongs to chemical elements group called rare earth metals it is not rare at all lanthanum is available in relatively large quantities 32 ppm in earths crust rare earths got their name since they were indeed rare as compared to the common earths such as lime or magnesia and historically only a few deposits were known
monazite ce la th nd ypo4 and bastnasite ce la yco3f are the principal ores in which lanthanum occurs in percentages of up to 25 to 38 percent of the total lanthanide content lanthanum is more generally enriched in bastnasite as opposed to monazite in commercial orebodies until 1949 bastnasite was a rare and obscure mineral not even remotely contemplated as a potential commercial source for lanthanides in that year the vast deposit at mountain pass california was discovered this discovery alerted geologists as to the existence of a whole new class of rare earth deposit the rareearth bearing carbonatite other examples of which soon surfaced particularly in africa and china

lutetium is a silvery white corrosion resistant trivalent metal that is relatively stable in air lutetium is the heaviest and hardest of the rare earth elements lutetium has the highest melting point of any lanthanide probably related to the lanthanide contraction
this element is very expensive to obtain in useful quantities and therefore it has very few commercial uses however stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation hydrogenation and polymerization applications

lutetium latin lutetia meaning paris was independently discovered in 1907 by french scientist georges urbain austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach and american chemist charles james all men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia which was thought by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac and most others to consist entirely of the element ytterbium
the separation of lutetium from marignacs ytterbium was first described by urbain and the naming honor therefore went to him he chose the names neoytterbium new ytterbium and lutecium for the new element but neoytterbium was eventually reverted back to ytterbium and in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium
welsbach proposed the names cassiopium for element 71 after the constellation cassiopeia and aldebaranium for the new name of ytterbium but these naming proposals where rejected although many german scientists in the 1950s called the element 71 cassiopium
found with almost all other rareearth metals but never by itself lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements consequently it is also one of the most expensive metals costing about six times as much as gold
the principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite ce la etc p o 4 which contains 0003 of the element pure lutetium metal has only relatively recently been isolated and is very difficult to prepare thus it is one of the most rare and expensive of the rare earth metals it is separated from other rare earth elements by ion exchange and then obtained in the elemental form by reduction of anhydrous lu cl 3 or lu f 3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal

the appearance of this element is unknown however it is most likely silverywhite or gray and metallic if sufficient amounts of lawrencium were produced it would pose a radiation hazard very little is known about the chemical properties of this element but some preliminary work on a few atoms has indicated that it behaves similarly to other actinides
a strict correlation between periodic table blocks and chemical series for neutral atoms would describe lawrencium as a transition metal because it is in the fblock but it is an actinide according to iupac
lawrencium was discovered by albert ghiorso torbjørn sikkeland almon larsh and robert m latimer on february 14 1961 at the lawrence radiation laboratory now called lawrence berkeley national laboratory on the university of california berkeley campus it was produced by bombarding a three milligram target composed of three isotopes of californium with boron 10 and b11 ions in the heavy ion linear accelerator hilac
the transmutation nuclei became electrically charged recoiled with a helium atmosphere and were collected on a thin copper conveyor tape this tape was then moved in order to place the collected atoms in front of a series of solidstate detectors the berkeley team reported that the isotope 257103 was detected in this manner and decayed by emitting an 86 mev alpha particle with a halflife of 42 seconds
in 1967 researchers in dubna russia reported that they were not able to confirm an alpha emitter with a halflife of 42 seconds as 257103 this assignment has since been changed to 258lr or 259lr eleven isotopes of element 103 have been synthesized with 262lr being the longest lived with a halflife of 216 minutes the isotopes of lawrencium decay via alpha emission spontaneous fission and electron capture in order of most to least common types
the origin of the name preferred by the american chemical society is in reference to ernest o lawrence inventor of the cyclotron the symbol lw originally was used but in 1963 it was changed to lr in august 1997 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ratified the name lawrencium and symbol lr during a meeting in geneva unniltrium symbol unt was sometimes used as a temporary systematic element name until that time lawrencium also has been called eka lutetium

lead has a dull luster and is a dense ductile very soft highly malleable bluishwhite metal that has poor electrical conductivity this true metal is highly resistant to corrosion and because of this property it is used to contain corrosive liquids eg sulfuric acid lead can be toughened by adding a small amount of antimony or other metals to it it is the only metal in which there is zero thomson effect all lead except 204pb is the end product of a complex radioactive decay see isotopes of lead below lead is also poisonous
lead has been commonly used for thousands of years because it is widespread easy to extract and easy to work with it is highly malleable and ductile as well as easy to smelt in the early bronze age lead was used with antimony and arsenic lead was mentioned in the book of exodus 1510 in alchemy lead was thought to be the oldest metal and was associated with the planet saturn lead pipes that bear the insignia of roman emperors are still in service and many roman pigs ingots of lead figure in derbyshire lead mining history and in the history of the industry in other english centres leads symbol pb is an abbreviation of its latin name plumbum for soft metals originally it was plumbum nigrum where plumbum candidum was tin the english word plumbing also derives from this latin root
lead also refers collectively to the organic and inorganic compounds of lead which are toxic lead poisoning was documented in ancient rome greece and china in the 20th century the use of lead in paint pigments was sharply reduced because of the danger of lead poisoning especially to children by the mid1980s a significant shift in lead enduse patterns had taken place much of this shift was a result of the us lead consumers compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in nonbattery products including gasoline paints solders and water systems lead use is being further curtailed by the european unions rohs directive lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware vinyl such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords and brass manufactured in china around 20062007 many childrens toys made in china had been recalled due to lead in paint used to color the product
metallic lead does occur in nature but it is rare lead is usually found in ore with zinc silver and most abundantly copper and is extracted together with these metals the main lead mineral is galena pbs which contains 866 lead other common varieties are cerussite pbco3 and anglesite pbso4
lead ore galena is found commonly in northeast wales the northeast wales orefield was by far the most important source of lead and zinc in wales and second in national importance only to the north pennine orefield lead mining dates back to at least roman times and continued until well into the 20th century galena is present in steeply dipping fissure veins and in pipes and is in mississippi valleytype leadzincfluorite and copperdolomite associations the mineralisation occurs in the upper parts of the loggerheads and cefn mawr formations of the carboniferous limestone
the principal ores of lead are galena pbs anglesite pbso4 and cerussite pbco3 most ores contain less than 10 lead and ores containing as little as 3 lead can be economically exploited ores are crushed and concentrated by froth flotation typically to 70 or more sulfide ores are roasted producing primarily lead oxide and a mixture of sulfates and silicates of lead and other metals contained in the ore
lead oxide from the roasting process is reduced in a cokefired blast furnace this converts most of the lead to its metallic form three additional layers separate in the process and float to the top of the metallic lead these are slag silicates containing 15 lead matte sulfides containing 15 lead and speiss arsenides of iron and copper these wastes contain concentrations of copper zinc cadmium and bismuth that can be recovered economically as can their content of unreduced lead
metallic lead that results from the roasting and blast furnace processes still contains significant contaminants of arsenic antimony bismuth zinc copper silver and gold the melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air steam and sulfur which oxidizes the contaminants except silver gold and bismuth the oxidized contaminants are removed by drossing where they float to the top and are skimmed off
most lead ores contain significant concentrations of silver resulting in the smelted metal also containing silver as a contaminant metallic silver as well as gold is removed and recovered economically by means of the parkes process
desilvered lead is freed of bismuth according to the bettertonkroll process by treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium which forms a bismuth dross that can be skimmed off
very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electolytically by means of the betts process the process uses anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead in an electrolyte of silica fluoride
worldwide production and consumption of lead is increasing total annual production is about 8 million tonnes about half is produced from recycled scrap the main countries are australia china and the us which account for more than half of primary production the most common lead ore is galena or lead sulfide annual metal production 2006 7918 thousand tonnes annual mine production 2006 3442 thousand tonnes lead content
at current use rates the supply of lead is estimated to run out in 42 years environmental analyst lester brown however has suggested lead could run out within 18 years based on a reasonable extrapolation of 2 growth per year
lead has four stable isotopes 204pb 206pb 207pb 208pb and one common radiogenic isotope 202pb with a halflife of 53000 years
lead is a poisonous metal that can damage nervous connections especially in young children and cause blood and brain disorders long term exposure to lead or its salts especially soluble salts or the strong oxidant pbo2 can cause nephropathy and colic like abdominal pains the concern about leads role in cognitive deficits in children has brought about widespread reduction in its use lead exposure has been linked to schizophrenia most cases of adult elevate blood lead levels are workplacerelated
older houses may still contain substantial amounts of lead paint white lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries but the yellow lead chromate is still in use for example holland colours holcolan yellow old paint should not be stripped by sanding as this produces inhalable dust
lead salts used in pottery glazes have on occasion caused poisoning when acid drinks such as fruit juices have leached lead ions out of the glaze it has been suggested that what was known as devon colic arose from the use of leadlined presses to extract apple juice in the manufacture of cider lead is considered to be particularly harmful for womens ability to reproduce for that reason many universities do not hand out leadcontaining samples to women for instructional laboratory analyses lead acetate also known as sugar of lead was used by the roman empire as a sweetener for wine and some consider this to be the cause of the dementia that affected many of the roman emperors
lead as a soil contaminant is a widespread issue since lead is present in natural deposits and may also enter soil through leaded gasoline leaks from underground storage tanks or through a wastestream of lead paint or lead grindings from certain industrial operations
in medicine lead inhibits αaminolevulinate ala dehydratase and ferrochelatase preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin ix the final step in heme synthesis inhibition of both these steps results in ineffective heme synthesis and subsequent microcytic hemoglobin poor anemia
alignright in a pourbaix diagram the acidity is plotted on the x axis using the ph scale while how oxidisingreducing nature of the system is plotted on the y axis in terms of volts relative to the standard hydrogen electrode the diagram shows the form of the element which is most chemically stable at each point it only comments on thermodynamics and it says nothing about the rate of change kinetics
various oxidized forms of lead are easily reduced to the metal an example is heating pbo with mild organic reducing agents such as glucose a mixture of the oxide and the sulfide heated together without any reducing agent will also form the metal
2pbo pbs nbsp nbsp 3 pb so2
metallic lead is attacked only superficially by air forming a thin layer of oxide that protects it from further oxidation the metal is not attacked by sulfuric or hydrochloric acids it does however dissolve in nitric acid with the evolution of nitric oxide gas to form dissolved pbnosub3subsub2sub
3 pb 8 h 8 no3 nbsp nbsp 3 pb2 6 no3 2 no 4h2o
when heated with nitrates of alkali metals metallic lead oxidizes to form pbo also known as litharge leaving the corresponding alkali nitrite pbo is representative of leads ii oxidation state it is soluble in nitric and acetic acids from which solutions it is possible to precipitate halide sulfate chromate carbonate pbco3 and basic carbonate pb3oh2co32 salts of lead the sulfide can also be precipitated from acetate solutions these salts are all poorly soluble in water among the halides the iodide is less soluble than the bromide which in turn is less soluble than the chloride
the ii oxide is also soluble in alkali hydroxide solutions to form the corresponding plumbite salt
pbo 2oh h2o nbsp nbsp pboh42
chlorination of plumbite solutions causes the formation of leads iv oxidation state
pboh42 cl2 nbsp nbsp pbo2 2 cl 2 h2o
lead dioxide is representative of the iv state and is a powerful oxidizing agent the chloride of this oxidation state is formed only with difficulty and decomposes readily into the ii chloride and chlorine gas the bromide and iodide of iv lead are not known to exist
pbo2 2 oh 2 h2o nbsp nbsp pboh62
lead also has an oxide that is a hybrid between the ii and iv oxidation states red lead also called minium is pb3o4
lead readily forms an equimolar alloy with sodium metal that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds of lead such as tetraethyl lead
leadii forms a series of complexes with chloride the formation of which alters the corrosion chemistry of the lead this will tend to limit the solubility of lead in saline media
alignright leadii sulfate is poorly soluble as can be seen in the following diagram showing addition of so42 to a solution containing 01m of pb2 the ph of the solution is 45 as above that pb2 concentration can never reach 01m due to the formation of pboh2 observe that pb2 solubility drops 10000 fold as so42 reaches 01m
alignright here it can be seen that the addition of chloride can lower the solubility of lead however in chloride rich media such as aqua regia the lead can become soluble again as anionic chlorocomplexes
the pourbaix diagram on the right is for a moderate concentration 01 m of chloride
lead is a major constituent of the leadacid battery used extensively in car batteries lead is used as a coloring element in ceramic glazes notably in the colors red and yellow lead is used to form glazing bars for stained glass or other multilit windows the practice has become less common not for danger but for stylistic reasons lead is used as projectiles for firearms and fishing sinkers because of its density low cost compared to alternative products and ease of use due to relatively low melting point lead or sheetlead is used as a sound deadening layer in such areas as wall floor and ceiling design in sound studios where levels of airborne and mechanically produced sound are targeted for reduction or virtual elimination lead is used in some candles to treat the wick to ensure a longer more even burn because of the dangers european and north american manufacturers use more expensive alternatives such as zinc lead is used as shielding from radiation molten lead is used as a coolant eg for lead cooled fast reactors lead glass is composed of 1228 lead oxide it changes the optical characteristics of the glass and reduces the transmission of radiation lead is the traditional base metal of organ pipes mixed with varying amounts of tin to control the tone of the pipe lead is used as electrodes in the process of electrolysis lead is used in solder for electronics although this usage is being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally unfriendly waste lead is used in high voltage power cables as sheathing material to prevent water diffusion into insulation lead is used for the ballast keel of sailboats its high weighttovolume ratio allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails while at the same time occupying a small volume and thus offering the least underwater resistance lead is added to brass to reduce machine tool wear lead sheets are used as roofing material lead is frequently used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the divers natural buoyancy and that of his equipment lead is often used to balance the wheels of a car this use is being phased out in favor of other materials for environmental reasons lead is still widely used in statues and sculptures
lead was used as a pigment in lead paint for white as well as yellow and red colors it was discontinued because of the dangers of lead poisoning however lead chromate is still in use lead was the hot metal used in hot metal typesetting lead was used for plumbing in ancient rome lead was used as a preservative for food and drink in ancient rome lead was used for joining cast iron water pipes and used as a material for small diameter water pipes until the early 1970s tetraethyl lead was used in leaded fuels to reduce engine knocking however this is no longer common practice in the western world due to health concerns lead was used to make bullets for slings lead was used as a component of toys due to toy safety regulations this use has been stopped in the united states lead was used in car body filler which was used in many custom cars in the 1940s60s hence the term leadsled lead is a superconductor at 72 k and ibm tried to make a josephson effect computer out of leadalloy

the name originates from the greek word for a district in thessaly called magnesia it is related to magnetite and manganese which also originated from this area and required differentiation as separate substances see manganese for this history
magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earths crust it is found in large deposits of magnesite dolomite and other minerals and in mineral waters where magnesium ion is soluble in 1618 a farmer at epsom in england attempted to give his cows water from a well this they refused to drink because of the waters bitter taste however the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes the fame of epsom salts spread eventually they were recognized to be hydrated magnesium sulphate mgso4
sir humphry davy electrolytically isolated pure magnesium metal in 1808 from a mix of magnesia and hg o and a a b bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831 davys first suggestion for a name was magnium but the name magnesium is now used
although magnesium is found in over 60 minerals only dolomite magnesite brucite carnallite talc and olivine are of commercial importance
in the united states this metal is principally obtained by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brines wells and sea water cathode mg2 2 e mg anode 2 cl cl2 gas 2 e the united states has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal supplying 45 of world production even as recently as 1995 today the us market share is at 7 with a single domestic producer left us magnesium a company born from nowdefunct magcorp as of 2005 china has taken over as the dominant supplier pegged at 60 world market share which increased from 4 in 1995 unlike the above described electrolytic process china is almost completely reliant on a different method of obtaining the metal from its ores the silicothermic pidgeon process the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon

magnesium ions are essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of life and thus are essential to all cells of all known living organisms plants have an additional use for magnesium in that chlorophylls are magnesiumcentered porphyrins many enzymes require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action especially enzymes utilizing atp or those which use other nucleotides to synthesize dna and rna magnesium deficiency in plants causes lateseason yellowing between leaf veins especially in older leaves and can be corrected by applying epsom salts which is rapidly leached or else crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil
magnesium is a vital component of a healthy human diet and deficiency has been implicated in a number of human diseases magnesium is readily available in many common foods but studies indicate that many americans are magnesium deficient excess magnesium in the blood is freely filterd at the kidneys and for this reason it is very difficult to overdose on magnesium from dietary sources alone however there are a number of magnesium supplements available which make overdose possible particularly in people with poor renal function
magnesium has three stable isotopes 24mg 25mg 26mg all are present in significant amounts see table of isotopes above about 79 of mg is 24mg the isotope 28mg is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was made commercially by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments this isotope has a relatively short halflife 21 hours and so its use was limited by shipping times
26mg has found application in isotopic geology similar to that of aluminium 26mg is a radiogenic daughter product of 26al which has a halflife of 717000 years large enrichments of stable 26mg have been observed in the caalrich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites the anomalous abundance of 26mg is attributed to the decay of its parent 26al in the inclusions therefore the meteorite must have formed in the solar nebula before the 26al had decayed hence these fragments are among the oldest objects in the solar system and have preserved information about its early history
it is conventional to plot 26mg24mg against an almg ratio in an isochron dating plot the almg ratio plotted is27al24mg the slope of the isochron has no age significance but indicates the initial 26al27al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir
magnesium metal and alloys are highly flammable in their pure form when molten as a powder or in ribbon form burning or molten magnesium metal reacts violently with water magnesium powder is an explosive hazard one should wear safety glasses while working with magnesium and if burning it these should include a heavy uv filter similar to welding eye protection the bright white light including ultraviolet produced by burning magnesium can permanently damage the retinas of the eyes similar to welding arc burns
water should not be used to extinguish magnesium fires because it can produce hydrogen which will feed the fire according to the reaction mg s 2 h2o g mgoh2 s h2 g or in words magnesium solid steam magnesium hydroxide solid hydrogen gas
carbon dioxide fire extinguishers should not be used either because magnesium can burn in carbon dioxide forming magnesium oxide mgo and carbon a class d dry chemical fire extinguisher should be used if available or else the fire should be covered with sand or magnesium foundry flux an easy way to put out small metal fires is to place a polyethylene bag filled with dry sand on top of the fire the heat of the fire will melt the bag and the sand will flow out onto the fire

manganese is a graywhite metal resembling iron it is a hard metal and is very brittle fusible with difficulty but easily oxidized manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic this means that while manganese metal does not form a permanent magnet it does exhibit strong magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field
the most common oxidation states of manganese are 2 3 4 6 and 7 though oxidation states from 1 to 7 are observed mn2 often competes with mg2 in biological systems and manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state 7 are powerful oxidizing agents
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking the manganese in this unusual organometalic compound is in the 1 oxidation state
the most stable oxidation state for manganese is 2 which has a pink to red color and many manganeseii compounds are known such as manganeseii sulfate mnso4 and manganeseii chloride mncl2 this oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite manganeseii carbonate the 2 oxidation state is the state use in living organisms for essential functions all of the other states are much more toxic
the 3 oxidation state is known in compounds such as manganeseiii acetate but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents
manganeseiv oxide manganese dioxide mno2 is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols ie adjacent to an aromatic ring manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidatively neutralize the greenish tinge in glass caused by trace amounts of iron contamination mno2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints in some preparations it is a brown pigment that can be used to make paint and is a constituent of natural umber
manganeseiv oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc and is the blackish material found when opening carbonzinc type flashlight cells the same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries usually battery cells which use the same basic reaction but a different electrolyte mixture
manganese phosphating is used as a treatment for rust and corrosion prevention on steel
permanganate 7 oxidation state manganese compounds are purple and can color glass an amethyst color potassium permanganate sodium permanganate and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers potassium permanganate also called condys crystals is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties and finds use as a topical medicine for example in the treatment of fish diseases solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy
substitutes manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications which are related to metallurgical alloy use in minor applications eg manganese phosphating zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes in disposable battery manufacture standard and alkaline cells using manganese will probably eventually be mostly replaced with lithium battery technology
the overall level and nature of manganese use in the united states is expected to remain about the same in the near term no practical technologies exist for replacing manganese with other materials or for using domestic deposits or other accumulations to reduce the complete dependence of the united states on other countries for manganese ore
manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfurfixing deoxidizing and alloying properties steelmaking including its ironmaking component has accounted for most manganese demand presently in the range of 85 to 90 of the total demand among a variety of other uses manganese is a key component of lowcost stainless steel formulations and certain widely used aluminium alloys
the metal is very occasionally used in coins the only united states coins to use manganese were the wartime nickel from 1942ndash1945 and since 2000 dollar coins the eu uses manganese in 1 and 2 euro coins due to greater and cheaper availability
the origin of the name manganese is complex in ancient times two black minerals from magnesia in what is now modern greece were both called magnes but were thought to differ in gender the male magnes attracted iron and was the iron ore we now know as loadstone or magnetite and which probably gave us the term magnet the female magnes ore did not attract iron but was used to decolorize glass this feminine magnes was later called magnesia known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide this mineral is never magnetic although manganese itself is paramagnetic in the 16th century the latter compound was called manganesum note the two ns instead of one by glassmakers possibly as a corruption of two words since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra the black ore from magnesia alba a white ore also from magnesia also useful in glassmaking mercati called magnesia negra manganesa and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese german mangan the name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba magnesium oxide which provided the name magnesium for that free element when it was eventually isolated much later
manganese compounds were in use in prehistoric times paints that were pigmented with manganese dioxide can be traced back 17000 years the egyptians and romans used manganese compounds in glassmaking to either remove color from glass or add color to it manganese can be found in the iron ores used by the spartans some speculate that the exceptional hardness of spartan steels derives from the inadvertent production of an ironmanganese alloy
in the 17th century german chemist johann glauber first produced permanganate a useful laboratory reagent although some people believe that it was discovered by ignites kaim in 1770 by the mid18th century manganese dioxide was in use in the manufacture of chlorine which it produces when mixed with hydrochloric acid or commercially with a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride the swedish chemist scheele was the first to recognize that manganese was an element and his colleague johan gottlieb gahn isolated the pure element in 1774 by reduction of the dioxide with carbon around the beginning of the 19th century scientists began exploring the use of manganese in steelmaking with patents being granted for its use at the time in 1816 it was noted that adding manganese to iron made it harder without making it any more brittle in 1837 british academic james couper noted an association between heavy exposure to manganese in mines with a form of parkinsons disease in 1912 manganese phosphating electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion were patented in the united states and have seen widespread use ever since
in the 20th century manganese dioxide has seen wide commercial use as the chief cathodic material for commercial disposable dry cells and dry batteries of both the standard carbonzinc and alkaline type
manganese is an essential trace nutrient in all forms of life
the classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad and include such classes as oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases ligases lectins and integrins the reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses though not lentiviruses such as hiv contain manganese the best known manganesecontaining polypeptides may be arginase the diphtheria toxin and mncontaining superoxide dismutase mnsod
mnsod is the type of sod present in eukaryotic mitochondria and also in most bacteria this fact is in keeping with the bacterialorigin theory of mitochondria the mnsod enzyme is probably one of the most ancient for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide formed from the 1electron reduction of dioxygen exceptions include a few kinds of bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism involving manganese mn2 ions complexed with polyphosphate directly for this task indicating how this function possibly evolved in aerobic life
manganese is also important in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants which are also evolutionarily of bacterial origin the oxygen evolving complex oec a wateroxidizing enzyme contained in chloroplast membrane and which is involved in the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese for this reason most broadspectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese
manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite mnosub2sub and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite mncosub3sub landbased resources are large but irregularly distributed those of the united states are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs over 80 of the known world manganese resources are found in south africa and ukraine other important manganese deposits are in china australia brazil gabon india and mexico

see also manganese minerals naturally occurring manganese is composed of 1 stable isotope 55mn 18 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 53mn with a halflife of 37 million years 54mn with a halflife of 3123 days and 52mn with a halflife of 5591 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than 3 hours and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 1 minute this element also has 3 meta states
manganese is part of the iron group of elements which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before supernova explosion 53mn decays to 53 cr with a halflife of 37 million years because of its relatively short halflife 53mn is an extinct radionuclide manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating mncr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26 al and 107 pd for the early history of the solar system variations in 53cr52cr and mncr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial 53mn55mn ratio that suggests mncr isotopic systematics must result from insitu decay of 53mn in differentiated planetary bodies hence 53mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system
the isotopes of manganese range in atomic weight from 46 u 46mn to 65 u 65mn the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 55mn is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay
manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals such as nickel and copper exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5 mgm3 even for short periods because of its toxicity level manganese poses a particular risk for children due to its propensity to bind to ch7 receptors manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders
acidic permanganate solutions will oxidize any organic material they come into contact with the oxidation process can generate enough heat to ignite some organic substances
in 2005 a study suggested a possible link between manganese inhalation and central nervous system toxicity in rats it is hypothesized that longterm exposure to the naturallyoccurring manganese in shower water puts up to 87 million americans at risk
a form of neurodegeneration similar to parkinsons disease called manganism has been linked to manganese exposure amongst miners and smelters since the early 19th century allegations of inhalationinduced manganism have been made regarding the welding industry manganese exposure is regulated by occupational safety and health administration

molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 18 on the pauling scale and an atomic mass of 959nbspgmole it does not react with oxygen or water at room temperature at elevated temperatures molybdenum trioxide is formed in the reaction 2mo 3o2 2moo3
in its pure metal form molybdenum is silvery white and very hard though it is somewhat more ductile than tungsten it has a melting point of 2623c and only tantalum osmium rhenium and tungsten have higher melting points it also has the lowest heating expansion of any commercially used metal
molybdenum has a value of approximately 65000 per tonne as of 4 may 2007 it maintained a price at or near 10000 per tonne from 1997 through 2002 and reached a high of 103000 per tonne in june 2005
there are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum ranging in atomic mass from 83 to 117 as well as four metastable nuclear isomers seven isotopes occur naturally with atomic masses of 92 94 95 96 97 98 and 100 of these naturallyoccurring isotopes five are stable with atomic masses from 94 to 98 all unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium technetium and ruthenium
molybdenum92 and molybdenum100 are the only naturallyoccurring isotopes that are not stable molybdenum100 has a halflife of approximately 11019nbsp y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium 100 molybdenum98 is the most common isotope comprising 2414 of all molybdenum molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have halflives of approximately 15nbspμs
the worlds largest producers of molybdenum materials are the united states canada chile russia and china
though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite pbmo o 4 and powellite camo o 4 the main commercial source of molybdenum is molybdenite mo s 2 molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining
molybdenum is the 42ndmostabundant element in the universe and the 25thmostabundant element in earths oceans with an average of 108nbspmtkm
a side product of molybdenum mining is rhenium as it is always present in small varying quantities in molybdenite the only commercial source for rhenium is molybdenum mines
the most important use of the molybdenum atom in mammals and other animals is in enzymes see below in a 70nbspkg human body there is approximately 93nbspmg molybdenum comprising 00001 of the total body mass it occurs in higher concentrations in the liver and kidneys and in lower concentrations in the vertebrae pork lamb and beef liver each have approximately 15 parts molybdenum per million other significant dietary sources include green beans eggs sunflower seeds wheat flour lentils and cereal grain
the average daily intake of molybdenum is 3nbspmg daily intake above 4nbspmg can be toxic sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues
though molybdenum forms compounds with various organic molecules including carbohydrates and amino acids it is transported throughout the body as moo42 molybdenum is present in approximately 20 enzymes including aldehyde oxidase sulfite oxidase xanthine oxidase
high amounts of molybdenum can interfere with the bodys uptake of copper both by preventing plasma proteins from binding the copper and by increasing the amount of copper that is excreted in urine ruminants that consume high amounts of molybdenum develop symptoms including diarrhea stunted growth anaemia and achromotrichia these symptoms can be alleviated by the administration of more copper into the system both in dietary form and by injection the condition can be aggravated by excess sulfur
the ability of molybdenum to withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening makes it useful in applications that involve intense heat including the manufacture of aircraft parts electrical contacts industrial motors and filaments most highstrength steel alloys are 25 to 8 molybdenum
because of its lower density and more stable price molybdenum is implemented in the place of tungsten
molybdenum disulfide mos2 is used as a lubricant and an agent it forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is highly resistant to both extreme temperatures and high pressure lead molybdate coprecipitated with lead chromate and lead suflate is a brightorange pigment used with ceramics and plastics molybdenum trioxide moo3 is used as an adhesive between enamels and metals
also used in no no2 nox analyzers in power plants for pollution controls at 350 c the element acts as a catalyst for no2nox to form only no molecules for consistent readings by infrared light
molybdenite from the greek μόλυβδος molybdos meaning lead the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted was previously known as molybdena molybdena was confused with and often implemented as though it were graphite even when the two ores were distinguishable molybdena was thought to be a lead ore
it was not until 1778 that swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele realized molybdena was neither graphite nor lead he and other chemists then correctly assumed that it was the ore of a distinct new element named molybdenum for the mineral in which it was discovered peter jacob hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781 for a long time there was no industrial use for molybdenum the french schneider electrics company produced the first steel molybdenum alloy armor plates in 1894 until world war i most other armor factories also used molybdenum alloys in world war i some british tanks were protected by 75nbspmm manganese plating but this proved to be ineffective the manganese plates were then replaced with 25nbspmm molybdenum plating these allowed for higher speed greater manueverability and despite being thinner better protection
molybdenum dusts and fumes as can be generated by mining or metalworking are not toxic there are no longterm effects associated with exposure to molybdenum however prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin the direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum should also be avoided osha regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8hour day to be 5 mgm chronic exposure to 60 to 600 mg mom can cause symptoms including fatigue headaches and joint pains
crow t robot made of molybdenum webelementscom mdash molybdenum international molybdenum association mdash environmental data meitnerium also called eka iridium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol mt and atomic number 109 it is a synthetic element whose most stable isotope is mt276 with a halflife of 720 milliseconds
meitnerium was first synthesized on august 29 1982 by a german research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried münzenberg at the institute for heavy ion research gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung in darmstadt the team bombarded a target of bismuth 209 with accelerated nuclei of iron 58 and isotope meitnerium266 was produced the synthesis of this element demonstrated that nuclear fusion techniques could be used to make new heavy nuclei
the name meitnerium was suggested in honor of the austrian physicist and mathematician lise meitner but there was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus iupac adopted unnilennium symbol une as a temporary systematic element name in 1997 however the dispute was resolved and the current name was adopted
webelementscom meitnerium apsidium meitnerium nitrogen is a chemical element which has the symbol n and atomic number 7 elemental nitrogen is a colorless odorless tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions constituting 781 by volume of earths atmosphere nitrogen is a constituent element of amino acids and therefore of all living organisms many industrially important compounds such as ammonia nitric acid and cyanides contain nitrogen
nitrogen is a nonmetal with an electronegativity of 30 it has five electrons in its outer shell and is therefore trivalent in most compounds the triple bond in molecular nitrogen n2 is one of the strongest in nature the resulting difficulty of converting n2 into other compounds and the ease and associated high energy release of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental n2 have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities
at atmospheric pressure molecular nitrogen condenses liquifies at 77nbsp k 1958nbsp c and freezes at 63nbspk 2100nbspc into the beta hexagonal closepacked crystal allotropic form below 354nbspk 2376nbspc nitrogen assumes the alpha cubic crystal allotropic form liquid nitrogen a fluid resembling water but with 808 of the density is a common cryogen
unstable allotropes of nitrogen consisting of more than two nitrogen atoms have been produced in the laboratory like n3 and nsub4sub under extremely high pressures 11 million atm and high temperatures 2000 k as produced under diamond anvil conditions nitrogen polymerizes into the single bonded diamond crystal structure an allotrope nicknamed nitrogen diamond
nitrogen is the largest single constituent of the earths atmosphere 78082 by volume of dry air 753 by weight in dry air it is created by fusion processes in stars and is estimated to be the 7th most abundant chemical element by mass in the universe
molecular nitrogen and nitrogen compounds have been detected in interstellar space by astronomers using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of the saturnian moon titan s thick atmosphere and occurs in trace amounts in other planetary atmospheres
nitrogen is present in all living organisms in proteins nucleic acids and other molecules it is a large component of animal waste for example guano usually in the form of urea uric acid ammonium compounds and derivatives of these nitrogenous products which are essential nutrients for all plants that are unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen
there are two stable isotopes of nitrogen 14n and 15n by far the most common is 14n 99634 which is produced in the cno cycle in stars and the remaining is 15n of the ten isotopes produced synthetically 13n has a half life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half lives on the order of seconds or less biologicallymediated reactions eg assimilation nitrification and denitrification strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil these reactions typically result in 15n enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product
073 of the molecular nitrogen in earths atmosphere is comprised of the isotopologue 14n15n and almost all the rest is 14n2
molecular nitrogen 14n2 is largely transparent to infrared and visible radiation because it is a homonuclear molecule and thus has no dipole moment to couple to electromagnetic radiation at these wavelengths significant absorption occurs at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths beginning around 100 nanometers this is associated with electronic transitions in the molecule to states in which charge is not distributed evenly between nitrogen atoms nitrogen absorption leads to significant absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the earths upper atmosphere as well as in the atmospheres of other planetary bodies for similar reasons pure molecular nitrogen lasers typically emit light in the ultraviolet range
nitrogen also makes a contribution to visible air glow from the earths upper atmosphere through electron impact excitation followed by emission this visible blue air glow seen in the polar aurora and in the reentry glow of returning spacecraft typically results not from molecular nitrogen but rather from free nitrogen atoms combining with oxygen to form nitric oxide no
nitrogen latin nitrogenium where nitrum from greek nitron means saltpetre see niter and genes means forming is formally considered to have been discovered by daniel rutherford in 1772 who called it noxious air or fixed air that there was a fraction of air that did not support combustion was well known to the late 18th century chemist nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by carl wilhelm scheele henry cavendish and joseph priestley who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air nitrogen gas was inert enough that antoine lavoisier referred to it as azote from the greek word αζωτος meaning lifeless animals died in it and it was the principal component of air in which animals had suffocated and flames had burned to extinction this term has become the french word for nitrogen and later spread out to many other languages
argon was discovered when it was noticed that nitrogen from air is not identical to nitrogen from chemical reactions
compounds of nitrogen were known in the middle ages the alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis strong water the mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia royal water celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold the king of metals the earliest industrial and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds involved uses in the form of saltpeter sodium or potassium nitrate notably in gunpowder and much later as fertilizer
nitrogen gas is acquired for industrial purposes by the fractional distillation of liquid air or by mechanical means using gaseous air ie pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of airprocessing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes
nitrogen gas has a wide variety of applications including serving as an inert replacement for air where oxidation is undesirable to preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage in ordinary incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon on top of liquid explosives for safety measures the production of electronic parts such as transistors diodes and integrated circuits dried and pressurized as a dielectric gas for high voltage equipment the manufacturing of stainless steel use in military aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard see inerting system filling automotive and aircraft tires due to its inertness and lack of moisture or oxidative qualities as opposed to air though this is not necessary for consumer automobiles
nitrogen molecules are less likely to escape from the inside of a tire compared with the traditional air mixture used air consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen nitrogen molecules have a larger effective diameter than oxygen molecules and therefore diffuse through porous substances more slowly
molecular nitrogen a diatomic gas is apt to dimerize into a linear four nitrogen long polymer this is an important phenomenon for understanding highvoltage nitrogen dielectric switches because the process of polymerization can continue to lengthen the molecule to still longer lengths in the presence of an intense electric field a nitrogen polymer fog is thereby created the second virial coefficient of nitrogen also shows this effect as the compressibility of nitrogen gas is changed by the dimerization process at moderate and low temperatures
nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns the downside is that nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than co2 making n2 tanks heavier and more expensive
a further example of its versatility is its use as a preferred alternative to carbon dioxide to pressurize kegs of some beers particularly stouts and british ales due to the smaller bubbles it produces which make the dispensed beer smoother and headier a modern application of a pressure sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a widget now allows nitrogen charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles
liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid at atmospheric pressure it boils at minus1965 c when insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks it can be transported without much evaporative losses
like dry ice the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a refrigerant among other things it is used in the cryopreservation of blood reproductive cells sperm and egg and other biological samples and materials it is also used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment it has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers which are overclocked and which produce more heat than during normal operation
nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids and nucleic acids both of which are essential to all life on earth
molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals and needs to be converted into nitrogen compounds or fixed in order to be used by life precipitation often contains substantial quantities of ammonium and nitrate both thought to be a result of nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena however because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate most of the fixed nitrogen that reaches the soil surface under trees is in the form of nitrate soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium
specific bacteria eg rhizobium trifolium possess nitrogenase enzymes which can fix atmospheric nitrogen see nitrogen fixation into a form ammonium ion which is chemically useful to higher organisms this process requires a large amount of energy and anoxic conditions such bacteria may be free in the soil eg azotobacter but normally exist in a symbiotic relationship in the root nodules of leguminous plants eg clover trifolium species or the soya bean plant glycine max nitrogenfixing bacteria can be symbiotic with a number of unrelated plant species common examples are legumes alders alnus spp lichens casuarina myrica liverworts and gunnera
as part of the symbiotic relationship the plant subsequently converts the ammonium ion to nitrogen oxides and amino acids to form proteins and other biologically useful molecules such as alkaloids in return for the usable fixed nitrogen the plant secretes sugars to the symbiotic bacteria
some plants are able to assimilate nitrogen directly in the form of nitrates which may be present in soil from natural mineral deposits artificial fertilizers animal waste or organic decay as the product of bacteria but not bacteria specifically associated with the plant nitrates absorbed in this fashion are converted to nitrites by the enzyme nitrate reductase and then converted to ammonia by another enzyme called nitrite reductase
nitrogen compounds are basic building blocks in animal biology animals use nitrogencontaining amino acids from plant sources as starting materials for all nitrogencompound animal biochemistry including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids some plantfeeding insects are so dependent on nitrogen in their diet that varying the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a plant can affect the rate of reproduction of the insects feeding on it
soluble nitrate is an important limiting factor in the growth of certain bacteria in ocean waters in many places in the world artificial fertilizers applied to croplands to increase yields result in runoff delivery of soluble nitrogen to oceans at river mouths this process can result in eutrophication of the water as nitrogendriven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die wellknown dead zone areas in the us gulf coast and the black sea are due to this important polluting process
many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odor in unfresh saltwater fish pmid 15186102 in animals the free radical molecule nitric oxide no which is derived from an amino acid serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation
animal metabolism of no results in production of nitrite animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins generally results in excretion of urea while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid the characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by nitrogencontaining longchain amines such as putrescine and cadaverine
decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere as molecular nitrogen
nitrogen is generally considered unreactive n2 reacts spontaneously with few reagents being resilient to acids and bases as well as oxidants and most reductants it does however react with elemental lithium at 1 atmosphre and room temperature lithium burns in an atmosphere of n2 to give lithium nitride 6 li n2 2 li3n magnesium also reacts in a similar manner forming magnesium nitride 3 mg n2 mg3n2 n2 forms a variety of adducts with transition metals the first example of a dinitrogen complex is runh35n2 2 see figure at right such compounds are now numerous other examples include ircln2pph32 wn22 phsub2subchsub2subchsub2subpphsub2sub 2 and η5c5me4h2zr 2 μ 2 η ηn2 these complexes illustrate how n2 might bind to the metals in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the haberbosch process a catalytic process to reduce n2 to ammonia with the use of a molybdenum complex in the presence of a proton source was published in 2005
certain other flammable metals eg magnesium will also react with nitrogen gas especially at high temperatures or when the metal has already been ignited before the nitrogen atmosphere is introduced

the main neutral hydride of nitrogen is ammonia n h 3 although hydrazine n2h4 is also commonly used ammonia is more basic than water by 6 orders of magnitude in solution ammonia forms the ammonium ion nh4 liquid ammonia bp 240 k is amphiprotic displaying either brønstedlowry acidic or basic character and forms ammonium and the less common amide ions nh2 both amides and nitride n3 salts are known but decompose in water singly doubly triply and quadruply substituted alkyl compounds of ammonia are called amines four substitutions to form commercially and biologically important quarternary amines results in a positively charged nitrogen and thus a watersoluble or at least amphiphilic compound larger chains rings and structures of nitrogen hydrides are also known but are generally unstable n22 is another polyatomic cation as in hydrazine
other classes of nitrogen anions negatively charged ions are the poisonous azides n3 which are linear and isoelectronic to carbon dioxide but which bind to important ironcontaining enzymes in the body in a manner more resembling cyanide another molecule of the same structure is the colorless and relatively inert anesthetic gas dinitrogen monoxide n2 o also known as laughing gas this is one of a variety of oxides the most prominent of which are nitrogen monoxide no known more commonly as nitric oxide in biology a natural free radical molecule used by the body as a signal for shortterm control of smooth muscle in the circulation another notable nitrogen oxide compound a family often abbreviated nox is the reddish and poisonous nitrogen dioxide no2 which also contains an unpaired electron and is an important component of smog nitrogen molecules containing unpaired electrons show an understandable tendency to dimerize thus pairing the electrons and are generally highly reactive
the more standard oxides dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and dinitrogen pentoxide n2o5 are actually fairly unstable and explosive a tendency which is driven by the stability of n2 as a product the corresponding acids are nitrous hno2 and nitric acid hno3 with the corresponding salts called nitrites and nitrates nitric acid is one of the few acids stronger than hydronium and is a fairly strong oxidizing agent
nitrogen can also be found in organic compounds common nitrogen functional groups include amines amides nitro groups imines and enamines the amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the kjeldahl method
molecular nitrogen n2 in the atmosphere is relatively nonreactive due to its strong bond and n2 plays an inert role in the human body being neither produced or destroyed in nature nitrogen is converted into biologically and industrially useful compounds by some living organisms notably certain bacteria ie nitrogen fixing bacteria see biological role above molecular nitrogen is also released into the atmosphere in the process of decay in dead plant and animal tissues the ability to combine or fix molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry where nitrogen and natural gas are converted into ammonia via the haber process ammonia in turn can be used directly primarily as a fertilizer and in the synthesis of nitrated fertilizers or as a precursor of many other important materials including explosives largely via the production of nitric acid by the ostwald process
the organic and inorganic salts of nitric acid have been important historically as stores of chemical energy they include important compounds such as potassium nitrate or saltpeter used in gunpowder and ammonium nitrate an important fertilizer and explosive see anfo various other nitrated organic compounds such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene and nitrocellulose are used as explosives and propellants for modern firearms nitric acid is used as an oxidizing agent in liquid fueled rockets hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives find use as rocket fuels and monopropellants in most of these compounds the basic instability and tendency to burn or explode is derived from the fact that nitrogen is present as an oxide and not as the far more stable nitrogen molecule n2 which is a product of the compounds thermal decomposition when nitrates burn or explode the formation of the powerful triple bond in the n2 which results produces most of the energy of the reaction
nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major drug class in pharmacology and medicine nitrous oxide n2o was discovered early in the 19th century to be a partial anesthetic though it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until later called laughing gas it was found capable of inducing a state of social disinhibition resembling drunkenness other notable nitrogencontaining drugs are drugs derived from plant alkaloids such as morphine there exist many alkaloids known to have pharmacological effects in some cases they appear natural chemical defences of plants against predation nitrogen containing drugs include all of the major classes of antibiotics and organic nitrate drugs like nitroglycerin and nitroprusside which regulate blood pressure and heart action by mimicking the action of nitric oxide
rapid release of nitrogen gas into an enclosed space can displace oxygen and therefore represents an asphyxiation hazard this may happen with few warning symptoms since the human carotid body is a relatively slow and a poor lowoxygen hypoxia sensing system an example occurred shortly before the launch of the first space shuttle mission in 1981 when two technicians lost consciousness and died after they walked into a space located in the shuttles mobile launcher platform that was pressurized with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire the technicians would have been able to exit the room if they had experienced early symptoms from nitrogenbreathing
when inhaled at high partial pressures more than about 3 atmospheres encountered at depths below about 30 m in scuba diving nitrogen begins to act as an anesthetic agent it can cause nitrogen narcosis a temporary semianesthetized state of mental impairment similar to that caused by nitrous oxide
nitrogen also dissolves in the bloodstream and body fats and rapid decompression particularly in the case of divers ascending too quickly or astronauts decompressing too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness formerly known as caisson sickness or more commonly the bends when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream nerves joints and other sensitive or vital areas
direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen causes severe frostbite cryogenic burns within seconds though not instantly on contact depending on form of liquid nitrogen liquid vs mist and surface area of the nitrogensoaked material soaked clothing or cotton causing more rapid damage than a spill of direct liquid to skin which for a few seconds is protected by the leidenfrost effect

neon greek νέονneon meaning new one was discovered in 1898 by scottish chemist william ramsay 1852 1916 and english chemist morris w travers in london england neon was discovered when ramsay chilled a sample of the atmosphere until it became a liquid then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off the three gases were krypton xenon and neon
neon has three stable isotopes 20ne 9048 21ne 027 and 22ne 925 21ne and 22ne are nucleogenic and their variations are well understood in contrast 20ne is not known to be nucleogenic and the causes of its variation in the earth have been hotly debated the principal nuclear reactions which generate neon isotopes are neutron emission alpha decay reactions on 24mg and 25mg which produce 21ne and 22ne respectively the alpha particles are derived from uranium series decay chains while the neutrons are mostly produced by secondary reactions from alpha particles the net result yields a trend towards lower 20ne22ne and higher 21ne22ne ratios observed in uraniumrich rocks such as granites isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic production of 21ne this isotope is generated by spallation reactions on magnesium sodium silicon and aluminium by analyzing all three isotopes the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon this suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surficial rocks and meteorites
similar to xenon neon content observed in samples of volcanic gases are enriched in 20ne as well as nucleogenic 21ne relative to 22ne content the neon isotopic content of these mantlederived samples represent a nonatmospheric source of neon the 20neenriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components in the earth possibly representing solar neon elevated 20ne abundances are found in diamonds further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the earth
neon is the secondlightest noble gas glows reddish orange in a vacuum discharge tube and has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen on a per unit volume basis in most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium neon plasma has the most intense light discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the rare gases the average color of this light to the human eye is redorange it contains a strong green line which is hidden unless the visual components are dispersed by a spectroscope
neon is actually abundant on a universal scale the fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium oxygen and carbon see chemical element its relative rarity on earth like that of helium is due to its relative lightness and chemical inertness both properties keeping it from being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds of the formation of smaller and warmer solid planets like earth mass abundance in the universe is about 1 part in 750 and in the sun and presumably in the protosolar system nebula about 1 part in 600 the galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found that even in the upper atmosphere of jupiter neon is reduced by about a factor of 10 to 1 part in 6000 by mass this may indicate that even the iceplanetesmals which brought neon into jupiter from the outer solar system formed in a region which was too warm for them to have kept their neon abundances of heavier inert gases on jupiter are several times that found in the sun
neon is a monatomic gas at standard conditions neon is rare on earth found in the earths atmosphere at 1 part in 65000 by volume or 1 part in 83000 by mass it is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air
the reddishorange color that neon emits in neon lights is widely used to make advertising signs and is used in long tubular strips in car modification the word neon is used generically for these types of lights even though many other gases are used to produce different colors of light
neon may also be used in vacuum tubes highvoltage indicators lightning arrestors wave meter tubes television tubes and heliumneon lasers liquefied neon is commercially used as a cryogenic refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more expensive liquid helium refrigeration
neons triple point temperature of 245561 k is a defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of 1990

nickel is a silvery white metal that takes on a high polish it belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile it occurs most usually in combination with sulfur and iron in pentlandite with sulfur in millerite with arsenic in the mineral nickeline and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel glance
it is clear that in common with massive forms of chromium aluminium and titanium metal that nickel is very slow to react with air but it is a very reactive element
because of its permanence in air and its inertness to oxidation it is used in coins for plating iron brass etc for chemical apparatus and in certain alloys such as german silver it is magnetic and is very frequently accompanied by cobalt both being found in meteoric iron it is chiefly valuable for the alloys it forms especially many superalloys and particularly stainless steel
nickel is one of the five ferromagnetic elements however the us nickel coin is not magnetic because it actually is mostly 75 copper the canadian nickel minted at various periods between 192281 was 999 nickel and these are magnetic nickel is also a naturally magnetostrictive material meaning that in the presence of a magnetic field the material undergoes a small change in length in the case of nickel this change in length is negative contraction of the material which is known as negative magnetostriction
the most common oxidation state of nickel is 2 though 0 1 3 and 4 ni complexes are observed it is also thought that a 6 oxidation state may exist however results are inconclusive
the unit cell of nickel is a face centred cube with a lattice parameter of 0356 nm giving a radius of the atom of 0126 nm
nickel62 is the most stable nuclide of all the existing elements it is more stable even than iron56
the use of nickel is ancient and can be traced back as far as 3500 bc bronzes from what is now syria had a nickel content of up to 2 further there are chinese manuscripts suggesting that white copper ie baitung was used in the orient between 1700 and 1400 bc however because the ores of nickel were easily mistaken for ores of silver any understanding of this metal and its use dates to more contemporary times
minerals containing nickel eg kupfernickel meaning copper of the devil nick or false copper were of value for colouring glass green in 1751 baron axel fredrik cronstedt was attempting to extract copper from kupfernickel now called niccolite and obtained instead a white metal that he called nickel
in the united states the term nickel or nick was originally applied to the coppernickel indian cent coin introduced in 1859 later the name designated the threecent coin introduced in 1865 and the following year the fivecent shield nickel appropriated the designation which has remained ever since coins of pure nickel were first used in 1881 in switzerland
nickel plays numerous roles in biology though they were not recognized until the 1970s in fact urease an enzyme which assists in the hydrolysis of urea contains nickel the nife hydrogenases contain nickel in addition to ironsulfur clusters such nife hydrogenases characteristically oxidise h2 a nickeltetrapyrrole coenzyme f430 is present in the methyl coenzyme m reductase which powers methanogenic archaea
one of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an fenis cluster

based on geophysical evidence most of the nickel on earth is postulated to be concentrated in the earths core
nickel is used in many industrial and consumer products including stainless steel magnets coinage and special alloys it is also used for plating and as a green tint in glass nickel is preeminently an alloy metal and its chief use is in the nickel steels and nickel cast irons of which there are innumerable varieties it is also widely used for many other alloys such as nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper chromium aluminum lead cobalt silver and gold
nickel consumption can be summarized as nickel steels 60 nickelcopper alloys and nickel silver 14 malleable nickel nickel clad inconel and other superalloys 9 plating 6 nickel cast irons 3 heat and electric resistance alloys such as nichrome 3 nickel brasses and bronzes 2 others 3
in the laboratory nickel is frequently used as a catalyst for hydrogenation most often using raney nickel a finely divided form of the metal
nickel can be recovered using extractive metallurgy most sulfide ores have traditionally been processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining recent advances in hydrometallurgy have resulted in recent nickel processing operations being developed using these processes most sulphide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction recent advances in hydrometallurgical processing of sulphides has led to some recent projects being built around this technology
nickel is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes which yield a metal of 75 purity final purification in the mond process to 9999 purity this process was patented by l mond and was used in south wales in the 20th century nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide at around 50 degrees celsius to form volatile nickel carbonyl any impurities remain solid the nickel carbonyl gas is passed into a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres are maintained in constant motion the nickel carbonyl decomposes depositing pure nickel onto the nickel spheres known as pellets alternatively the nickel carbonyl may be decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230 degrees celsius to create fine powders the resultant carbon monoxide is recirculated through the process the highly pure nickel produced by this process is known as carbonyl nickel a second common form of refining involves the leaching of the metal matte followed by the electrowinning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode in many stainless steel applications the nickel can be taken directly in the 75 purity form depending on the presence of any impurities

webelementscom ndash ni also used as a reference niobium or columbium is a chemical element that has the symbol nb and atomic number 41 a rare soft gray ductile transition metal niobium is found in pyrochlore and columbite it was first discovered in the latter mineral and so was initially named columbium now that mineral is also called niobite niobium is used in special steel alloys as well as in welding nuclear industries electronics optics and jewelry
niobium is a shiny gray ductile metal that takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods niobiums chemical properties are almost identical to the chemical properties of tantalum which appears below niobium in the periodic table
when it is processed at even moderate temperatures niobium must be placed in a protective atmosphere the metal begins to oxidize in air at 200 c its most common oxidation states are 3 and 5 although others are also known
niobium has a number of uses it is a component of some stainless steels and an alloy of other nonferrous metals it is also a very important alloy addition in hsla steels which are widely used as structural components in modern automobiles these alloys are strong and are often used in pipeline construction other uses the metal has a low capture crosssection for thermal neutrons and so finds use in the nuclear industries it is also the metal used in arc welding rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel appreciable amounts of niobium in the form of highpurity ferroniobium and nickel niobium are used in nickel cobalt and iron base superalloys for such applications as jet engine components rocket subassemblies and heatresisting and combustion equipment for example advanced air frame systems such as those used in the gemini program used this metal niobium is being evaluated as an alternative to tantalum in capacitors because niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and thus hypoallergenic they are used in jewelry and in medical devices such as pacemakers niobium treated with sodium hydroxide forms a porous layer that aids osseointegration along with titanium tantalum and aluminum niobium can also be electrically heated and anodized to a wide array of colors using a process known as reactive metal anodizing this makes it very attractive for use in jewelry niobium is also added to glass in order to attain a higher refractive index a property used in the optical industry to make thinner corrective glasses in 2005 the country of sierra leone made a coin honoring pope john paul ii that contained a disc of 24 carat 100 gold surrounded by a ring of purpletinted niobium
niobium becomes a superconductor when lowered to cryogenic temperatures at atmospheric pressure it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors 93 k niobium has the largest magnetic penetration depth of any element in addition it is one of the three elemental superconductors that are type ii the others being vanadium and technetium meaning it remains a superconductor when subjected to high magnetic fields niobium tin and niobium titanium alloys are used as wires for superconducting magnets capable of producing exceedingly strong magnetic fields niobium is also used in its pure form to make superconducting accelerating structures for particle accelerators
niobium greek mythology niobe daughter of tantalus was discovered by charles hatchett in 1801 hatchett found niobium in columbite ore that was sent to england in the 1750s by john winthrop the first governor of connecticut there was a considerable amount of confusion about the difference between the closelyrelated niobium and tantalum that wasnt resolved until 1846 by heinrich rose and jean charles galissard de marignac who rediscovered the element since rose was unaware of hatchetts work he gave the element a different name niobium in 1864 christian blomstrand was the first to prepare the pure metal reducing niobium chloride by heating it in a hydrogen atmosphere
columbium symbol cb was the name originally given to this element by hatchett but the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac officially adopted niobium as the name for element 41 in 1950 after 100 years of controversy this was a compromise of sorts the iupac accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to north american usage and niobium instead of columbium in deference to european usage not everyone agreed however and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations refer to it by the official iupac name many leading metallurgists metal societies and most leading american commercial producers still refer to the metal by the original columbium

naturally occurring niobium is composed of one stable isotope nb93 the most stable radioisotopes are nb92 with a halflife of 347 million years nb94 half life 20300 years and nb91 with a half life of 680 years there is also a meta state at 31 kev whose halflife is 1613 years twenty three other radioisotopes have been characterized most of these have half lives that are less than two hours except nb95 35 days nb96 234 hours and nb90 146 hours the primary decay mode before the stable nb93 is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission with some neutron emission occurring in the first mode of the two mode decay of nb104 109 and 110
only nb95 35 days and nb97 72 minutes and heavier isotopes halflives in seconds are fission products in significant quantity as the other isotopes are shadowed by stable or very longlived zr93 isotopes of the preceding element zirconium from production via beta decay of neutronrich fission fragments nb95 is the decay product of zr95 64 days so disappearance of nb95 in used nuclear fuel is slower than would be expected from its own 35 day halflife alone tiny amounts of the other isotopes may be produced as direct fission products

neodymium was discovered by baron carl auer von welsbach an austrian chemist in vienna in 1885 he separated neodymium as well as the element praseodymium from a material known as didymium by means of fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrates from nitric acid while following the separation by spectroscopic analysis however it was not isolated in relatively pure form until 1925 the name neodymium is derived from the greek words neos new and didymos twin neodymium is frequently misspelled as neodynium
double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s the lindsay chemical division of american potash and chemical corporation at one time the largest producer of rare earths in the world offered neodymium oxide purified in this manner in grades of 65 85 and 95 purity at prices ranging from approximately 2 to 20 dollars per pound in 1960 dollars lindsay was the first to commercialize largescale ionexchange purification of neodymium using the technology developed by frank spedding at iowa state universityames laboratory one pound of their 99 oxide was priced at 35 in 1960 their 999 grade only cost 5 dollars more starting in the 1950s high purity eg 99 neodymium was primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite sand celathndypo4 a material rich in rare earth elements the metal itself is obtained through electrolysis of its halide salts currently most neodymium is extracted from bastnaesite celandprco3f and purified by solvent extraction ionexchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities typically 4n when molycorp first introduced their 98 grade of neodymium oxide in 1965 made by solvent extraction from mountain pass california bastnaesite it was priced at 5 dollars per pound for small quantities lindsay soon discontinued operations the evolving technology and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass made therefrom that resides in collections today early moser pieces and other neodymium glass made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium when the fractional crystallization technology had to be relied on

in september 2002 researchers at the university of california los alamos national laboratory created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with enriched uranium discovering that the critical mass of neptunium is less than previously predicted us officials in march 2008 planned to move the nations supply of separated neptunium to a site in nevada
neptunium named for the planet neptune the next planet out from uranus after which uranium was named was first discovered by edwin mcmillan and philip h abelson in the year 1940 in berkeley california initially predicted by walter russell s spiral organization of the periodic table it was found at the berkeley radiation laboratory of the university of california berkeley where the team produced the neptunium isotope 239np 24 day halflife by bombarding uranium with slow moving neutrons it was the first transuranium element produced synthetically and the first actinide series transuranium element discovered
trace amounts of neptunium are found naturally as decay products from transmutation reactions in uranium ores 237np is produced through the reduction of 237npf3 with barium or lithium vapor at around 1200 c and is most often extracted from spent nuclear fuel rods as a byproduct in plutonium production

the name oxygen was coined in 1777 by antoine lavoisier from the greek roots οξύς oxys acid lit sharp from the taste of acids and γενής genēs producer lit begetter because he mistook oxygen to be a constituent of all acids
free diatomic oxygen or dioxygen o2 is together with nitrogen one of the two major components of air constituting about a fifth of the volume of air
oxygen is highly reactive and readily forms compounds with most other elements its compounds with silicon and metals are abundant in the earths crustal rocks and with hydrogen in water h2o the nucleic acids and all of the major classes of structural molecules in living organisms proteins polysaccharides and fats contain oxygen as do the major inorganic compounds that comprise animal shell calcium carbonate and tooth and bone calcium phosphate dioxygen is produced from water by cyanobacteria algae and plants during photosynthesis and the energy required to sustain life in aerobicallyrespiring organisms is provided by enzyme mediated oxidation of sugars and carboxylic acids which are themselves already oxygencontaining compounds without oxygen most organisms with aerobic respiration die within minutes however free oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms and was a poisonous waste product for early life on earth
at standard temperature and pressure oxygen is a colorless odorless gas with the molecular formula o2 in which the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other with a triplet electron configuration this bond has a bond order of two and is often simplified in description as a double bond
triplet oxygen is the ground state of the oxygen molecule the electron configuration of the molecule has two unpaired electrons occupying two degenerate molecular orbitals these orbitals are classified as antibonding weakening the bond order from three to two so the diatomic oxygen bond is weaker than the diatomic nitrogen triple bond in which all bonding molecular orbitals are filled but fewer antibonding ones are though unpaired electrons are commonly associated with high reactivity in chemical compounds triplet oxygen is relatively nonreactive by comparison with most radicals
in normal triplet form oxygen molecules are paramagnetic due to the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o2 molecules oxygens paramagnetism can be used analytically in paramagnetic oxygen gas analysers that determine the purity of gaseous oxygen
singlet oxygen a name given to several higherenergy species of molecular oxygen in which all the electron spins are paired is much more reactive towards common organic molecules in nature singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis using the energy of sunlight it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen
oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen water containing approximately 1 part of oxygen to 2 of nitrogen compared with a ratio in the atmosphere of approximately 14 the solubility of oxygen in water is temperaturedependent and about twice as much 146 mgl1dissolves at 0 c than at 20c 76 mgl1 at 25 c at 1 atm of air freshwater contains about 604 ml 863 mg 027 mmol of oxygen per liter whereas sea water contains about 49 ml 70 mg 022 mmol per liter at 0 c the solubilities increase to 103 ml 147 mg 046 mmol per liter for water and 80 ml 114 mg 036 mmol per liter for sea water
oxygen condenses at 9020 k 18295 c 29731 f and freezes at 5436 k 21879 c 36182 f both liquid and solid o2 are clear substances with a light skyblue color caused by absorption in the red by contrast with the blue color of the sky which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light highpurity liquid o2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquified air liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant it is a highlyreactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials
the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth o2 is known as dioxygen elemental oxygen is most commonly encountered in this form as about 21 by volume of earths atmosphere o2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kjmol
triatomic oxygen ozone o3 the less common triatomic allotrope of oxygen is a poisonous gas with a distinctive odor traces of it can be detected as a sharp chlorinelike smell coming from electric motors laser printers and photocopiers it was named ozone by christian friedrich schönbein in 1840 from the greek word öįώ ozo for smell liquid and solid o3 have a deeperblue color than ordinary oxygen and they are unstable and explosive
a newlydiscovered allotrope of oxygen tetraoxygen o4 is a deepred solid that is created by pressurizing o2 to the order of 20 gpa its properties are being studied for use in rocket fuels and similar applications as it is a much more powerful oxidizer than either o2 or o3 when tetraoxygen is subjected to a pressure of 96 gpa it becomes metallic in a similar manner as hydrogen and becomes more similar to the heavier chalcogens such as tellurium and polonium both of which show significant metallic character
in almost all known compounds of oxygen the oxidation state of oxygen is 2 the oxidation state 1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon 12 superoxides 13 ozonides 0 elemental hypofluorous acid 12 dioxygenyl 1 dioxygen difluoride and 2 oxygen difluoride
the most familiar oxygen compound is water the oxide of hydrogen h2o oxygen as a compound is also present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide co2 however the earths crustal rock is composed predominantly of oxides of silicon as silica sio2 found in granite and sand silicates found in feldspars and oxygen compounds of metals such as calcium as calcium carbonate in limestone aluminium as silicates in feldspars and as aluminium oxide in bauxite and corundum iron as iron iii oxide fe2o3 in hematite and rust etc
other important examples of oxygen compounds include the compounds of carbon and oxygen such as alcohols roh where r is an organic group carbonyls rcoh or rcor such as formaldehyde and acetone and carboxylic acids rcooh such as acetic acid and palmitic acid a common fatty acid found in animals and plants and the food products derived from them such as palm oil and milk products
oxygenated radicals such as chlorates clo3minus perchlorates clo4minus chromates cro42minus dichromates cr2o72minus permanganates mno4minus and nitrates no3minus are strong oxidizing agents phosphorus is important in its oxygenated form as the phosphate po43minus ion present in bone as calcium phosphate and as the backbone of rna and dna
oxygen forms heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate ions with tungsten molybdenum and some other transition metals phosphotungstic acid pta or dodecatungstophosphoric acid has the chemical formula h3pw12o40 while octadecamolybdophosphoric acid is h6p2mo18o62
oxygen forms compounds with almost all of the other known elements including some of the rarest technetium tcosub4subsupminussup promethium chempm2o3 and neptunium and also with some of the least reactive elements such as xenon chemxeo3 gold chemau2o3 and platinum synthetic elements that have known oxides include plutonium chempuo2 americium curium berkelium californium and einsteinium
one unexpected oxygen compound is dioxygen hexafluoroplatinate o2ptf6minus discovered when neil bartlett was studying the properties of platinum hexafluoride ptf6 he noticed a change in color when this compound was exposed to atmospheric air and reasoned that xenon should be oxidized by ptf6 this led him to the discovery of xenon hexafluoroplatinate xeptf6minus
the cation o22 in o2f2 is only formed in the presence of stronger oxidants than oxygen which limits it to oxygen fluorides eg oxygen fluoride
when dissolved in water many metallic oxides form alkaline solutions while many oxides of nonmetals form acidic solutions for example sodium oxide in solution forms the strong base sodium hydroxide while phosphorus pentoxide in solution forms phosphoric acid
the alkali metals in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium magnesium calcium strontium and barium all react spontaneously with oxygen when exposed to air to form oxides and form hydroxides in the presence of water none of these elements are found in nature as free metals cesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a getter in vacuum tubes the surface of aluminium is always oxidised in the presence of air coated with a thin film of aluminium oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion the aluminium oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of electrolytic anodising although solid magnesium and aluminium react slowly with oxygen at stp they are both capable of burning in air generating very high temperatures and the metal powders may form explosive mixtures with air
some substances need to be heated before they will react with oxygen in bulk but some such as iron readily forms iron oxide or rust fe2o3 the production of free oxygen by photosynthetic bacteria some 35 billion years ago precipitated iron out of solution in the oceans as fe2o3 in the economicallyimportant iron ore hematite
due to its electronegativity oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other free elements at elevated temperatures to give corresponding oxides socalled noble metals common examples gold platinum resist direct chemical combination with oxygen and substances like goldiii oxide must be formed by an indirect route
peroxides retain some of oxygens original molecular structureoo white or light yellow sodium peroxide na2o2 is formed when metallic sodium na is burned in oxygen each oxygen atom in its peroxide ion may have a full octet of 4 pairs of electrons superoxides are a class of compounds that are very similar to peroxides but with just one unpaired electron for each pair of oxygen atoms o2
hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can be produced by passing a volume of 96 to 98 hydrogen and 2 to 4 oxygen through an electric discharge
silica is the common name for the compound silicon dioxide sio2 quartz illustrated is the naturallyoccurring crystalline mineral form of silica and common deposits of quartz are in igneous rocks such as granite sandstones and sand
most chemicallycombined oxygen is locked in a class of minerals called silicates which in turn are the major component of rocks and clays the basic structure of silicates consists of two parts units of silicon surrounded by four oxygen anions in a tetrahedral arrangement and units of metaloxygen polyhedra that contain metal cations examples aluminium calcium iron and sodium
water soluble silicates in the form of na4sio4 na2sio3 and na2si2o5 are used as detergents and adhesives
among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are where r is an organic group alcohols roh ethers ror ketones rcor aldehydes rcoh carboxylic acids rcooh esters rcoor acid anhydrides rcoocor amides rconr2 there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen among which acetone methanol ethanol isopropanol furan thf diethyl ether dioxane ethylacetate dmf dmso acetic acid formic acid acetone ch32co and phenol c6h5oh are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are glycerol formaldehyde glutaraldehyde citric acid acetic anhydride acetamide etc epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms
oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation
ethylene oxide used to make the antifreeze ethylene glycol is obtained by direct oxidation of ethylene c2h4 o2 catalyst c2h4o peracetic acid feeder material for various epoxy compounds is obtained from acetaldehyde ch3cho o2 catalyst ch3coooh
of the organic compounds with biological relevance carbohydrates such as glucose contain a large amount of oxygen all fatty acids such as oleic acid and aminoacids contain oxygen due to the presence of carboxyl group furthermore seven of the amino acids incorporate oxygen in the sidechain too serine tyrosine threonine glutamic acid glutamine aspartic acid and asparagine oxygen also occurs in phosphate groups in the biologically important energycarrying molecules atp and adp and in the backbone of rna and dna
oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe after hydrogen and helium and is the most common component of the worlds oceans 8881 by mass earth is unusual in having such a high concentration of free oxygen in its atmosphere with 015 oxygen by volume the atmosphere of mars has the secondmostabundant concentration by volume of any planet in the solar system while venus comes in third place
the unusually high concentration of elemental oxygen on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth the atmosphere the biosphere and the lithosphere the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis which is responsible for modern earths atmosphere because of the vast amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere even if all photosynthesis were to cease it would take at least 5000 years to strip out more or less all oxygen
free elemental dioxygen also occurs in solution in the worlds water bodies the higher solubility of o2 at low temperatures see physical properties has important implications for ocean life as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content polluted water may have reduced amounts of oxygen in it depleted by decaying algae and other biomaterials see eutrophication scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the waters biochemical oxygen demand bod or the amount of oxygen needed to restore a normal oxygen concentration
naturally occurring oxygen is composed of 3 stable isotopes 16o 17o and 18o with 16o being the most abundant 99762 natural abundance oxygen isotopes range in mass number from 12 to 28
relative and absolute abundance of 16o is due to it being a principal product of stellar evolution and the fact that it is a primary isotope meaning it can be made by stars that were initially made exclusively of hydrogen most 16o is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in stars the triplealpha reaction creates 12 c which captures an additional 4 he to make 16o the neon burning process creates additional 16o
both 17o and 18o are secondary isotopes meaning that their nucleosynthesis requires seed nuclei 17o is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the cno cycle making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars
fourteen radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 15o with a halflife of 12224nbsps and 14o with a halflife of 70606nbsps
an atomic mass of 16 was assigned to oxygen prior to the definition of the unified atomic mass unit based upon 12c since physicists referred to 16o only while chemists meant the naturallyabundant mixture of isotopes this led to slightly different atomic mass scales
the isotopic composition of oxygen atoms in the earths atmosphere is 99759 16o 0037 17o and 0204 18o fresh water and polar ice on earth contains slightly less 01981 of the heavy isotope 18o than air 0204 or seawater containing 01995 since the 18o16o isotope ratio in marine calcium carbonate equilibrates with that in the atmosphere fluctuations in the oxygen isotope ratio in foraminifera can be used as a climate proxy increasing during accumulation of polar ice and decreasing during warmer periods
in nature free oxygen is produced by the lightdriven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria green algae and plants algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70 of the free oxygen produced on earth the remainder is produced by terrestrial plants although almost all oxygen produced in tropical forests is consumed by organisms in those forests
the overall formula for photosynthesis is
6co2 6h2o sunlight c6h12o6 6o2
or simply carbon dioxide water sunlight glucose oxygen
photolytic oxygen evolution part of photosynthesis occurs via the lightdependent oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and can be written as the following simplified chemical reaction
2h2o 4e 4h o2 the reaction requires the energy of four photons the electrons from the oxidized water molecules replace electrons in the p680 component of photosystem ii which have been removed into an electron transport chain via lightdependent excitation and resonance energy transfer onto plastoquinone photosytem ii therefore has also been referred to as waterplastoquinone oxidoreductase the protons are released into the thylakoid lumen thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane this proton gradient is the driving force for atp synthesis via photophosphorylation and coupling the absorption of light energy and photolysis of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis
water oxidation is catalyzed by a manganese containing enzyme complex associated with thylakoid membranes known as the oxygen evolving complex oec or watersplitting complex manganese is an important cofactor and calcium and chloride are also required for the reaction to occur
dna and proteins contain oxygen and the element is found in almost all molecules that are important to life molecular oxygen o2 is essential for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms vertebrate animals use hemoglobin in their blood to transport oxygen from their lungs to their tissues but other animals use hemocyanin molluscs and some arthropods or hemerythrin spiders and lobsters
in vertebrates oxygen uptake is carried out by the following processes
oxygen diffuses through membranes and into red blood cells after inhalation into the lungs the heme group of hemoglobin binds oxygen when it is present and co2 is released from another part of the hemoglobin molecule as is acid which causes co2 to be released from bicarbonate its major reservoir in blood plasma bohr effect after being carried in blood to a body tissue in need of oxygen o2 is handedoff from the heme group to monooxygenase an enzyme that also has an active site with an atom of iron
reactive oxygen species are dangerous byproducts that sometimes result from the use of oxygen in organisms important examples include oxygen free radicals such as the highlydangerous superoxide o2 and the less harmful hydrogen peroxide h 2o2
parts of the immune system of higher organisms however create peroxide superoxide and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes recently singlet oxygen has been found to be a source of biologicallyproduced ozone this reaction proceeds through an unusual compound dihydrogen trioxide also known as trioxidane hoooh which is an antibodycatalyzed product of singlet oxygen and water this compound in turn disproportionates to ozone and peroxide providing two powerful antibacterials the bodys range of defense against all of these active oxidizing agents is hardly surprising then given their deliberate employment as antimicrobial agents in the immune response
oxygen was almost nonexistent in earths atmosphere before the evolution of water oxidation in photosynthetic bacteria free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic era between 25 billion years ago and 16 billion years ago as a product of the photosynthetic action of early anaerobes archaea and bacteria these organisms fossil evidence for which occurs in the form of stromatolites and oncolites developed the mechanism of oxygen evolution in the archean era between 35 and 27 billion years ago at first the produced oxygen dissolved in the oceans where it was reduced by dissolved iron compounds precipitating iron oxide fe2o3 and creating banded iron formations that are now a valuable resource of iron ore hematite oxygen started to gas out of the oxygensaturated waters from about 27 billion years ago as is evident from the rusting of ironrich terrestrial rocks starting around that time the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere increased gradually at first and then more rapidly around 22 to 17 billion years ago to about 10 of its present level as available reducing agents in the oceans and crustal rocks became oxidized
the development of an oxygenrich atmosphere was one of the most important events in the history of life on earth the presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the anaerobic organisms then living to extinction during the oxygen catastrophe about 24 billion years ago however the high electronegativity of o2 creates a large potential energy drop for cellular respiration thus enabling organisms using aerobic respiration to produce much more atp than anaerobic organisms this makes them so efficient that they have come to dominate earths biosphere photosynthesis and cellular respiration of oxygen allowed for the evolution of eukaryotic cells and ultimately complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals
the atmospheric abundance of free oxygen in later geological epochs and its gradual increase up to the present has been largely due to synthesis by photosynthetic organisms over the past 500 million years oxygen levels fluctuated between 15 and 30 per volume towards the end of the carboniferous era coal age about 300 million years ago atmospheric oxygen levels reached a maximum of 35 by volume
two major methods are employed to produce the 100 million tonnes of oxygen extracted from air for industrial uses annually
the other major method of producing oxygen involves passing a stream of clean dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to 93 oxygen or vacuum swing adsorption vsa technolgies
oxygen can also be produced through electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen a similar method is the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from oxides and oxoacids chemical catalysts can be used as well such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the lifesupport equipment on submarines which are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies
another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium oxide by either high pressure or an electric current to produce nearly pure oxygen
in large quantities the price of liquid oxygen 2001 is approximately 021kg since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air the production cost will change as energy cost varies
oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in speciallyinsulated tankers because one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840nbspliters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 c
uptake of oxygen from the air is the essential purpose of respiration so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema pneumonia some heart disorders and any disease that impairs the bodys ability to take up and use oxygen treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals the patients home or increasingly by portable devices oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas hyperbaric medicine uses hyperbaric oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of oxygen around the patient and when needed the medical staff
carbon monoxide poisoning gas gangrene and decompression sickness the bends are sometimes treated using these devices increased oxygen concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin oxygen is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive resulting in bubbles of inert gas mostly nitrogen and argon forming in their blood increasing the pressure of oxygen as soon as possible is part of the treatment
a notable application of oxygen as a lowpressure breathing gas is in modern spacesuits which surround their occupants body with pressurized air these devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure resulting in a normal blood partial pressures of oxygen this tradeoff of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain flexible spacesuits
scuba divers and submariners also rely on artificiallydelivered oxygen but most often use normal pressure andor mixtures of oxygen and air pure or nearly pure oxygen use in diving at higherthansealevel pressures is usually limited to rebreather decompression or emergency treatment use at relatively shallow depths 6 meters depth or less deeper diving requires significant dilution of oxygen with other gases such as nitrogen or helium to help prevent oxygen toxicity
people who climb mountains or fly in nonpressurized fixedwing aircraft sometimes have supplemental oxygen supplies passengers traveling in commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of oxygen automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat causing oxygen masks to drop and forcing iron fillings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister
oxygen as a supposed mild euphoric has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports oxygen bars are establishments found in japan california and las vegas nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal oxygen exposure for a fee professional athletes especially in american football also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a supposed boost in performance however the reality of a pharmacological effect is doubtful a placebo or psychological boost being the most plausible explanation
smelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55 of commerciallyproduced oxygen
another 25 of commerciallyproduced oxygen is used by the chemical industry
most of the remaining 20 of commerciallyproduced oxygen is used in medical applications metal cutting and welding as an oxidizer in rocket fuel and in water treatment rocket propulsion requires a fuel and an oxidizer larger rockets use liquid oxygen as their oxidizer which is mixed and ignited with the fuel for propulsion
paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen18 and oxygen16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago during periods of lower global temperatures sea water molecules that contain the lighter isotope oxygen16 evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 heavier oxygen18 snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be enriched in oxygen16 and the seawater left behind tends to be enriched in oxygen18 marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate
oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nanometers some scientists have proposed to use the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those oxygen bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform this is because in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetations reflectance from the vegetations fluorescence which is much weaker the measurement presents several technical difficulties due to the low signal to noise ratio and due to the vegetations architecture but it has been proposed as a possibility to monitor the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale
one of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century bce greek writer on mechanics philo of byzantium in his work pneumatica philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessels neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philos work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration
in the late 17th century robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion english chemist john mayow refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus in one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace onefourteenth of the airs volume before extinguishing the subjects from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion
mayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it
robert hooke ole borch mikhail lomonosov and pierre bayen all also produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th century but none of them recognized it as an element this was largely due to the prevalence of a philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory which was then the favored explanation of how those processes worked
established in 1667 by german alchemist j j becher and modified by chemist georg ernst stahl by 1731 phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts one part called phlogiston was given off when the substance containing it was burned while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form its calx
highlycombustible materials that leave little residuum such as wood or coal were thought of as made mostly of phlogiston whereas noncombustible substances that corrode such as iron contained very little air did not play a role in phlogiston theory and no initial quantitative experiments were conducted to test the idea instead it was based on observations of what happened when something burns that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process
an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley on august 1 1774 focused sunlight on mercuric oxide hgo inside a glass tube which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it after breathing the gas himself he wrote the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards
unknown to priestley swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele had already produced oxygen by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates by about 1772 scheele called the gas fire air because it was the only known supporter of combustion
noted french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently however priestley visited lavoisier in october 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas scheele also posted a letter to lavoisier on september 30 1774 that described his own discovery of the previouslyunknown substance but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it a copy of the letter was found in scheeles belongings after his death
what lavoisier did indisputably do was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works
in one experiment lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container
lavoisier later renamed vital air to oxygène after the greek roots meaning acid former while azote was renamed nitrogen
scientists realized by the late 19th century that compressing and cooling air could be used to liquefy and isolate its components using a cascade method swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen enough to liquefy it he sent a telegram on december 22 1877 to the french academy of sciences in paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen just two days later french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method of liquefying oxygen
in 1891 scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study later in 1901 oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed oxygen this method of welding and cutting metal later became common
in 1923 american scientist robert h goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer goddard successfully flew a small liquidfueled rocket 56nbspm at around 97nbspkph on march 16 1926 in auburn massachusetts
oxygen can be toxic at elevated partial pressures leading to convulsions and other health problems since oxygen partial pressure is the fraction of oxygen times the total pressure elevated partial pressures can occur either from high oxygen fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure or a combination of both oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 05 atmospheres or 25 times the normal sealevel oxygen partial pressure of about 02 atmospheres or bars this means that at sealevel pressures mixtures containing less than 50 oxygen are essentially nontoxic however in medical applications such as in ventilation gas mixtures in hospital applications mixtures containing more than 50 oxygen can be expected to show lung toxicity causing slow damage to the lungs over periods of days with the rate of damage rising rapidly from mixtures between 50 and 100 oxygen therefore air supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of 30 oxygen by volume
breathing 100 oxygen in space applications such as in some modern spacesuits or in early spacecraft such as the apollo spacecraft causes no damage due to the low total pressures 30 to 33 sealevel used in the case of spacesuits the oxygen partial pressure in the breathing gas is in general about 030 bar 14 times normal and the resulting oxygen partial pressure in the astronauts arterial blood due to downward adjustments due to water vapor and co2 in the alveoli is only marginally more than the normal sealevel oxygen partial pressure of 013 bar see arterial blood gas
in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving and when using equipment that can provide high partial pressures of oxygen such as rebreathers oxygen toxicity to the lungs can occur just as in medical applications due to the higher total pressures in these applications the fraction of oxygen that produces lung damage may be considerably less than 50 more important under pressures higher than normal sealevel a far more serious form of oxygen toxicity in the central nervous system may lead to generalized seizures or convulsions
certain forms of oxygen such as ozone o3 singlet oxygen and some derivatives of oxygen such as hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals and superoxide are also highly toxic
highlyconcentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity however an ignition event such as heat or a spark is needed to trigger combustion oxygen itself is not the fuel but an oxidant
concentrated oxygen will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically
liquid oxygen spills if allowed to soaked into organic matter such as wood petrochemicals and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact
combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential such as peroxides chlorates nitrates perchlorates and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire

osmium in a metallic form is extremely dense bluewhite brittle and lustrous even at high temperatures but proves to be extremely difficult to make powdered osmium is easier to make but powdered osmium exposed to air leads to the formation of osmium tetroxide os o 4 which is very toxic the tetroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell that boils at 130 c by contrast osmium dioxide os o 2 is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic
due to its very high density osmium is generally considered to be the densest known element narrowly defeating iridium however calculations of density from the space lattice may produce more reliable data for these elements than actual measurements and give a density of 22650 kgmsup3sup for iridium versus 22610 kgm for osmium definitive selection between the two is therefore not possible at this time if one distinguishes different isotopes then the highest density ordinary substance would be 192os the extraordinary density of osmium is a consequence of the lanthanide contraction
osmium has a very low compressibility correspondingly its bulk modulus is extremely highcommonly quoted as 462 gpa which is higher than that of diamond but lower than that of aggregated diamond nanorods although there is some debate in the academic community about whether it is in fact this high a paper by cynn et al reported that osmium had this bulk modulus based on an experimental result but other authors have cast doubt upon this and references therein
osmium metal has the highest melting point and the lowest vapor pressure of the platinum family common oxidation states of osmium are 4 and 3 but oxidation states from 1 to 8 are observed
because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state and is instead often alloyed with other metals that are used in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinum group metals is almost entirely used in alloys employed in the tips of fountain pens phonograph needles instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent use
osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for microscope slides as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carboncarbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them since osmium atoms are extremely electron dense making oso4 an important stain for transmission electron microscopy tem studies of many biological materials an alloy of 90 platinum and 10 osmium 9010 is used in surgical implants such as pacemakers and replacement pulmonary valves
the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous
in 1898 an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in 1902 after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten originally known as wolfram tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps
the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in 1906 when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram
osmium greek osme meaning a smell was discovered in 1803 by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england
wollaston and tennant were looking for a way to purify platinum by dissolution of native platinum ore in aqua regia large amounts of insoluble black powder remained as a byproduct of this operation
wollaston concentrated on the soluble portion and discovered palladium in 1802 and rhodium in 1804 while tennant examined the insoluble residue in the summer of 1803 tennant identified two new elements osmium and iridium discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june 21 1804
turkey with 127000 tons has the worlds largest known reserve of osmium bulgaria also has substantial reserves of about 2500 tons this transition metal is also found in iridiosmium a naturally occurring alloy of iridium and osmium and in platinum bearing river sands in the ural mountains and north and south america it also occurs in nickel bearing ores found in the sudbury ontario region with other platinum group metals even though the quantity of platinum metals found in these ores is small the large volume of nickel ores processed makes commercial recovery possible

osmium has seven naturallyoccurring isotopes 5 of which are stable 187os 188os 189os 190os and most abundant 192os the other two 184os and 186os have enormously long halflives and for practical purposes can be considered to be stable as well 187os is the daughter of 187 re halflife 456 x 1010 years and is most often measured in an 187os188os ratio this ratio as well as the 187re187os ratio have been used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons however the most notable application of os in dating has been in conjunction with iridium to analyze the layer of shocked quartz along the kt boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago
osmium tetroxide is highly volatile penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation in contact with skin and if swallowed airborne low concentrations of osmium vapour can cause lung congestion skin or eye damage and it should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil
los alamos national laboratory osmium national synchrotron light source science highlights webelementscom osmium potassium is a chemical element it has the symbol k and atomic number 19 the name potassium comes from the word potash as potassium was first isolated from potash potassium is a soft silverywhite metallic alkali metal that occurs naturally bound to other elements in seawater and many minerals it oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive especially towards water in many respects potassium and sodium are chemically similar although organisms in general and animal cells in particular treat them very differently
potassium makes up about 15 of the weight of the earth s crust and is the seventh most abundant element as it is very electropositive potassium metal is difficult to obtain from its minerals it is never found free in nature as it reacts violently with water potassium salts such as carnallite langbeinite polyhalite and sylvite are found in ancient lake and sea beds these minerals form extensive deposits in these environments making extracting potassium and its salts more economical the principal source of potassium potash is mined in saskatchewan california germany new mexico utah and in other places around the world kazakhstan is the worlds leading exporter of potassium three thousand feet below the surface of saskatchewan are large deposits of potash which are important sources of this element and its salts with several large mines in operation since the 1960s saskatchewan pioneered the use of freezing of wet sands the blairmore formation in order to drive mine shafts through them the main mining company is the potash corporation of saskatchewan the oceans are another source of potassium but the quantity present in a given volume of seawater is relatively low compared with sodium
potassium can be isolated through electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since davy thermal methods also are employed in potassium production using potassium chloride
see also potassium minerals there are 24 known isotopes of potassium three isotopes occur naturally 39k 933 40k 00117 and 41k 67 naturally occurring 40k decays to stable sup40supar 112 by electron capture and by positron emission and decays to stable sup40supca 888 by beta decay 40k has a halflife of 1250times109 years the decay of 40k to 40ar enables a commonly used method for dating rocks the conventional kar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon ie 40ar was quantitatively retained minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40ar that has accumulated the minerals that are best suited for dating include biotite muscovite plutonichigh grade metamorphic hornblende and volcanic feldspar whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow instrusives can also be dated if they are unaltered
outside of dating potassium isotopes have been used extensively as tracers in studies of weathering they have also been used for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life
40k occurs in natural potassium and thus in some commercial salt substitutes in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations in healthy animals and people 40k represents the largest source of radioactivity greater even than 14c in a human body of 70 kg mass about 4400 nuclei of 40k decay per second
the activity of natural potassium is 31 bq g
potassium is the second least dense metal only lithium is less dense it is a soft lowmelting solid that can easily be cut with a knife freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance but in air it begins to tarnish toward grey immediately
potassium and its compounds emit a violet color in a flame this fact is the basis of the flame test for the presence of potassium in a sample potassium concentration in solution is commonly determined by flame photometry atomic absorption spectrophotometry inductively coupled plasma or ion selective electrodes
potassium must be protected from air for storage to prevent disintegration of the metal from oxide and hydroxide corrosion often samples are maintained under a reducing medium such as kerosene
like the other alkali metals potassium reacts violently with water producing hydrogen the reaction is notably more violent than that of lithium or sodium with water and is sufficiently exothermic that the evolved hydrogen gas ignites
2ks 2h2ol h2g 2kohaq because potassium reacts quickly with even traces of water and its reaction products are nonvolatile it is sometimes used alone or as nak an alloy with sodium which is liquid at room temperature to dry solvents prior to distillation in this role it serves as a potent desiccant
potassium hydroxide reacts strongly with carbon dioxide to produce potassium carbonate and is used to remove traces of co2 from air
potassium compounds generally have excellent water solubility due to the high hydration energy of the k ion the potassium ion is colorless in water
methods of separating potassium by precipitation sometimes used for gravimetric analysis include the use of sodium tetraphenyl boron dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate iv hexahydrate and sodium cobaltinitrite
potassium is important in nerve function and in influencing osmotic balance between cells and the interstitiual fluid
potassium may be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of tastebuds according to concentration dilute solutions of potassium ion taste sweet allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices while higher concentrations become increasingly bitteralkaline and finally also salty to the taste the combined bitterness and saltiness of high potassium content solutions makes highdose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge
potassium is also important in allowing muscle contraction and the sending of all nerve impulses in animals through action potentials because of the interaction of the charge on a potassium ion and its surrounding water molecules k ions are larger than na ions and ion channels and pumps in cell membranes can easily distinguish between the two types of ions actively pumping or passively allowing one of the two ions to pass while blocking the other
a shortage of potassium in body fluids may cause a potentially fatal condition known as hypokalemia typically resulting from diarrhea increased diuresis and vomiting deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness paralytic ileus ecg abnormalities decreased reflex response and in severe cases respiratory paralysis alkalosis and cardiac arrhythmia
potassium is an essential mineral macronutrient in human nutrition it is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells and it is thus important in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body sodium makes up most of the cations of blood plasma at about 145 milliequivalents per liter 3345 milligrams and potassium makes up most of the cell fluid cations at about 150 millequivalents per liter 4800 milligrams plasma is filtered through the glomerulus of the kidneys in enormous amounts about 180 liters per day thus 602000 milligrams of sodium and 33000 milligrams of potassium are filtered each day all but the 100010000 milligrams of sodium and the 10004000 milligrams of potassium likely to be in the diet must be reabsorbed sodium must be reabsorbed in such a way as to keep the blood volume exactly right and the osmotic pressure correct potassium must be reabsorbed in such a way as to keep serum concentration as close as possible to to 48 milliequivalents about 190 milligrams per liter sodium pumps must always operate to conserve sodium potassium must sometimes be conserved also but since the amount of potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large the situation is not so critical for potassium since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium in response to an apparent but not actual donnan equilibrium the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water at the end of the processing potassium is secreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules at that point it usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma if potassium were removed from the diet there would remain a minimum obligatory kidney excretion of about 200 mg per day when the serum declines to 3035 milliequivalents per liter in about one week and can never be cut off completely because it cannot be cut off completely death will result when the whole body potassium declines to the vicinity of onehalf full capacity at the end of the processing potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high
the potassium moves passively through pores in the cell wall when ions move through pumps there is a gate in the pumps on either side of the cell wall and only one gate can be open at once as a result 100 ions are forced through per second pores have only one gate and there one kind of ion only can stream through at 10 million to 100 million ions per second the pores require calcium in order to open although it is thought that the calcium works in reverse by blocking at least one of the pores carbonyl groups inside the pore on the amino acids mimics the water hydration that takes place in water solution by the nature of the electrostatic charges on four carbonyl groups inside the pore
adequate intake can generally be guaranteed by eating a variety of foods containing potassium and deficiency is rare in healthy individuals eating a balanced diet foods with high sources of potassium include in order from highest to lowest avocados potatoes bananas broccoli orange juice soybeans and apricots although it is also common in most fruits vegetables and meats diets high in potassium can reduce the risk of hypertension and a potassium deficiency combined with an adequate thiamine intake has produced heart disease in rats the 2004 guidelines of the institute of medicine specify an dri of 4000mg of potassium though most americans consume only half that amount per day similarly in the european union particularly in germany and italy insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common
supplements of potassium in medicine are most widely used in conjunction with loop diuretics and thiazides classes of diuretics which rid the body of sodium and water but have the side effect of also causing potassium loss in urine a variety of medical supplements are available if potassium supplements are used such as sodium free baking powder and sodium free table salt inadequate thiamine can cause beriberi a vitamin b1 deficiency is possible if food containing sulfite or sulfur dioxide is eaten or an alcoholic drink fermented with sulfur dioxide is consumed during the meal since sulfite destroys vitamin b1 in the intestines
individuals suffering from kidney diseases may suffer adverse health effects from consuming large quantities of dietary potassium end stage renal failure patients undergoing therapy by renal dialysis must observe strict dietary limits on potassium intake since the kidneys control potassium excretion and buildup of blood concentrations of potassium may trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmia acute hyperkalemia can be reduced through eating baking soda or glucose hyperventilation and perspiration

potassium was discovered in london england by sir humphry davy in 1807 he derived it from caustic potash k oh potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis
potassium was not known in roman times and its names are not classical latin but rather neolatin the name kalium was taken from the word alkali which came from arabic al qalīy the calcined ashes the name potassium was made from the word potash which is english and originally meant an alkali extracted in a pot from the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves
solid potassium reacts violently with water and should therefore be kept under a mineral oil such as kerosene and handled with care unlike lithium and sodium however potassium cannot be stored under oil indefinitely if stored longer than 6 months to a year dangerous shocksensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container which can detonate upon opening it is recommended that potassium rubidium or caesium not be stored for longer than three months unless stored in an inert oxygen free atmosphere or under vacuum
the extremely alkaline potassium hydroxide koh residue on the surface of potassium which has been exposed to moisture is a caustic hazard as with sodium metal the soapy feel of potassium metal on skin is due to caustic breakdown of the fats in skin into crude soft potassium soap and represents the beginning of an alkali burn potassium should obviously be handled with care with full skin and eye protection
potassium fires are exacerbated by water and only a few dry chemicals are effective for them potassium has also been discovered to react violently with iodine
potassium compounds potassium in biology webelementscom ndash potassium phosphorus meaning light and phoros meaning bearer is the chemical element that has the symbol p and atomic number 15 a multivalent nonmetal of the nitrogen group phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks
due to its high reactivity phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature one form of phosphorus white phosphorus emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen hence its greek derivation and the latin lightbearer meaning the planet venus as hesperus or morning star
phosphorus is a component of dna and rna and an essential element for all living cells the most important commercial use of phosphorusbased chemicals is the production of fertilisers
phosphorus compounds are also widely used in explosives nerve agents friction matches fireworks pesticides toothpaste and detergents
elemental phosphorus can exist in several allotropes most commonly white red and black
white phosphorus p4 exists as individual molecules made up of four atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement resulting in very high ring strain and instability it contains 6 single bonds
white phosphorus is a yellow waxy transparent solid for this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus it glows greenish in the dark when exposed to oxygen is highly flammable and pyrophoric selfigniting upon contact with air as well as toxic causing severe liver damage on ingestion the odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell and samples are commonly coated with white di phosphorus pentoxide which consists of p4o10 tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices white phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide the white allotrope can be produced using several different methods in one process calcium phosphate which is derived from phosphate rock is heated in an electric or fuelfired furnace in the presence of carbon and silica
red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to 250c 482f or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight phosphorus after this treatment exists as an amorphous network of atoms which reduces strain and gives greater stability further heating results in the red phosphorus becoming crystalline red phosphorus does not catch fire in air at temperatures below 240c whereas white phosphorus ignites at about 30c
in 1865 hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallized from molten lead a redpurple form is obtained this purple form is sometimes known as hittorfs phosphorus in addition a fibrous form exists with similar phosphorus cages below is shown a chain of phosphorus atoms which exhibits both the purple and fibrous forms
one of the forms of redblack phosphorus is a cubic solid
black phosphorus has an orthorhombic structure cmca and is the least reactive allotrope it consists of many sixmembered rings which are interlinked each atom is bonded to three other atoms a recent synthesis of black phosphorus using metal salts as catalysts has been reported
the diphosphorus allotrope p2 can be obtained normally only under extreme conditions for example from p4 at 1100 kelvin nevertheless some advancements were obtained in generating the diatomic molecule in homogenous solution under normal condtitions with the use by some transitional metal complexes based on for example tungsten and niobium
the glow from phosphorus was the attraction of its discovery around 1669 but the mechanism for that glow was not fully described until 1974 it was known from early times that the glow would persist for a time in a stoppered jar but then cease robert boyle in the 1680s ascribed it to debilitation of the air in fact it is oxygen being consumed by the 18th century it was known that in pure oxygen phosphorus does not glow at all there is only a range of partial pressure where it does heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures
in 1974 the glow was explained by r j van zee and a u khan
although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus the reaction which gives phosphorus its glow is properly called luminescence glowing by its own reaction in this case chemoluminescence not phosphorescence reemitting light that previously fell on it
concentrated phosphoric acids which can consist of 70 to 75 p2o5 are very important to agriculture and farm production in the form of fertilisers global demand for fertilizers led to large increases in phosphate po43 production in the second half of the 20th century other uses phosphates are utilized in the making of special glasses that are used for sodium lamps boneash calcium phosphate is used in the production of fine china sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in several countries and banned for this use in others phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as soda beverages the acid is also a starting point to make food grade phosphates these include monocalcium phosphate which is employed in baking powder and sodium tripolyphosphate and other sodium phosphates
phosphorus is a key element in all known forms of life inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate po43 plays a major role in biological molecules such as dna and rna where it forms part of the structural framework of these molecules living cells also use phosphate to transport cellular energy via adenosine triphosphate atp nearly every cellular process that uses energy obtains it in the form of atp atp is also important for phosphorylation a key regulatory event in cells phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones
an average adult human contains a little less than 1 kg of phosphorus about 85 of which is present in bones and teeth in the form of apatite and the remainder inside cells in soft tissues a wellfed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 13 g of phosphorus per day in the form of phosphate only about 01 of body phosphate circulates in the blood but this amount reflects the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells
in medicine low phosphate syndromes are caused by malnutrition by failure to absorb phosphate and by metabolic syndromes which draw phosphate from the blood or pass too much of it into the urine all are characterized by hypophosphatemia see article for medical details symptoms of low phosphate include muscle and neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of atp
phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants which is studied extensively in soil conservation in order to understand plant uptake from soil systems in ecological terms phosphorus is often a limiting nutrient in many environments ie the availability of phosphorus governs the rate of growth of many organisms in ecosystems an excess of phosphorus can be problematic especially in aquatic systems see eutrophication and algal blooms
phosphorus greek phosphoros was the ancient name for the planet venus but in greek mythology hesperus and eosphorus could be confused with phosphorus was discovered by german alchemist hennig brand in 1669 through a preparation from urine which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism working in hamburg brand attempted to distill some salts by evaporating urine and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly since that time phosphorescence has been used to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning
phosphorus was first made commercially for the match industry in the 19th century by distilling off phosphorus vapor from precipitated phosphates heated in a retort
early matches used white phosphorus in their composition which was dangerous due to its toxicity murders suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use an apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food which was detected by the stew giving off luminous steam
the electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war
today phosphorus production is larger than ever it is used as a precursor for various chemicals in particular the herbicide glyphosate sold under the brand name roundup production of white phosphorus takes place at large facilities and it is transported heated in liquid form some major accidents have occurred during transportation train derailments at brownston nebraska and miamisburg ohio led to large fires the worst accident in recent times was an environmental one in 1968 when phosphorus spilled into the sea from a plant at placentia bay newfoundland
see also phosphate minerals due to its reactivity with air and many other oxygencontaining substances phosphorus is not found free in nature but it is widely distributed in many different minerals
phosphate rock which is partially made of apatite an impure tricalcium phosphate mineral is an important commercial source of this element large deposits of apatite are located in china russia morocco florida idaho tennessee utah and elsewhere albright and wilson in the united kingdom and their niagara falls plant for instance were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from connetable tennessee and florida by 1950 they were using phosphate rock mainly from tennessee and north africa
at todays rate of consumption the supply of phosphorous is estimated to run out in 345 years
organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials some of which are extremely toxic fluorophosphate esters are among the most potent neurotoxins known a wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity to certain organisms as pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides etc and weaponized as nerve agents most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients for environmentally adverse effects of phosphates see eutrophication and algal blooms
the white phosphorus allotrope should be kept under water at all times as it presents a significant fire hazard due to its extreme reactivity with atmospheric oxygen and it should only be manipulated with forceps since contact with skin can cause severe burns chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called phossy jaw ingestion of white phosphorus may cause a medical condition known as smoking stool syndrome
when the white form is exposed to sunlight or when it is heated in its own vapour to 250c it is transmuted to the red form which does not phosphoresce in air the red allotrope does not spontaneously ignite in air and is not as dangerous as the white form nevertheless it should be handled with care because it reverts to white phosphorus in some temperature ranges and it also emits highly toxic fumes that consist of phosphorus oxides when it is heated
upon exposure to elemental phosphorus in the past it was suggested to wash the affected area with 2 copper sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that can be washed away according to the recent us navys treatment of chemical agent casualties and conventional military chemical injuries fm8285 part 2 conventional military chemical injuries cupric copperii sulfate has been used by us personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations however copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis
the manual suggests instead a bicarbonate solution to neutralize phosphoric acid which will then allow removal of visible wp particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them or by their phosphorescence in the dark in dark surroundings fragments are seen as luminescent spots then promptly debride the burn if the patients condition will permit removal of bits of wp which might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning do not apply oilybased ointments until it is certain that all wp has been removed following complete removal of the particles treat the lesions as thermal burns as white phosphorus readily mixes with oils any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed
further warnings of toxic effects and recommendations for treatment can be found in the emergency war surgery nato handbook part i types of wounds and injuries chapter iii burn injury chemical burns and white phosphorus injury
phosphorus can reduce elemental iodine to hydroiodic acid which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine for this reason two allotropes of elemental phosphorusred phosphorus and white phosphoruswere designated by the united states drug enforcement administration as list i precursor chemicals under 21 cfr 131002 effective november 17 2001 as a result in the united states handlers of red phosphorus or white phosphorus are subject to stringent regulatory controls pursuant to the controlled substances act in order to reduce diversion of these substances for use in clandestine production of controlled substances

palladium is a soft silverwhite metal that resembles platinum it is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals it is soft and ductile when annealed and greatly increases its strength and hardness when it is coldworked palladium is chemically attacked by sulfuric nitric and hydrochloric acid in which it dissolves slowly this metal also does not react with oxygen at normal temperatures and thus does not tarnish in air palladium heated to 800c will produce a layer of palladiumii oxide pdo it lightly tarnishes in moist atmosphere containing sulfur
this metal has the uncommon ability to absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen at room temperatures it is thought that this possibly forms palladium hydride pdh2 but it is not yet clear if this is a true chemical compound
when palladium has absorbed large amounts of hydrogen it will expand slightly in size
common oxidation states of palladium are 01 2 and 4 although originally 3 was thought of as one of the fundamental oxidation states of palladium there is no evidence for palladium occurring in the 3 oxidation state this has been investigated via xray diffraction for a number of compounds indicating a dimer of palladiumii and palladiumiv instead recently compounds with an oxidation state of 6 were synthesised

palladium hydride is metallic palladium that contains a substantial quantity of hydrogen within its crystal lattice at room temperature and atmospheric pressure palladium can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen in a reversible process this property has been investigated because hydrogen storage is of such interest and a better understanding of what happens at the molecular level could give clues to designing improved metal hydrides a palladium based store would be however prohibitively expensive due to the cost of the metal
palladium itself has occasionally been used as a precious metal in jewelry as replacement for platinum or white gold this is due to its naturally white properties giving it no need for a rhodium plating it is slightly whiter much lighter and about 12 harder similar to gold palladium can be beaten into a thin leaf form as thin as 100 nm 1250000 in
it can also be used as a substitute for nickel when making white gold palladium is one of three mostused metals that can be alloyed with gold to produce white gold nickel and silver can also be used palladiumgold is a much more expensive alloy than nickelgold but is hypoallergenic and holds its white color better
when platinum was declared a strategic government resource during world war ii many jewelry bands were made out of palladium as recently as september 2001 palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry also due to the technical obstacle of casting however the casting problem has been resolved and its use in jewelry has increased because of a large spike in the price of platinum and a drop in the price of palladium
prior to 2004 the principal use of palladium in jewelry was as an alloy in the manufacture of white gold jewelry but beginning early in 2004 when gold and platinum prices began to rise steeply chinese jewelers began fabricating significant volumes of palladium jewelry johnson matthey estimated that in 2004 with the introduction of palladium jewelry in china demand for palladium for jewelry fabrication was 920000 ounces or approximately 14 of the total palladium demand for 2004 an increase of almost 700000 ounces from 2003 this growth continued during 2005 with estimated worldwide jewelry demand for palladium of about 14 million ounces or almost 21 of net palladium supply again with most of the demand centered in china

promethiums longest lived isotope 145pm is a soft beta emitter with a halflife of 177 years it does not emit gamma rays but beta particles impinging on elements of high atomic numbers can generate xrays and a sample of 145pm does produce some such soft xray radiation in addition to beta particles
pure promethium exists in two allotropic forms and its chemistry is similar to other lanthanides promethium salts luminesce in the dark with a pale blue or greenish glow due to their high radioactivity promethium can be found in traces in some uranium ores as a fission product newly made promethium is also seen in the spectra of some stars
uses for promethium include as a beta radiation source for thickness gauges as a light source for signals that require reliable independent operation using phosphor to absorb the beta radiation and produce light in a nuclear battery in which photocells convert the light into electric current yielding a useful life of about five years using pm147 promethiumiii chloride pmcl3 mixed with zinc sulfide zn s was used for time as a major luminous paint for watches after radium was discontinued this mixture is still occasionally used for some luminous paint applications though most such uses with radioactive materials have switched to tritium for safety reasons promethium has a possible future uses in portable xray sources and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites although the alpha emitter plutonium238 has become standard for most spaceexploration related uses see radioisotope thermoelectric generators
the existence of promethium was first predicted by bohuslav brauner in 1902 this prediction was supported by henry moseley in 1914 who found a gap for a missing element which would have atomic number 61 but was unknown however moseley of course had no sample of the element to verify this several groups claimed to have produced the element but they could not confirm their discoveries because of the difficulty of separating promethium from other elements promethium was first produced and proved to exist at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in 1945 by jacob a marinsky lawrence e glendenin and charles d coryell by separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in the graphite reactor however being too busy with defenserelated research during world war ii they did not announce their discovery until 1947 the name promethium is derived from prometheus the titan in greek mythology who stole the fire from mount olympus and brought it down to mankind the name was suggested by grace mary coryell charles coryells wife who felt that they were stealing fire from the gods
in 1963 ionexchange methods were used at ornl to prepare about 10nbspgrams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes
today promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission it can also be produced by bombarding 146nd with neutrons turning it into 147nd which decays into 147pm through beta decay with a halflife of 11 days
promethium can be formed as a product of uranium fission only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores a sample of pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion 1018 by mass
promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star hr 465 in andromeda and possibly hd 101065 przybylskis star and hd 965
promethium compounds include chlorides pmclsub3sub bromides pmbrsub3sub oxides pmsub2subosub3sub
thirtysix radioisotopes of promethium have been characterized with the most stable being 145pm with a halflife of 177 years 146pm with a halflife of 553 years and 147pm with a halflife of 26234 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 364 days and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 27 seconds this element also has 11 meta states with the most stable being 148pmm t 4129 days 152pmm2 t 138 minutes and 152pmm t 752 minutes
the isotopes of promethium range in atomic weight from 1279482600 u 128pm to 1629535200 u 163pm the primary decay mode before the longestlived isotope 145pm is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta minus decay the primary decay products before 145pm are neodymium nd isotopes and the primary products after are samarium sm isotopes
besides technetium promethium is one of the two elements with atomic number less than 83 that have only unstable isotopes which is a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes
promethium must be handled with great care because of its high radioactivity in particular promethium can emit xrays during its beta decay its halflife is less than that of plutonium 239 by a factor of about 1350 and its biological toxicity is correspondingly higher promethium has no biological role

protactinium is a silver metallic element that belongs to the actinide group with a bright metallic luster that it retains for some time in the air it is superconductive at temperatures below 14 k
due to its scarcity high radioactivity and toxicity there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic scientific research
protactinium231 which is formed by the alpha decay of uranium235 followed by beta decay of thorium231 could possibly sustain a nuclear chain reaction and might in principle be used to build a nuclear weapon the critical mass according to walter seifritz is 750180 kg other authors conclude that no chain reactions are possible in protactinium231
an element between thorium and uranium was predicted to exist by mendeleev in 1871 in 1900 william crookes isolated protactinium as a radioactive material from uranium which he could not identify
protactinium was first identified in 1913 when kasimir fajans and o h göhring encountered shortlived isotope 234mpa with a halflife of about 117 minutes during their studies of the decay chain of 238u they gave the new element the name brevium latin brevis brief short the name was changed to protoactinium in 1918 when two groups of scientists otto hahn and lise meitner of germany and frederick soddy and john cranston of the uk independently discovered 231pa the name was shortened to protactinium in 1949
aristid v grosse prepared 2 mg of pa2o5 in 1927 and later on managed to isolate protactinium for the first time in 1934 from 01 mg of pa2o5 first converting the oxide to an iodide and then cracking it in a high vacuum by an electrically heated filament by the reaction 2pai5 2pa 5i2 iodide process
in 1961 the united kingdom atomic energy authority was able to produce 125 g of 999 pure protactinium processing 60 tons of waste material in a 12stage process and spending 500000 usd for many years to come this was the worlds only supply of the element it is reported that the metal was sold to laboratories for a cost of 2800 usd g in the following years

when pure the metal appears greyishwhite and firm the metal is corrosion resistant the catalytic properties of the six platinum family metals are outstanding for this catalytic property platinum is used in catalytic converters incorporated in automobile exhaust systems as well as tips of spark plugs
platinums wear and tarnishresistance characteristics are well suited for making fine jewellery platinum is more precious than gold the price of platinum changes along with its availability but its price is normally slightly less than 150 of the price of gold in the 18th century platinums rarity made king louis xv of france declare it the only metal fit for a king
platinum possesses high resistance to chemical attack excellent hightemperature characteristics and stable electrical properties all these properties have been exploited for industrial applications platinum does not oxidize in air at any temperature but can be corroded by cyanides halogens sulfur and caustic alkalis this metal is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid but does dissolve in the mixture known as aqua regia forming chloroplatinic acid common oxidation states of platinum include 2 and 4 the 1 and 3 oxidation states are less common and are often stabilized by metal bonding in bimetallic or polymetallic speciesthe gold is removed from this solution as a precipitate by treatment with ironii chloride fecl2 the platinum is precipitated out as impure nh42ptcl6 on treatment with nh4cl leaving h2ptcl4 in solution

naturallyoccurring platinum and platinumrich alloys have been known for a long time though the metal was used by precolumbian native americans the first european reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the italian humanist julius caesar scaliger 1484 1558 as a description of a mysterious metal found in central american mines between darién panama and mexico up until now impossible to melt by any of the spanish arts the word platinum comes from the spanish word platina meaning little silver
platinum was discussed by astronomer antonio de ulloa and don jorge juan y santacilia 1713 1773 both appointed by king philip v to join a geographical expedition in peru that lasted from 1735 to 1745 amongst other things ulloa observed the platina del pinto the unworkable metal found with gold in new granada colombia british privateers intercepted ulloas ship on the return voyage though he was welltreated in england and even made a member of the royal society he was prevented from publishing a reference to the unknown metal until 1748 before that could happen charles wood independently isolated the element in 1741 major finds were discovered in russia in 1819 which produced around 90 of the global platinum production at the turn of the 20th century
due to its rarity greater difficulty to work with and the need to alloy it with at the time an even more expensive metal iridium platinum was only used in a limited way in jewelry at the end of the 19th century this changed at beginning of the 20th century when most diamond ring mountings and most exclusive jewelry were almost completely made of platinum
platinum is an extremely rare metal occurring as only 0003 ppb in the earth s crust retailers claim supply estimates of this fine metal being 30 times rarer than gold that if all the worlds platinum reservoirs were poured into one olympic size swimming pool it would be scarcely deep enough to cover your ankles whereas gold would fill more than three such pools
in 2005 south africa was the top producer of platinum with almost 80 world share followed by russia and canada reports the british geological survey
platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and alloyed with iridium as platiniridium the platinum arsenide sperrylite ptas2 is a major source of platinum associated with nickel ores in the sudbury basin deposit in ontario canada the rare sulfide mineral cooperite ptpdnis contains platinum along with palladium and nickel cooperite occurs in the merensky reef within the bushveld complex gauteng south africa
platinum often accompanied by small amounts of other platinum family metals occurs in alluvial placer deposits in the witwatersrand of south africa the ural mountains and in the absoraka mountains in the american state of montana the only place it is found in the western hemisphere
platinum is produced commercially as a byproduct of nickel ore processing in the sudbury deposit the huge quantities of nickel ore processed makes up for the fact that platinum is present as only 05 ppm in the ore
platinum exists in relatively higher abundances on the moon and in meteorites corrospondingly platinum is found in slightly higher abundances at sites of bollide impact on the earth that are associated with resulting postimpact volcanism and can be mined economically the sudbury basin is one such example
according to the centers for disease control and prevention shortterm exposure to platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes nose and throat and longterm exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies the current osha standard is 0002 milligram per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8hour work shift
certain platinum complexes are used in chemotherapy and show good antitumor activity for some tumours cisplatin is particularly effective against testicular cancer cure rate was improved from 10 to 85 however the side effects are severe cisplatin causes cumulative irreversible kidney damage and deafness
as platinum is a catalyst in the manufacture of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants breast implants joint replacement prosthetics artificial lumbar discs vascular access ports the possibility that platinum free radicals could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study the fda and other countries have reviewed the issue and found no evidence to suggest toxicity in vivo
platinums rarity as a metal has caused advertisers to associate it with exclusivity and wealth platinum credit cards have greater privileges than do gold ones platinum awards are the second highest possible ranking above gold silver and bronze but below diamond for example in the united states a musical album that has sold more than 1000000 copies will be credited as platinum whereas an album that sold more than 10000000 copies will be certifed as diamond and some products such as blenders and vehicles with a silverywhite color are identified as platinum platinum is considered a precious metal although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver the frame of the crown of queen elizabeth the queen mother manufactured for her coronation as consort of king george vi is made of platinum it was the first british crown to be made of that metal
in order to obtain pure platinum the ore is crushed made into a slurry and then mixed with a detergent containing collector molecules air is then blown through the mixture enabling the grains of metal minerals to be separated from the rest of the mixture this process is called flotation the next step is smelting
in 2006 world supply of platinum was of about 217700 kg or 7 million troy ounces average platinum price in 2006 was of us1200 per troy ounce 40g representing a significant increase from the 2005 average of us900 per troy oz

when it is mixed or alloyed with beryllium polonium can be a neutron source beryllium releases a neutron upon absorption of an alpha particle that is supplied by 210po it has been used in this capacity as a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons other uses include devices that eliminate static charges in textile mills and other places however beta particle sources are more commonly used and are less dangerous a nonradioactive alternative is to use a highvoltage dc power supply to ionise air positively or negatively as required 210po can be used as an atomic heat source to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators via thermoelectric materials because of its very high toxicity polonium can be used as a poison see for example alexander litvinenko poisoning
also tentatively called radium f polonium was discovered by marie skłodowskacurie and her husband pierre curie in 1898 and was later named after marie curies native land of poland latin polonia poland at the time was under russian prussian and austrian partition and did not exist as an independent country it was curies hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy
this element was the first one discovered by the curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity the pitchblende after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium was more radioactive than both the uranium and thorium put together this spurred the curies on to find additional radioactive elements the curies first separated out polonium from the pitchblende and then within a few years also isolated radium
polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short halflife of all its isotopes it is found in uranium ores at about 100 micrograms per metric ton 1 part in 1010 which is approximately 02 of the abundance of radium the amounts in the earths crust are not harmful polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers though similar amount occur in everything from cherries to human tissue
in 1934 an experiment showed that when natural sup209supbi is bombarded with neutrons 210bi is created which then decays to 210po via β decay polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors only about 100 grams are produced each year practically all of it in russia making polonium exceedingly rare
it has been found that the longerlived isotopes of polonium can be formed by proton bombardment of bismuth using a cyclotron other more neutron rich isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with carbon nuclei
polonium has 25 known isotopes all of which are radioactive they have atomic masses that range from 194u to 218u 210po halflife 138376 days is the most widely available 209po halflife 103 years and 208po halflife 29 years can be made through the alpha proton or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron
210po is an alpha emitter that has a halflife of 138376 days it decays directly to its daughter isotope sup206suppb a milligram of 210po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 45 grams of sup226supra a few curies 1 curie equals 37 gigabecquerels of 210po emit a blue glow which is caused by excitation of surrounding air a single gram of 210po generates 140 watts of power because it emits many alpha particles which are stopped within a very short distance in dense media and release their energy 210po has been used as a lightweight heat source to power thermoelectric cells in artificial satellites for instance 210po heat source was also used in each of the lunokhod rovers deployed on the surface of the moon to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights some antistatic brushes contain up to 500 microcuries of 210po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity in materials like photographic film
the majority of the time 210po decays by emission of an alpha particle only not by emission of an alpha particle and a gamma ray about one in 100000 alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray this low gamma ray production rate and the short range of alpha particles makes it difficult to find and identify this isotope rather than gamma ray spectroscopy alpha spectroscopy is the best method of measuring this isotope
the chemistry of polonium is similar to that of tellurium and bismuth polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis the hydrogen compound poh2 is liquid at room temperature mp 361c to bp 353c halides of the structure pox2 pox4 and pox6 are known the two oxides poo2 and poo3 are the products of oxidation of polonium
210po in common with sup238suppu has the ability to become airborne with ease if a sample is heated in air to 328nbspk 55c 131f 50 of it is vaporized in 45 hours even though the melting point of polonium is 527nbspk 254c 489f and its boiling point is 1235nbspk 962c 1763f more than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are spalled off by the alpha decay
it has been reported that some microbes can methylate polonium by the action of methylcobalamin this is similar to the way in which mercury selenium and tellurium are methylated in living things to create organometallic compounds as a result when considering the biochemistry of polonium one should consider the possibility that the polonium will follow the same biochemical pathways as selenium and tellurium
the alpha form of solid polonium has a simple cubic crystal structure with an edge length of 3352 å
the beta form of polonium is rhombohedral it has been reported in the chemical literature along with the alpha form several times a picture of it is present on the web
two papers report xray diffraction experiments on polonium metal the first report of the crystal structure of polonium was done using electron diffraction
by means of radiometric methods such as gamma spectroscopy or a method using a chemical separation followed by an activity measurement with a nonenergydispersive counter it is possible to measure the concentrations of radioisotopes and to distinguish one from another in practice background noise would be present and depending on the detector the line width would be larger which would make it harder to identify and measure the isotope in biologicalmedical work it is common to use the natural sup40supk present in all tissuesbody fluids as a check of the equipment and as an internal standard
the best way to test for and measure many alpha emitters is to use alphaparticle spectroscopy as it is common to place a drop of the test solution on a metal disk which is then dried out to give a uniform coating on the disk this is then used as the test sample if the thickness of the layer formed on the disk is too thick then the lines of the spectrum are broadened this is because some of the energy of the alpha particles is lost during their movement through the layer of active material an alternative method is to use internal liquid scintillation where the sample is mixed with a scintillation cocktail when the light emitted is then counted some machines will record the amount of light energy per radioactive decay event due to the imperfections of the liquid scintillation method such as a failure for all the photons to be detected cloudy or coloured samples can be difficult to count and the fact that random quenching can reduce the number of photons generated per radioactive decay it is possible to get a broadening of the alpha spectra obtained through liquid scintillation it is likely that these liquid scintillation spectra will be subject to a gaussian broadening rather than the distortion exhibited when the layer of active material on a disk is too thick
a third energy dispersive method for counting alpha particles is to use a semiconductor detector
from left to right the peaks are due to 209po 210po 239pu and 241am the fact that isotopes such as sup239suppu and sup241supam have more than one alpha line indicates that the nucleus has the ability to be in different discrete energy levels like a molecule can
by mass polonium210 is around 250000 25105 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide the actual ldsub50sub for 210po is about 1 microgram for an 80 kg person see below compared to about 250 milligram for hydrogen cyanide the main hazard is its intense radioactivity as an alpha emitter which makes it very difficult to handle safely one gram of po will selfheat to a temperature of around 500 c even in microgram amounts handling 210po is extremely dangerous requiring specialized equipment and strict handling procedures alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested inhaled or absorbed though they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous if the polonium is outside the body
the median lethal dose ldsub50sub for acute radiation exposure is generally about 45 sv the committed effective dose equivalent 210po is 051 µsv bq if ingested and 25 µsvbq if inhaled since 210po has an activity of 166 tbq 44865 ci per gram is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose it has been estimated that a minimal lethal dose of 210po for an 80 kg person is 015 gbq 4 millicuries or 089 micrograms still an extremely small amount
in addition to the acute effects radiation exposure both internal and external carries a longterm risk of death from cancer of 510 per sv of the estimated 1500022000 lung cancer deaths in the us every year that have been attributed to indoor radon tobacco smoking causes significant additional exposure to po
the maximum allowable body burden for ingested 210po is only 1100 bq 003 microcurie which is equivalent to a particle weighing only 68 picograms the maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne 210po is about 10 bqm 3 1010 µcicm the target organs for polonium in humans are the spleen and liver as the spleen 150 g and the liver 13 to 3 kg are much smaller than the rest of the body if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered on average by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body in the same way as caesium or tritium as t2o
210po is widely used in industry and readily available with little regulation or restriction in the us a tracking system run by the nuclear regulatory commission will be implemented in 2007 to register purchases of more than 16 curies of polonium 210 enough to make up 5000 lethal doses the iaea is said to be considering tighter regulations there is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10 to 16 curies
notably the murder of alexander litvinenko a russian dissident in 2006 was announced as due to 210po poisoning see alexander litvinenko poisoning according to nick priest a radiation expert speaking on sky news on december 2 litvinenko was probably the first person ever to die of the acute αradiation effects of 210po
it has also been suggested that irène joliotcurie was the first person ever to die from the radiation effects of polonium due to a single intake in 1956 she was accidentally exposed to polonium in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench a decade later on 17 march 1956 she died in paris from leukemia which may or may not have been caused by that exposure
according to the book the bomb in the basement several death cases in israel during 19571969 were caused by 210po a leak was discovered at a weizmann institute laboratory in 1957 traces of 210po were found on the hands of prof dror sadeh a physicist who researched radioactive materials medical tests indicated no harm but the tests did not include bone marrow sadeh died from cancer one of his students died of leukemia and two colleagues died after a few years both from cancer the issue was investigated secretly and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed
it has been suggested that chelation agents such as british antilewisite dimercaprol can be used to decontaminate humans in one experiment rats were given a fatal dose of 145 mbqkg 87 ngkg of 210po all untreated rats were dead after 44 days but 90 of the rats treated with the chelation agent hoetttc remained alive after 5 months

rubidium is the second most electropositive of the stable alkali elements and liquefies at high ambient temperature 1027 f 393 c like other group 1 elements this metal reacts violently in water in common with potassium and caesium this reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite the liberated hydrogen rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air also like other alkali metals it forms amalgams with mercury and it can form alloys with gold caesium sodium and potassium the element gives a reddishviolet color to a flame hence its name
potential or current uses of rubidium include a boseeinstein condensate a working fluid in vapor turbines a getter in vacuum tubes a photocell component the resonant element in atomic clocks this is due to the hyperfine structure of rubidiums energy levels an ingredient in special types of glass the production of superoxide by burning in oxygen the study of potassium ion channels in biology rubidium vapor has been used to make atomic magnetometers 87rb is currently being used with other alkali metals in the development of spinexchange relaxationfree serf magnetometers
rubidium is easily ionized so it has been considered for use in ion engines for space vehicles but caesium and xenon are more efficient for this purpose
rubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color
rbagsub4subisub5sub has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal this property could be useful in thin film batteries and in other applications
rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field these conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current
rubidium particularly 87rb in the form of vapor is one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and boseeinstein condensation its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures
rubidium has been used for polarizing 3he that is producing volumes of magnetized 3he gas with the nuclear spins aligned toward a particular direction in space rather than randomly rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser and the polarized rb polarizes 3he by the hyperfine interaction spinpolarized 3he cells are becoming popular for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes
rubidium l rubidus deepest red was discovered in 1861 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope however this element had minimal industrial use until the 1920s historically the most important use for rubidium has been in research and development primarily in chemical and electronic applications
rubidium is about the sixteenth most abundant metal in the earths crust roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite and zinnwaldite which contains traces of up to 1 of its oxide lepidolite contains 15 rubidium and this is the commercial source of the element some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant amounts one notable source is also in the extensive deposits of pollucite at bernic lake manitoba
rubidium metal can be produced by reducing rubidium chloride with calcium among other methods in 1997 the cost of this metal in small quantities was about us 25 gram
there are 24 isotopes of rubidium known with naturally occurring rubidium being composed of just two isotopes rb85 722 and the radioactive rb87 278 natural rubidium is radioactive with specific activity of about 670 bq g enough to fog photographic film in approximately 30 to 60 days
rb87 has a halflife of 488times1010 years it readily substitutes for potassium in minerals and is therefore fairly widespread rb has been used extensively in dating rocks rb87 decays to stable strontium 87 by emission of a negative beta particle during fractional crystallization sr tends to become concentrated in plagioclase leaving rb in the liquid phase hence the rbsr ratio in residual magma may increase over time resulting in rocks with increasing rbsr ratios with increasing differentiation highest ratios 10 or higher occur in pegmatites if the initial amount of sr is known or can be extrapolated the age can be determined by measurement of the rb and sr concentrations and the sr87sr86 ratio the dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered see rubidiumstrontium dating for a more detailed discussion
rubidium chloride is probably the mostused rubidium compound it is used in biochemistry to induce cells to take up dna and as a biomarker since it is readily taken up to replace potassium and does not normally occur in living organisms rubidium hydroxide is the starting material for most rubidiumbased chemical processes rubidium carbonate is used in some optical glasses
rubidium has a number of oxides including rb6o and rb9o2 which appear if rubidium metal is left exposed to air the final product of reacting with oxygen is the superoxide rbo2 rubidium forms salts with most anions some common rubidium compounds are rubidium chloride rbcl rubidium monoxide rb2o and rubidium copper sulfate rb2so4cuso46h20 a compound of rubidium silver and iodine rbag4i5 has interesting electrical characteristics and might be useful in thin film batteries
rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires to ensure both health and safety and purity this element must be kept under a dry mineral oil in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere
rubidium like sodium and potassium is almost always in its 1 oxidation state the human body tends to treat rb ions as if they were potassium ions and therefore concentrates rubidium in the bodys electrolytic fluid the ions are not particularly toxic and are relatively quickly removed in the sweat and urine however taken in excess it can be dangerous

the heaviest of the alkaline earth metals radium is intensely radioactive and resembles barium in its chemical behavior this metal is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore pitchblende and various other uranium minerals radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a higher temperature than their surroundings and for their radiations which are of three kinds alpha particles beta particles and gamma rays radium also produces neutrons when mixed with beryllium
when freshly prepared pure radium metal is brilliant white but blackens when exposed to air probably due to nitride formation radium is luminescent giving a faint blue color reacts violently with water and oil to form radium hydroxide and is slightly more volatile than barium the normal phase of radium is a solid
some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties more recently discovered radioisotopes such as sup60supco and sup137supcs are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters safer to handle and available in more concentrated form
when mixed with beryllium it is a neutron source for physics experiments
radium was formerly used in selfluminous paints for watches nuclear panels aircraft switches clocks and instrument dials more than 100 former watch dial painters who used their lips to shape the paintbrush died from the radiation soon afterward the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known radium was still used in dials as late as the 1950s although tritiums beta radiation is potentially dangerous if ingested it has replaced radium in these applications
during the 1930s it was found that workers exposure to radium by handling luminescent paints caused serious health effects which included sores anemia and bone cancer this use of radium was stopped soon afterward this is because radium is treated as calcium by the body and deposited in the bones where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells the litigation and ultimate deaths of five radium girl employees who had used radiumbased luminous paints on the dials of watches and clocks had a significant impact on the formulation of occupational disease labor law
radium was also put in some foods for taste and as a preservative but also exposed many people to radiation radium was once an additive in products like toothpaste hair creams and even food items due to its supposed curative powers such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects see for instance radithor spas featuring radiumrich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial such as those in misasa tottori japan

rhenium latin rhenus meaning rhine was the nexttolast naturally occurring element to be discovered and the last element to be discovered having a stable isotope the existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been predicted by henry moseley in 1914 it is generally considered to have been discovered by walter noddack ida tacke and otto berg in germany in 1925 they reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite they also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite in 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660 kg of molybdenite
the process was so complicated and the cost so high that production was discontinued until early 1950 when tungstenrhenium and molybdenumrhenium alloys were prepared these alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the rhenium produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry copper ores
in 1908 japanese chemist masataka ogawa announced that he discovered the 43rd element and named it nipponium np after japan which is nippon in japanese however later analysis indicated the presence of rhenium element 75 not element 43 the symbol np was later used for the element neptunium

essentially chemically inert but radioactive radon is the heaviest noble gas and one of the heaviest gases at room temperature at standard temperature and pressure radon is a colorless gas but when it is cooled below its freezing point 202 k 71 c 96 f it has a brilliant phosphorescence which turns yellow as the temperature is lowered and becomes orange red at the temperatures air liquefies below 93 k 180 c
natural radon concentrations in earths atmosphere are so low that radonrich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization hence ground water has a higher concentration of 222rn than surface water because the radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of 226 ra present in rocks likewise the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere radon is a health hazard exposure can cause lung cancer
radon named after radium was discovered in 1900 by friedrich ernst dorn who called it radium emanation in 1908 william ramsay and robert whytlawgray named it niton latin nitens meaning shining symbol nt and isolated it determined its density and determined that it was the heaviest known gas it has been called radon since 1923
the first major studies of the health concern occurred in the context of uranium mining first in the joachimsthal region of bohemia and then in the southwestern united states during the early cold war because radon is a product of uranium uranium mines may have high concentrations of radon and its highly radioactive daughter products many uranium miners in the four corners region contracted lung cancer and other pathologies as a result of high levels of exposure to radon in the mid1950s the increased incidence of lung cancer was particularly pronounced among native american and mormon miners because those groups normally have low rates of lung cancer safety standards requiring expensive ventilation were not widely implemented or policed during that period
the danger of radon exposure in dwellings was discovered in 1984 with the case of stanley watras an employee at the limerick nuclear power plant in pennsylvania watras set off the radiation alarms on his way into work for two weeks straight while authorities searched for the source of the contamination they were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon around 100000 bq m 2700 pci l in his houses basement and it was not related to the nuclear plant the risks associated with living in his house were estimated to be equivalent to smoking 135 packs of cigarettes every day following this event which was highly publicized national radon safety standards were set and radon detection and ventilation became a standard homeowner concern
radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking and radoninduced lung cancer is thought to be the 6th leading cause of cancer death overall
on average there is one atom of radon in 1 x 1021 molecules of air radon can be found in some spring waters and hot springs the towns of boulder montana and misasa bad kreuznach germany as well as the country of japan boast radiumrich springs which emit radon
radon emanates naturally from the ground all over the world particularly in regions with soils containing granite or shale however not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon depending on how houses are built and ventilated radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings the highest average radon concentrations in counties in the us are found in iowa and in the appalachian mountain areas in southeastern pennsylvania some of the highest readings ever have been recorded in the irish town of mallow county cork prompting local fears regarding lung cancer
radon along with other noble gases krypton and xenon is also produced during the operation of nuclear power plants a small fraction of it leaks out of the fuel through the cladding and into the cooling water from which it is scavenged it is then routed to a holding tank where it remains for a large number of halflives it is finally purged to the open air through a tall stack which is carefully monitored for radiation level
the european union recommends that action should be taken starting from concentrations of 400 bqm 11 pcil for old houses and 200 bqm 5 pcil for new ones after publication of the north american and european pooling studies health canada has proposed a new guideline that lowers their action level from 800 to 200 bqm 22 to 5 pcil the united states environmental protection agency epa strongly recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 148 bqm 4 pci l and encourages action starting at 74 bqm 2 pci l epa radon risk level tables including comparisons to other risks encountered in life are available in their citizens guide nearly one in 15 homes in the us has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics the us surgeon general and epa recommend all homes be tested for radon
radon emitted from the ground has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a meteorological inversion and little wind
in 1971 apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the aristarchus plateau on the moon and detected a significant rise in alpha particles thought to be caused by the decay of radon222 the lunar prospector later confirmed the emissions
as a noble gas radon is highly unreactive however some experiments indicate that fluorine can react with radon and form radon fluoride radon oxides have also been reported
there are twenty known isotopes of radon the most stable isotope is 222rn which is a decay product daughter product of 226ra has a halflife of 3823 days and emits alpha particles 220rn is a natural decay product of thorium and is called thoron it has a halflife of 556 seconds and also emits alpha radiation 219rn is derived from actinium is called actinon is an alpha emitter and has a halflife of 396 seconds

in the united states and europe there are a few radon spas where people sit for minutes or hours in a highradon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them in addition personal testimonies of arthritis relief and other benefits there is some very limited scientific evidence for this belief known as hormesis however the general scientific community finds it unsubstantiated there is no known biological mechanism by which such an effect could occur in addition it conflicts with the internationally recognized standard that there is no safe threshold for radiation exposure and that exposure should be limited to that as low as reasonably achievable alara
radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in jáchymov czech republic but even before radon discovery they were used in bad gastein austria hot radiumrich spring releasing radon is also used in traditional japanese onsen in misasa tottori prefecture drinking therapy is applied in bad brambach germany inhalation therapy is carried out in gasteinerheilstollen austria in kowary poland and in boulder montana united states
because of radons rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay radon is used in hydrologic research that studies the interaction between ground water and streams any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of ground water
some researchers have looked at elevated soilgas radon concentrations or rapid changes in soil or groundwater radon concentrations as a predictor for earthquakes results have been generally unconvincing but may ultimately prove to have some limited use in specific locations
radon soilconcentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried closesubsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults similarly it has found some limited use in geothermal prospecting
radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree this fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists
radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations though it disperses rapidly and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations the trend in geothermal plants is to reinject all emissions by pumping deep underground and this seems likely to ultimately decrease such radon hazards further radon is also used in the dating of oilcontaining soils because radon has a high affinity of oillike substances
the general effects of radon to the human body are caused by its radioactivity and consequent risk of radiationinduced cancer as an inert gas radon has a low solubility in body fluids which lead to a uniform distribution of the gas throughout the body radon gas and its solid decay products are carcinogens the greatest health risks come from exposure to the inhaled solid radon gas decay products that are produced during the radioactive decay of radon gas two of these decay products polonium 218 and 214 present a significant radiologic hazard once the radioactive decay products are inhaled into the lung they undergo further radioactive decay releasing small bursts of energy in the form of alpha particles that can either cause dna breaks or create free radicals
based on studies carried out by the national academy of sciences in the united states radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking accounting for 15000 to 22000 cancer deaths per year in the us the surgeon general of the united states has reported that over 20000 americans die each year of radonrelated lung cancer the united states environmental protection agency epa recommends homes be fixed if an occupants longterm exposure will average 4 picocuries per liter pcil 148 bq m3 or higher

it is unknown whether radon causes other types of cancer but recent studies suggest a need for further studies to assess the relationship between radon and leukemia
astm e2121 is a standard for reducing radon in homes as far as practicable below 4 picocuries per liter pcil in indoor air
radon test kits are commercially available the kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days the user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis the national environmental health association provides a list of radon measurement professionals long term kits taking collections for up to one year are also available an open land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins the epa and the national environmental health association have identified 15 types of radon testing a lucas cell is one type of device
radon levels fluctuate naturally an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of your homes average radon level transient weather can affect short term measurements therefore a high result over 4 pcl justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects measurements between 4 and 10 pcl warrant a long term radon test measurements over 10 pcl warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pcl or less
the national environmental health association administers a voluntary national radon proficiency program for radon professionals consisting of individuals and companies wanting to take training courses and examinations to demonstrate their competency a list of mitigation service providers is available indoor radon can be mitigated by sealing basement foundations water drainage or by subslab depressurization in severe cases mitigation can use air pipes and fans to exhaust subslab air to the outside indoor ventilation systems are more effective but exterior ventilation can be costeffective in some cases modern construction that conserves energy by making homes air tight exacerbates the risks of radon exposure if radon is present in the home older homes with more porous construction are more likely to vent radon naturally ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside homes built on a crawl space can benefit from a radon collector installed under a radon barrier a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space

this element therefore has no applications and little is known about it rutherfordium is the first transactinide element and it is predicted to have chemical properties similar to hafnium
rutherfordium was reportedly first synthesized in 1964 at the joint nuclear research institute at dubna ussr researchers there bombarded 242 pu with accelerated 113 to 115 mev 22 ne ions and claimed that they detected nuclear fission tracks in a special type of glass with a microscope which indicated the presence of a new element
in 1969 researchers at the university of california berkeley synthesized the element by subjecting 249 cf and 12 c to high energy collisions the uc group also stated that they could not reproduce the earlier synthesis by soviet scientists
this resulted in an element naming controversy since the soviets claimed that it was first detected in dubna dubnium db was suggested as was kurchatovium symbol ku for element 104 in honor of igor vasilevich kurchatov 1903 1960 former head of soviet nuclear research the americans however proposed rutherfordium rf for the new element to honor ernest rutherford who is known as the father of nuclear physics the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted unnilquadium symbol unq as a temporary systematic element name derived from the latin names for digits 1 0 and 4 however in 1997 they resolved the dispute and adopted the current name element 105 was named dubnium instead
webelementscom rutherfordium sodium is a chemical element which has the symbol na latin natrium atomic number 11 atomic mass 229898 gmol common oxidation number 1 sodium is a soft silvery white highly reactive element and is a member of the alkali metals within group 1 formerly known as group ia it has only one stable isotope 23na sodium was first isolated by sir humphry davy in 1807 by passing an electric current through molten sodium hydroxide sodium quickly oxidizes in air and is violently reactive with water so it must be stored in an inert medium such as kerosene sodium is present in great quantities in the earths oceans as sodium chloride it is also a component of many minerals and it is an essential element for animal life as such it is classified as a dietary inorganic macromineral
compared with other alkali metals sodium is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium in accordance with periodic law for example their reaction in water chlorine gas etc the reactivity of their nitrates chlorates perchlorates etc the density of elements generally increase with increasing atomic number but potassium is less dense than sodium
owing to its high reactivity sodium is found in nature only as a compound and never as the free element sodium reacts exothermically with water small peasized pieces will bounce across the surface of the water until they are consumed by it whereas large pieces will explode while sodium reacts with water at room temperature the sodium piece melts with the heat of the reaction to form a sphere if the reacting sodium piece is large enough the reaction with water produces very caustic sodium hydroxide and highly flammable hydrogen gas these are extreme hazards see precautions section below when burned in air sodium forms sodium peroxide na2o2 or with limited oxygen the oxide na2o unlike lithium the nitride is not formed if burned in oxygen under pressure sodium superoxide nao2 will be produced
when sodium or its compounds are introduced into a flame it will contribute a bright yellow colour
at room temperature pure sodium is so soft that it can be easily cut with a butter knife in air the bright silvery luster of freshly exposed sodium will rapidly tarnish
in chemistry most sodium compounds are considered soluble but nature provides examples of many insoluble sodium compounds such as the feldspars there are other insoluble sodium salts such as sodium bismuthate nabio3 sodium octamolybdate na2mo8o25 4h2o sodium thioplatinate na4pt3s6 sodium uranate na2uo4 sodium metaantimonate s 2nasbo37h2o solubility is 03gl as is the pyro form na2h2sb2o7 h2o of this salt sodium metaphosphate napo3 has a soluble and an insoluble form
sodium ions are necessary for regulation of blood and body fluids transmission of nerve impulses heart activity and certain metabolic functions interestingly sodium is needed by animals which maintain high concentrations in their blood and extracellular fluids but the ion is not needed by plants a completely plantbased diet therefore will be very low in sodium this requires some herbivores to obtain their sodium from salt licks and other mineral sources the animal need for sodium is probably the reason for the highlyconserved ability to taste the sodium ion as salty receptors for the pure salty taste respond best to sodium otherwise only to a few other small monovalent cations li nh4 and somewhat to k calcium ion ca2 also tastes salty and sometimes bitter to some people but like potassium can trigger other tastes
the most common sodium salt sodium chloride table salt used for seasoning for example the english word salad refers to salt and warmclimate food preservation such as pickling and making jerky the high osmotic content of salt inhibits bacterial and fungal growth as such salt has been an important commodity in human activities the english word salary refers to salarium the wafers of salt sometimes given to roman solders along with their other wages the human requirement for sodium in the diet is about 500nbspmg per day which is typically less than a tenth as much as many diets seasoned to taste most people consume far more sodium than is physiologically needed for certain people with saltsensitive blood pressure this extra intake may cause a negative effect on health
sodium in its metallic form can be used to refine some reactive metals such as zirconium and potassium from their compounds this alkali metal as the na ion is vital to animal life other uses in certain alloys to improve their structure in soap in combination with fatty acids sodium soaps are harder higher melting soaps than potassium soaps to descale metal make its surface smooth to purify molten metals
in sodium vapor lamps an efficient means of producing light from electricity see the picture often used for street lighting in cities lowpressure sodium lamps give a distinctive yelloworange light which consists primarily of the twin sodium d lines highpressure sodium lamps give a more natural peachcolored light composed of wavelengths spread much more widely across the spectrum as a heat transfer fluid in some types of nuclear reactors and inside the hollow valves of highperformance internal combustion engines nacl a compound of sodium ions and chloride ions is an important heat transfer material in organic synthesis sodium is used as a reducing agent for example in the birch reduction in chemistry sodium is often used either alone or with potassium in an alloy nak as a desiccant for drying solvents used with benzophenone it forms an intense blue coloration when the solvent is dry and oxygen free
sodium sometimes called soda in english has long been recognized in compounds but was not isolated until 1807 by sir humphry davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda in medieval europe a compound of sodium with the latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy
sodiums chemical abbreviation na was first published by jöns jakob berzelius in his system of atomic symbols thomas thomsons annals of philosophy and is a contraction of the elements new latin name natrium which refers to natron a natural mineral salt whose primary ingredient is hydrated sodium carbonate and which historically had several important industrial and household uses later eclipsed by soda ash baking soda and other sodium compounds
sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames as early as 1860 kirchhoff and bunsen noted the high sensitivity that a flame test for sodium could give they state in annalen der physik und der chemie in the paper chemical analysis by observation of spectra
in a corner of our 60 cum room farthest away from the apparatus we exploded 3nbspmg of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit after a while it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes from the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 120 millionth weight of sodium
sodium is relatively abundant in stars and the d spectral lines of this element are among the most prominent in star light sodium makes up about 26 by weight of the earth s crust making it the fourth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal
at the end of the 19th century sodium was chemically prepared by heating sodium carbonate with carbon to 1100nbspc na2co3 liquid 2 c solid 2 na vapor 3 co gas
it is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of liquid sodium chloride this is done in a downs cell in which the nacl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700nbspc as calcium is less electropositive than sodium no calcium will be formed at the anode this method is less expensive than the previous castner process of electrolyzing sodium hydroxide
very pure sodium can be isolated by the thermal decomposition of sodium azide
metallic sodium costs about 15 to 20 us cents per pound us030kg to us045kg in 1997 but reagent grade acs sodium cost about us35 per pound us75kg in 1990
under extreme pressure sodium departs from common melting behavior most materials require higher temperatures to melt under pressure than they do at normal atmospheric pressure this is because they expand on melting due to looser molecular packing in the liquid and thus pressure forces equilibrium in the direction of the denser solid phase
at a pressure of 30 gigapascals 300000 times sea level atmospheric pressure the melting temperature of sodium begins to drop at around 100 gigapascals sodium will melt at near room temperature a possible explanation for the aberrant behavior of sodium is that this element has one free electron that is pushed closer to the other 10 electrons when placed under pressure forcing interactions that are not normally present while under pressure solid sodium assumes several odd crystal structures suggesting that the liquid might have unusual properties such as superconduction or superfluidity
sodium chloride or halite better known as common salt is the most common compound of sodium but sodium occurs in many other minerals such as amphibole cryolite soda niter and zeolite sodium compounds are important to the chemical glass metal paper petroleum soap and textile industries hard soaps are generally sodium salt of certain fatty acids potassium produces softer or liquid soaps the sodium compounds that are the most important to industries are common salt na cl soda ash na2 c o 3 baking soda na hco 3 caustic soda naoh sodium nitrate na no 3 di and trisodium phosphates sodium thiosulfate hypo na2 s 2o3 5h2o and borax na2 b 4o7 10h2o
there are thirteen isotopes of sodium that have been recognized the only stable isotope is 23na sodium has two radioactive cosmogenic isotopes 22na halflife 2605 years and 24na halflife 15 hours
acute neutron radiation exposure eg from a nuclear criticality accident converts some of the stable 23na in human blood plasma to 24na by measuring the concentration of this isotope the neutron radiation dosage to the victim can be computed
extreme care is required in handling elementalmetallic sodium sodium is potentially explosive in water depending on quantity and is a caustic poison since it is rapidly converted to sodium hydroxide on contact with moisture the powdered form may combust spontaneously in air or oxygen sodium must be stored either in an inert oxygen and moisture free atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon or under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene
the reaction of sodium and water is a familiar one in chemistry labs and is reasonably safe if amounts of sodium smaller than a pencil eraser are used and the reaction is done behind a plastic shield by people wearing eye protection however the sodiumwater reaction does not scale up well and is treacherous when larger amounts of sodium are used larger pieces of sodium melt under the heat of the reaction and the molten ball of metal is buoyed up by hydrogen and may appear to be stably reacting with water until splashing covers more of the reaction mass causing thermal runaway and an explosion which scatters molten sodium lye solution and sometimes flame 185 g explosion this behavior is unpredictable and among the alkali metals it is usually sodium which invites this surprise phenomenon because lithium is not reactive enough to do it and potassium is so reactive that chemistry students are not tempted to try the reaction with larger potassium pieces
sodium is much more reactive than magnesium a reactivity which can be further enhanced due to sodiums much lower melting point when sodium catches fire in air as opposed to just the hydrogen gas generated from water by means of its reaction with sodium it more easily produces temperatures high enough to melt the sodium exposing more of its surface to the air and spreading the fire
few common fire extinguishers work on sodium fires water of course exacerbates sodium fires as do waterbased foams co2 and halon are often ineffective on sodium fires which reignite when the extinguisher dissipates among the very few materials effective on a sodium fire are pyromet and metlx pyromet is a naclnh42hpo4 mix with flowanticlump agents it smothers the fire drains away heat and melts to form an impermeable crust this is the standard drypowder canister fire extinguisher for all classes of fires metlx is mostly sodium chloride nacl with approximately 5 saran plastic as a crustformer and flowanticlumping agents it is most commonly handapplied with a scoop other extreme fire extinguishing materials include lith a graphite based dry powder with an organophosphate flame retardant and na a na2co3based material
because of the reaction scale problems discussed above disposing of large quantities of sodium more than 10 to 100 grams must be done through a licensed hazardous materials disposer smaller quantities may be broken up and neutralized carefully with ethanol which has a much slower reaction than water or even methanol where the reaction is more rapid than ethanols but still less than in water but care should nevertheless be taken as the caustic products from the ethanol or methanol reaction are just as hazardous to eyes and skin as those from water after the alcohol reaction appears complete and all pieces of reaction debris have been broken up or dissolved a mixture of alcohol and water then pure water may then be carefully used for a final cleaning this should be allowed to stand a few minutes until the reaction products are diluted more thoroughly and flushed down the drain the purpose of the final water soak and wash of any reaction mass which may contain sodium is to ensure that alcohol does not carry unreacted sodium into the sink trap where a water reaction may generate hydrogen in the trap space which can then be potentially ignited causing a confined sink trap explosion
sodium ions play a diverse and important role in many physiological processes excitable animal cells for example rely on the entry of na to cause a depolarization an example of this is signal transduction in the human central nervous system which depends on sodium ion motion across the nerve cell membrane in all nerves
some potent neurotoxins such as batrachotoxin increase the sodium ion permeability of the cell membranes in nerves and muscles causing a massive and irreversible depolarization of the membranes with potentially fatal consequences however drugs with smaller effects on sodium ion motion in nerves may have diverse pharmacological effects which range from antidepressant to antiseizure actions
sodium is the primary cation positive ion in extracellular fluids in animals and humans these fluids such as blood plasma and extracellular fluids in other tissues bathe cells and carry out transport functions for nutrients and wastes sodium is also the principal cation in seawater although the concentration there is about 38 times what it is normally in extracellular body fluids
although the system for maintaining optimal salt and water balance in the body is a complex one one of the primary ways in which the human body keeps track of loss of body water is that osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense a balance of sodium and water concentration in extracellular fluids relative loss of body water will cause sodium concentration to rise higher than normal a condition known as hypernatremia this ordinarily results in thirst conversely an excess of body water caused by drinking will result in too little sodium in the blood hyponatremia a condition which is again sensed by the hypothalamus causing a decrease in vasopressin hormone secretion from the posterior pituitary and a consequent loss of water in the urine which acts to restore blood sodium concentrations to normal
severely dehydrated persons such as people rescued from ocean or desert survival situations usually have very high blood sodium concentrations these must be very carefully and slowly returned to normal since toorapid correction of hypernatremia may result in brain damage from cellular swelling as water moves suddenly into cells with high osmolar content
because the hypothalamus osmoreceptor system ordinarily works well to cause drinking or urination to restore the bodys sodium concentrations to normal this system can be used in medical treatment to regulate the bodys total fluid content by first controlling the bodys sodium content thus when a powerful diuretic drug is given which causes the kidneys to excrete sodium the effect is accompanied by an excretion of body water water loss accompanies sodium loss this happens because the kidney is unable to efficiently retain water while excreting large amounts of sodium in addition after sodium excretion the osmoreceptor system may sense lowered sodium concentration in the blood and then direct compensatory urinary water loss in order to correct the hyponatremic low blood sodium state
in humans a highsalt intake was demonstrated to attenuate nitric oxide production nitric oxide no contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium
one notable atomic spectral line of sodium vapor is the socalled dline which may be observed directly as the sodium flametest line see above and also the major light output of lowpressure sodium lamps these produce an unnatural yellow rather than the peachcolored glow of high pressure lamps the dline is one of the classified fraunhofer lines observed in the visible spectrum of the suns electromagnetic radiation sodium vapor in the upper layers of the sun creates a dark line in the emitted spectrum of electromagnetic radiation by absorbing visible light in a band of wavelengths around 5895nbspnm this wavelength corresponds to transitions in atomic sodium in which the valenceelectron transitions from a 3p to 3s electronic state closer examination of the visible spectrum of atomic sodium reveals that the dline actually consists of two lines called the d1 and d2 lines at 5898nbspnm and 5892nbspnm respectively this fine structure results from a spinorbit interaction of the valence electron in the 3p electronic state the spinorbit interaction couples the spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum of a 3p electron to form two states that are respectively notated as and in the ls coupling scheme the 3s state of the electron gives rise to a single state which is notated as in the ls coupling scheme the d1line results from an electronic transition between lower state and upper state the d2line results from an electronic transition between lower state and upper state even closer examination of the visible spectrum of atomic sodium would reveal that the dline actually consists of a lot more than two lines these lines are associated with hyperfine structure of the 3p upper states and 3s lower states many different transitions involving visible light near 5895nbspnm may occur between the different upper and lower hyperfine levels

silicon has many industrial uses elemental silicon is the principal component of most semiconductor devices most importantly integrated circuits or microchips silicon is widely used in semiconductors because it remains a semiconductor at higher temperatures than the semiconductor germanium and because its native oxide is easily grown in a furnace and forms a better semiconductordielectric interface than almost all other material combinations

silicon is an essential element in biology although only tiny traces of it appear to be required by animals it is much more important to the metabolism of plants particularly many grasses and silicic acid a type of silica forms the basis of the striking array of protective shells of the microscopic diatoms
the outer electron orbitals half filled subshell holding up to eight electrons have the same structure as in carbon and the two elements are very similar chemically even though it is a relatively inert element silicon still reacts with halogens and dilute alkalis but most acids except for some hyperreactive combinations of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid do not affect it having four bonding electrons however gives it like carbon many opportunities to combine with other elements or compounds under the right circumstances
both silicon and carbon are semiconductors readily either donating or sharing their four outer electrons allowing many different forms of chemical bonding pure silicon has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance since the number of free charge carriers increases with temperature the electrical resistance of single crystal silicon significantly changes under the application of mechanical stress due to the piezoresistive effect
in its crystalline form pure silicon has a gray color and a metallic luster it is similar to glass in that it is rather strong very brittle and prone to chipping
measured by mass silicon makes up 257 of the earth s crust and is the second most abundant element on earth after oxygen pure silicon crystals are only occasionally found in nature they can be found as inclusions with gold and in volcanic exhalations silicon is usually found in the form of silicon dioxide also known as silica and silicate
silica occurs in minerals consisting of practically pure silicon dioxide in different crystalline forms sand amethyst agate quartz rock crystal chalcedony flint jasper and opal are some of the forms in which silicon dioxide appears they are known as lithogenic as opposed to biogenic silicas

the largest application of pure silicon metallurgical grade silicon is in aluminium silicon alloys often called light alloys to produce cast parts mainly for automotive industry this represents about 55 of the world consumption of pure silicon steel and cast iron silicon is an important constituent of some steels and it is used in the production process of cast iron it is introduced as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys
pure silicon is also used to produce ultrapure silicon for electronic and photovoltaic applications semiconductor ultrapure silicon can be doped with other elements to adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge positive or negative of current carriers such control is necessary for transistors solar cells microprocessors semiconductor detectors and other semiconductor devices which are used in electronics and other hightech applications photonics silicon can be used as a continuous wave raman laser to produce coherent light though it is ineffective as a light source lcds and solar cells hydrogenated amorphous silicon is widely used in the production of lowcost largearea electronics in applications such as lcds it has also shown promise for largearea lowcost thinfilm solar cells

in 2005 metallurgical grade silicon cost about 077 per pound 170kg
the use of silicon in semiconductor devices demands a much greater purity than afforded by metallurgical grade silicon historically a number of methods have been used to produce highpurity silicon
early silicon purification techniques were based on the fact that if silicon is melted and resolidified the last parts of the mass to solidify contain most of the impurities the earliest method of silicon purification first described in 1919 and used on a limited basis to make radar components during world war ii involved crushing metallurgical grade silicon and then partially dissolving the silicon powder in an acid when crushed the silicon cracked so that the weaker impurityrich regions were on the outside of the resulting grains of silicon as a result the impurityrich silicon was the first to be dissolved when treated with acid leaving behind a more pure product
in zone melting also called zone refining the first silicon purification method to be widely used industrially rods of metallurgical grade silicon are heated to melt at one end then the heater is slowly moved down the length of the rod keeping a small length of the rod molten as the silicon cools and resolidifies behind it since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than resolidify when the process is complete most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted this end is then cut off and discarded and the process repeated if a still higher purity is desired
today silicon is purified by converting it to a silicon compound that can be more easily purified than in its original state and then converting that silicon element back into pure silicon trichlorosilane is the silicon compound most commonly used as the intermediate although silicon tetrachloride and silane are also used when these gases are blown over silicon at high temperature they decompose to highpurity silicon
at one time dupont produced ultrapure silicon by reacting silicon tetrachloride with highpurity zinc vapors at 950 c producing silicon according to the chemical equation

however this technique was plagued with practical problems such as the zinc chloride byproduct solidifying and clogging lines and was eventually abandoned in favor of the siemens process
in the siemens process highpurity silicon rods are exposed to trichlorosilane at 1150 c the trichlorosilane gas decomposes and deposits additional silicon onto the rods enlarging them according to chemical reactions like

the majority of silicon crystals grown for device production are produced by the czochralski process czsi since it is the cheapest method available and it is capable of producing large size crystals however silicon singlecrystals grown by the czochralski method contain impurities since the crucible which contains the melt dissolves for certain electronic devices particularly those required for high power applications silicon grown by the czochralski method is not pure enough for these applications floatzone silicon fzsi can be used instead it is worth mentioning though in contrast with czsi method in which the seed is dipped into the silicon melt and the growing crystal is pulled upward the thin seed crystal in the fzsi method sustains the growing crystal as well as the polysilicon rod from the bottom as a result it is difficult to grow large size crystals using the floatzone method today all the dislocationfree silicon crystals used in semiconductor industry with diameter 300mm or larger are grown by the czochralski method with purity level significantly improved

since silicon is similar to carbon particularly in its valency some people have proposed the possibility of siliconbased life one main detraction for siliconbased life is that unlike carbon silicon does not have the tendency to form double and triple bonds
although there are no known forms of life that rely entirely on siliconbased chemistry there are some that rely on silicon minerals for specific functions some bacteria and other forms of life such as the protozoa radiolaria have silicon dioxide skeletons and the sea urchin has spines made of silicon dioxide these forms of silicon dioxide are known as biogenic silica silicate bacteria use silicates in their metabolism
life as we know it could not have developed based on a silicon biochemistry the main reason for this fact is that life on earth depends on the carbon cycle autotrophic entities use carbon dioxide to synthesize organic compounds with carbon which is then used as food by heterotrophic entities which produce energy and carbon dioxide from these compounds if carbon was to be replaced with silicon there would be a need for a silicon cycle however silicon dioxide precipitates in aqueous systems and cannot be transported among living beings by common biological means
as such another solvent would be necessary to sustain siliconbased life forms it would be difficult if not impossible to find another common compound with the unusual properties of water which make it an ideal solvent for carbonbased life larger silicon compounds analogous to common hydrocarbon chains silanes are also generally unstable owing to the larger atomic radius of silicon and the correspondingly weaker siliconsilicon bond silanes decompose readily and often violently in the presence of oxygen making them unsuitable for an oxidizing atmosphere such as our own silicon also does not readily participate in pibonding the second and third bonds in triple bonds and double bonds are pibonds as its porbital electrons experience greater shielding and are less able to take on the necessary geometry furthermore although some silicon rings cyclosilanes analogous to common the cycloalkanes formed by carbon have been synthesized these are largely unknown their synthesis suffers from the difficulties inherent in producing any silane compound whereas carbon will readily form five six and sevenmembered rings by a variety of pathways the dielsalder reaction is one naturallyoccurring example even in the presence of oxygen silicons inability to readily form long silane chains multiple bonds and rings severely limits the diversity of compounds that can be synthesized from it under known conditions silicon chemistry simply cannot begin to approach the diversity of organic chemistry a crucial factor in carbons role in biology
however siliconbased life could be construed as being life which exists under a computational substrate this concept is yet to be explored in mainstream technology but receives ample coverage by scifi authors
a g cairnssmith has proposed that the first living organisms to exist were forms of clay mineralswhich were probably based around the silicon atom
silicon was first identified by antoine lavoisier in 1787 as a component of the latin or silicis meaning what were more generally termed the flints or hard rocks during the early modern era where nowadays as we would say silica or silicates and was later mistaken by humphry davy in 1800 for a compound in 1811 gaylussac and thénard probably prepared impure amorphous silicon through the heating of potassium with silicon tetrafluoride it was first discovered as an element by berzelius in 1823 in 1824 berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as lussac berzelius also purified the product by repeatedly washing it

scandium is a rare hard silvery rough very dark metallic element that develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when exposed to air it is not resistant to weathering when pure and is destroyed on prolonged contact with most dilute acids however like some other reactive metals this metal is not attacked by a 11 mixture of nitric acid h n o 3 and hydrofluoric acid h f
the rarity of scandium is not an arbitrary fact the thermonuclear reactions that produce the elements in this range of atomic numbers tend to produce much greater quantities of elements with an even atomic number these elements were usually produced by the fusion of lighter elements with helium 4 nuclei starting with carbon 12 element six thus the common elements in the range of scandium are atomic numbers 18 argon 20 calcium 22 titanium and 24 chromium with elements with odd atomic numbers 19 potassium 21 scandium and 23 vanadium being rarely produced and thus much less common the production of the oddnumbered elements in this range result from much less common thermonuclear reactions as is explained elsewhere
since it is not a very common metal scandium does not have many applications if it were more common it might be useful in the making of aircraft and spacecraft structures probably alloyed with other metals
it is used in lacrosse sticks a light yet strong metal is needed for precise accuracy and speed backcountry tent manufacturers sometimes use scandium alloys in tent poles us gunmaker smith wesson produces a small lightweight revolver with a frame composed of scandium alloy and a titanium cylinder
approximately 20 kg as sc2 o 3 of scandium is used annually in the united states to make highintensity lights scandium iodide added to mercuryvapor lamps produces an efficient artificial light source that resembles sunlight and which allows good colorreproduction with tv cameras about 80 kg of scandium is used in light bulbs globally per year the radioactive isotope sc46 is used in oil refineries as a tracing agent
the main application of scandium by weight is in aluminiumscandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components and for unusual designs sports equipment bikes baseball bats firearms etc which rely on high performance materials however titanium being much more common and similar in lightness and strength is much more widely used with tons found in some aircraft especially military ones
when added to aluminium scandium substantially lowers the rate of recrystallization and associated graingrowth in weld heataffected zones aluminium being a facecentredcubic metal is not particularly subject to the strengthening effects of the decrease in grain diameter however the presence of fine dispersions of al3sc does increase strength by a small measure much as any other precipitate system in aluminium alloys it is added to aluminium alloys primarily to control that otherwise excessive grain growth in the heataffected zone of weldable structural aluminium alloys which gives two knockon effects greater strengthening via finer precipitation of other alloying elements and by reducing the precipitatefree zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of agehardening aluminium alloys
the original use of scandiumaluminium alloys was in the nose cones of some ussr submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms the strength of the resulting nose cone was enough to enable it to pierce the icecap without damage and so enabling a missile launch while still submerged under the arctic ice cap

dmitri mendeleev used his periodic law in 1869 to predict the existence of and some properties of three unknown elements including one he called ekaboron lars fredrick nilson and his team apparently unaware of that prediction in the spring of 1879 were looking for rare earth metals by using spectral analysis they found a new element within the minerals euxenite and gadolinite they named it scandium from the latin scandia meaning scandinavia and in the process of isolating the scandium they processed 10 kilograms of euxenite producing about 20 grams of a very pure scandium oxide sc2o3 per teodor cleve of sweden concluded that scandium corresponded well to the hopedfor ekaboron and he notified mendeleev of this in august fischer brunger and grienelaus prepared metallic scandium for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic melt of potassium lithium and scandium chlorides at a temperature of 700 to 800 c tungsten wires in a pool of liquid zinc were the electrodes in a graphite crucible the first pound of 99 pure scandium metal was not produced until 1960
scandium is distributed sparsely on earth occurring only as trace quantities in many minerals rare minerals from scandinavia and madagascar such as thortveitite euxenite and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element which is never found as a free metal it is also found in residues that remain after tungsten is extracted from wolframite and from ores after uranium and thorium have been extracted
scandium is more common in the sun and certain stars than on earth scandium is only the 50th most common element on earth 35th most abundant in the earths crust but it is the 23rd most common element in the sun the blue color of the aquamarine variety of beryl is thought to be caused by scandium impurities in it
thortveitite and kolbeckite are the primary mineral sources of scandium uranium mill tailings byproducts also are an important source pure scandium is commercially produced by reducing scandium fluoride with metallic calcium
world production of scandium is in the order of 2000 kg per year generally as a byproduct of uranium and nickelcobaltcopper or pge mining consumption is in the order of 5000 kg and typically is consumed in bicycle frames in scal alloys
the present main source of scandium metal to meet this shortfall is from the military stockpiles of the former soviet union mainly in the country of ukraine which were extracted from uranium tailings there is no primary production in the americas europe or australia although gigantic scandium deposits are associated with uranium nickel copper cobalt laterite deposits and associated with ultramafic rocks worldwide
scandium can also be extracted from tantalum residues tungsten processing wastes tin slags and a variety of other such industrial waste streams and it is sometimes recovered from rare earth ores particularly the rare earth oxide deposits of bayan obo china
the strength and commerciality of the scandium market is yet to be demonstrated as it is a specialty metal and a single producer could corner the supply with minimal tonnage production the price in 2006 of 990 scandium oxide is of order of us700 per kilogram
the most common oxidation state of scandium in is 3 scandium chemically resembles yttrium and the rare earth metals more than it resembles aluminium or titanium thus scandium is sometimes seen as the scandium oxide sc2o3 and as scandium chloride sccl3
naturally occurring scandium is composed of 1 stable isotope 45sc 13 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 46sc with a halflife of 838 days 47sc with a halflife of 335 days and 48sc with a halflife of 437 hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than 4 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 2 minutes this element also has 5 meta states with the most stable being 44msc t 586 h
the isotopes of scandium range in atomic weight from 40 u 40sc to 54 u 54sc the primary decay mode at masses lower than the only stable isotope 45sc is electron capture and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission the primary decay products at atomic weights below 45sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes

isolated selenium occurs in several different forms the most stable of which is a dense purplishgray semimetal semiconductor form that is structurally a trigonal polymer chain it conducts electricity better in the light than in the dark and is used in photocells see allotropic section below selenium also exists in many nonconductive forms a black glasslike allotrope as well as several red crystalline forms built of eightmembered ring molecules like its lighter chemical cousin sulfur
selenium is found in economic quantities in sulfide ores such as pyrite partially replacing the sulfur in the ore matrix minerals that are selenide or selenate compounds are also known but all are rare
selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms including selenide selenate and selenite in soils selenium most often occurs in soluble forms like selenate analogous to sulfate which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff
selenium has a biological role and is found in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide selenomethionine and selenocysteine in these compounds selenium plays an analogous role to sulfur
selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores such as those of copper silver or lead it is obtained as a byproduct of the processing of these ores from the anode mud of copper refineries and the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants these muds can be processed by a number of means to obtain free selenium
natural sources of selenium include certain seleniumrich soils and selenium that has been bioconcentrated by certain toxic plants such as locoweed anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores

growth in selenium consumption was historically driven by steady development of new uses including applications in rubber compounding steel alloying and selenium rectifiers by 1970 selenium in rectifiers had largely been replaced by silicon but its use as a photoconductor in plain paper copiers had become its leading application during the 1980s the photoconductor application declined although it was still a large enduse as more and more copiers using organic photoconductors were produced presently the largest use of selenium worldwide is in glass manufacturing followed by uses in chemicals and pigments electronic use despite a number of continued applications continues to decline
in 1996 continuing research showed a positive correlation between selenium supplementation and cancer prevention in humans but widespread direct application of this important finding would not add significantly to demand owing to the small doses required in the late 1990s the use of selenium usually with bismuth as an additive to plumbing brasses to meet nolead environmental standards became important at present total world selenium production continues to increase modestly
although it is toxic in large doses selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals in plants it occurs as a bystander mineral sometimes in toxic proportions in forage some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals but other plants such as locoweed require selenium and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil it is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine in humans selenium is a trace element nutrient which functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants this enzyme occurs in all living organisms but not all forms of it in plants require selenium

selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland by participating as a cofactor for the three known thyroid hormone deiodinases
dietary selenium comes from nuts cereals meat fish and eggs brazil nuts are the richest ordinary dietary source though this is soildependent since the brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs high levels are found in meats found in kidney crab and lobster in that order in the usa the recommended dietary allowance for adults is 55 micrograms per day
although selenium is an essential trace element it is toxic if taken in excess exceeding the tolerable upper intake level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odour on the breath gastrointestinal disorders hair loss sloughing of nails fatigue irritability and neurological damage extreme cases of selenosis can result in cirrhosis of the liver pulmonary edema and death
elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of their low bioavailability by contrast selenate and selenite are very toxic and have modes of action similar to that of arsenic hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic corrosive gas selenium also occurs in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide selenomethionine and selenocysteine all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses
selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normallydry undeveloped lands this process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds such as selenates into the water which may then be concentrated in new wetlands as it evaporates high selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds
selenium deficiency is relatively rare in healthy wellnourished individuals it can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function or those undergoing total parenteral nutrition alternatively people dependent on food grown from seleniumdeficient soil are also at risk in the usa the dietary reference intake for adults is 55 micrograms per day in the uk it is 75 µgday for adult males and 60 µgday for adult females
selenium deficiency can lead to keshan disease which is potentially fatal selenium deficiency also contributes along with iodine deficiency to kashinbeck disease the primary symptom of keshan disease is myocardial necrosis leading to weakening of the heart kashinbeck disease results in atrophy degeneration and necrosis of cartilage tissue keshan disease also makes the body more susceptible to illness caused by other nutritional biochemical or infectious diseases these diseases are most common in certain parts of china where the soil is extremely deficient in selenium studies in jiangsu province of china have indicated a reduction in the prevalence of these diseases by taking selenium supplements
selenium is also necessary for the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine t4 into its more active counterpart triiodothyronine and as such a deficiency can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism including extreme fatigue mental slowing goitre cretinism and recurrent miscarriage
cancer several studies have suggested a link between cancer and selenium deficiency a study conducted on the effect of selenium supplementation on the recurrence of skin cancers did not demonstrate a reduced rate of recurrence of skin cancers but did show a significantly reduced occurrence of total cancers dietary selenium prevents chemically induced carcinogenesis in many rodent studies in these studies organic selenocompounds are more potent and less toxic than selenium salts eg selenocyanates selenomethionine seleniumrich brazil nuts or seleniumenriched garlic or broccoli selenium may help prevent cancer by acting as an antioxidant or by enhancing immune activity not all studies agree on the cancerfighting effects of selenium one study of naturally occurring levels of selenium in over 60000 participants did not show a significant correlation between those levels and cancer the suvimax study concluded that lowdose supplementation with 120 mg of ascorbic acid 30 mg of vitamin e 6 mg of beta carotene 100 µg of selenium and 20 mg of zinc resulted in a 31 reduction in the incidence of cancer and a 37 reduction in all cause mortality in males but did not get a significant result for females the select study is currently investigating the effect of selenium and vitamin e supplementation on incidence of prostate cancer however selenium has been proven to help chemotherapy treatment by enhancing the efficacy of the treatment reducing the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and preventing the bodys resistance to the drugs one of the studies showed that in just 72 hours the efficacy of treatment using chemotherapeutic drugs such as taxol and adriamycin with selenium yeast is significantly higher than the treatment using the drugs alone the finding was shown in various cancer cells breast lung small intestine colon liver
hivaids some research has indicated a geographical link between regions of selenium deficient soils and peak incidences of hiv aids infection for example much of subsaharan africa is low in selenium however senegal is not and also has a significantly lower level of aids infection than the rest of the continent aids appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of hiv or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by aids patients remains debated low selenium levels in aids patients have been directly correlated with decreased immune cell count and increased disease progression and risk of death selenium normally acts as an antioxidant so low levels of it may increase oxidative stress on the immune system leading to more rapid decline of the immune system others have argued that hiv encodes for the human selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase which depletes the victims selenium levels depleted selenium levels in turn lead to a decline in cd4 helper tcells further weakening the immune system regardless of the cause of depleted selenium levels in aids patients studies have shown that selenium deficiency does strongly correlate with the progression of the disease and the risk of death selenium supplementation may help mitigate the symptoms of aids and reduce the risk of mortality it should be emphasized that the evidence to date does not suggest that selenium can reduce the risk of infection or the rate of spread of aids but rather treat the symptoms of those who are already infected
diabetes a wellcontrolled study showed that selenium intake is positively correlated with the risk of developing type ii diabetes because high serum selenium levels are positively associated with the prevalence of diabetes and because selenium deficiency is rare supplementation is not recommended in wellnourished populations such as the us
selenium is a common byproduct of copper refining or the production of sulfuric acid isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements commonly production begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce sodium selenite the sodium selenite is then acidified with sulfuric acid producing selenous acid the selenous acid is finally bubbled with sulfur dioxide producing elemental red amorphous selenium
selenium produced in chemical reactions invariably appears as the amorphous red form an insoluble brick red powder when this form is rapidly melted it forms the black vitreous form which is usually sold industrially as beads the most thermodynamically stable and dense form of selenium is the electrically conductive gray trigonal form which is composed of long helical chains of selenium atoms the conductivity of this form is notably light sensitive selenium also exists in three different deep red crystalline monoclinic forms which are composed of se8 molecules similar to many allotropes of sulfur
chemistry selenium is a catalyst in many chemical reactions and is widely used in various industrial and laboratory syntheses it is also widely used in structure determination of proteins and nucleic acids by xray crystallography incorporation of one or more se atoms helps with mad phasing
manufacturing and materials use the largest use of selenium worldwide is in glass and ceramic manufacturing where it is used to give a red color to glasses enamels and glazes as well as to remove color from glass by counteracting the green tint imparted by ferrous impurities selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead it is also used to improve abrasion resistance in vulcanized rubbers
electronics because of its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties selenium is used in photocopying photocells light meters and solar cells it was once widely used in rectifiers these uses have mostly been replaced by siliconbased devices or are in the process of being replaced the most notable exception is in power dc surge protection where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors sheets of amorphous selenium convert xray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solidstate flat panel xray cameras

the mineral strontianite is named after the scottish village of strontian having been discovered in the lead mines there in 1787 adair crawford recognized it as differing from other barium minerals in 1790 strontium itself was discovered in 1798 by thomas charles hope and metallic strontium was first isolated by sir humphry davy in 1808 using electrolysis
strontium was among the radioactive materials released by the 1957 windscale fire
in 2005 china was the top producer of strontium with almost twothirds world share followed by spain and mexico reports the british geological survey

sixteen unstable isotopes are known to exist of greatest importance is 90sr with a halflife of 2878 years it is a byproduct of nuclear fission which is found in nuclear fallout and presents a health problem since it substitutes for calcium in bone preventing expulsion from the body this isotope is one of the best longlived highenergy beta emitters known and is used in snap systems for nuclear auxiliary power devices these devices hold promise for use in spacecraft remote weather stations navigational buoys etc where a lightweight longlived nuclearelectric power source is required the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated a vast area with 90sr
in its pure form strontium is extremely reactive with air and spontaneously combusts it is therefore considered to be a fire hazard
the human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium due to the elements being sufficiently similar chemically the stable forms of strontium do not pose a significant health threat but the radioactive 90sr can lead to various bone disorders and diseases including bone cancer the strontium unit is used in measuring radioactivity from absorbed 90sr
an innovative drug made by combining strontium with ranelic acid has aided in bone growth boosted bone density and lessened vertebral peripheral and hip fractures women receiving the drug showed a 127 increase in bone density women receiving a placebo had a 16 decrease half the increase in bone density measured by xray densitometry is attributed to the higher atomic weight of sr compared with calcium whereas the other half a true increase in bone mass it means that strontium ranelate creates new and strong bone strontium ranelate marketed under the trade names protelos osseor protos bivalos protaxos ossum is registered for treatment of osteoporosis in many countries all over the world strontium ranelate has been shown to strengthen bones according presentations given the iof world congress on osteoporosis in june of 2006 it also reduced bone resorbtion
strontium ranelate is registered as a prescription drug in europe and many countries worldwide it needs to be prescribed by a doctor delivered by a pharmacist and requires a strict medical supervision currently early 2007 it is not available in canada or the united states
several other salts of strontium such as strontium citrate or strontium carbonate are often presented as natural therapies and sold at a dose that is several hundred times higher than the usual strontium intake despite the lack of strontium deficit referenced in the medical literature and the lack of information about possible toxicity of strontium supplementation such compounds can still be sold in the united states under the dietary supplements health and education act of 1994
however their longterm safety and efficacy have never been evaluated on humans using largescale medical trials such compounds should not be administered to humans before further studies are conducted
allegedly an attempt was made in 1968 to poison alexander dubček with sr90 but it failed
strontium compounds silver is a chemical element with the symbol ag and atomic number 47 a soft white lustrous transition metal it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal it occurs as a free metal native silver as well as in various minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper gold lead and zinc mining
silver has been known since antiquity and it is used as a currency metal it has long been valued as a precious metal used in ornaments and jewellery and in highvalue tableware and utensils hence the term silverware today it is used in photographic film electrical contacts and conductors and mirrors elemental silver is also used to catalyze chemical reactions silver is antimicrobial and dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants although silver has largely been supplanted by other treatments the antiseptic properties of silver are still a useful tool in the prevention and treatment of sepsis and infections caused by antibiotic resistant microorganisms such as mrsa
silver is found in native form combined with sulfur arsenic antimony or chlorine and in various ores such as argentite ag2s horn silver agcl and pyrargyrite ag3sbs3 the principal sources of silver are the ores of copper coppernickel gold lead and leadzinc obtained from peru mexico china and australia peru and mexico have been mining silver since 1546 and are still major world producers
the metal can also be produced during the electrolytic refining of copper and by application of the parkes process on lead metal obtained from lead ores that contain small amounts of silver commercialgrade fine silver is at least 999 pure silver and purities greater than 99999 are available in 2005 peru was the top producer of silver with almost oneseventh world share closely followed by mexico according to the british geological survey
silver is a very ductile and malleable slightly harder than gold monovalent coinage metal with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of polish it has the highest electrical conductivity of all metals even higher than copper but its greater cost and tarnishability have prevented it from being widely used in place of copper for electrical purposes though it was used in the electromagnets used for enriching uranium during world war ii mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper another notable exception is in highend audio cables although the actual benefits of its use in this application are questionable
among metals pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity only the nonmetal diamond s is higher whitest color the highest optical reflectivity although aluminium slightly outdoes it in parts of the visible spectrum and it is a poor reflector of ultraviolet light silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal silver halides are photosensitive and are remarkable for their ability to record a latent image that can later be developed chemically silver is stable in pure air and water but tarnishes when it is exposed to air or water containing ozone or hydrogen sulfide the most common oxidation state of silver is 1 for example silver nitrate agno3 a few 2 for example silverii fluoride agf2 and 3 compounds for example potassium tetrafluoroargentate k agf4 are also known
naturally occurring silver is composed of the two stable isotopes 107ag and 109ag with 107ag being the more abundant 51839 natural abundance silvers standard atomic mass is 10786822 u twentyeight radioisotopes have been characterised the most stable being 105ag with a halflife of 4129 days 111ag with a halflife of 745 days and 112ag with a halflife of 313 hours
all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than an hour and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 3 minutes this element has numerous meta states the most stable being 108mag t 418 years 110mag t 24979 days and 106mag t 828 days
isotopes of silver range in atomic weight from 93943 u 94ag to 123929 u 124ag the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 107ag is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay the primary decay products before 107ag are palladium element 46 isotopes and the primary products after are cadmium element 48 isotopes
the palladium isotope 107pd decays by beta emission to 107ag with a halflife of 65 million years iron meteorites are the only objects with a highenough palladiumtosilver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107ag abundance radiogenic 107ag was first discovered in the santa clara meteorite in 1978 the discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of ironcored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event 107pd107ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of live shortlived nuclides in the early solar system

the malleability and nontoxicity of silver make it useful in amalgams for dental fittings and fillings
photography used 24 of the silver consumed in 2001 in the form of silver nitrate and silver halides while 33 was used in jewellery 40 for industrial uses and only 3 for coins and medals
some electrical and electronic products use silver for its superior conductivity even when tarnished for example printed circuits are made using silver paints and computer keyboards use silver electrical contacts some highend audio hardware dacs preamplifiers etc are fully silverwired which is believed to cause the least loss of quality in the signal silver cadmium oxide is used in high voltage contacts because it can withstand arcing
silver is also used to make solder and brazing alloys electrical contacts and highcapacity silverzinc and silvercadmium batteries silver in a thin layer on top of a bearing material can provide a significant increase in galling resistance and reduce wear under heavy load particularly against steel
mirrors which need superior reflectivity for visible light are made with silver as the reflecting material in a process called silvering though common mirrors are backed with aluminium using a process called sputtering silver and sometimes gold can be applied to glass at various thicknesses allowing different amounts of light to penetrate this is most often seen in architectural glass and tinted windows on vehicles
silvers catalytic properties make it ideal for use as a catalyst in oxidation reactions for example the production of formaldehyde from methanol and air by means of silver screens or crystallites containing a minimum 9995nbspweightpercent silver silver upon some suitable support is probably the only catalyst available today to convert ethylene to ethylene oxide later hydrolyzed to ethylene glycol used for making polyesters a very important industrial reaction
oxygen dissolves in silver relatively easily compared to other gases present in air attempts have been made to construct silver membranes of only a few monolayers thickness such a membrane could be used to filter pure oxygen from air
silver in the form of electrum was coined to produce money in around 700 bc by the lydians later silver was refined and coined in its pure form see silver coin many nations used silver as the basic unit of monetary value see silver standard the words for silver and money are the same in at least 14 languages in the modern world silver bullion has the iso currency code xag
the name of the united kingdom monetary unit pound reflects the fact that it originally represented the value of one troy pound of sterling silver
in the 1800s many nations such as the united states and great britain switched from silver to a gold standard of monetary value then in the 20th century to fiat currency
silver ions and silver compounds show a toxic effect on some bacteria viruses algae and fungi typical for heavy metals like lead or mercury but without the high toxicity to humans that is normally associated with them its germicidal effects kill many microbial organisms in vitro
hippocrates the father of modern medicine wrote that silver had beneficial healing and antidisease properties and the phoenicians used to store water wine and vinegar in silver bottles to prevent spoiling in the early 1900s people would put silver dollars in milk bottles to prolong the milks freshness its germicidal effects increase its value in utensils and as jewellery the exact process of silvers germicidal effect is still not well understood although theories exist one of these is the oligodynamic effect which explains the effect on microbial lifeforms but does not explain certain antiviral effects
silver compounds were used successfully to prevent infection in world war i before the advent of antibiotics silver nitrate solution was a standard of care but was largely replaced by silver sulfadiazine cream ssd cream which was generally the standard of care for the antibacterial and antibiotic treatment of serious burns until the late 1990s now other options such as silvercoated dressings activated silver dressings are used in addition to ssd cream and may present advantages such as pain reduction and capacity for treatment at home
the widespread use of silver went out of fashion with the development of modern antibiotics however recently there has been renewed interest in silver as a broadspectrum antimicrobial in particular it is being used with alginate a naturally occurring biopolymer derived from seaweed in a range of silver alginate products designed to prevent infections as part of wound management procedures particularly applicable to burn victims in 2007 agc flat glass europe introduced the first antibacterial glass to fight hospitalcaught infection it is covered with a thin layer of silver in addition samsung has introduced washing machines with a final rinse containing silver ions to provide several days of antibacterial protection in the clothes kohler has introduced a line of toilet seats that have silver ions embedded to kill germs a company called thomson research associates has begun treating products with ultra fresh an antimicrobial technology involving proprietary nanotechnology to produce the ultrafine silver particles essential to ease of application and longterm protection the fda has recently approved an endotracheal breathing tube with a fine coat of silver for use in mechanical ventilation after studies found it reduced the risk of ventilatorassociated pneumonia
today various kinds of silver compounds or devices to make solutions or colloids containing silver are sold as remedies for a wide variety of diseases although most are harmless some people using these homemade solutions use far too much and develop argyria over a period of months or years and several cases have been documented in the last few years in the medical literature including one possible case of coma associated with a high intake of silver see medical references it is strongly advised to notify a doctor when taking silver as a form of selfmedication
silver is widely used in topical gels and is impregnated into bandages for wounds because of its widespectrum antimicrobial activity medical devices containing silver can be prescribed by a physician
the antimicrobial properties of silver stem from the chemical properties of its ionized form ag this ion forms strong molecular bonds with other substances used by bacteria to respire such as molecules containing sulfur nitrogen and oxygen once the ag ion complexes with these molecules they are rendered unusable by the bacteria depriving it of necessary compounds and eventually leading to the bacterias death
in india foods especially sweets can be found decorated with a thin layer of silver known as vark silver as a food additive is given the e number e174 and is classed as a food coloring it is used solely for external decoration such as on chocolate confectionery in the covering of dragées and the decoration of sugarcoated flour confectionery in australia it is banned as a food additive
silver inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi it keeps odour to a minimum and reduces the risk of bacterial and fungal infection in clothing the combination of silver and moisture movement wicking is the best combination to reduce the harmful effects of prolonged use in active and humid conditions
silver is used in clothing in two main forms a form in which silver ions are integrated into the polymer from which yarns are made a form of nanotechnology a form in which the silver is physically coated onto the yarns in both cases the silver prevents the growth of a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi at the same time silver is a very skinfriendly and highly compatible agent to which unlike many antibiotics bacteria rarely build up resistance
recorded use of silver to prevent infection dates to ancient greece and rome it was rediscovered in the middle ages where it was used for several purposes such as to disinfect water and food during storage and also for the treatment of burns and wounds as wound dressing in the 19th century sailors on long ocean voyages would put silver coins in barrels of water and wine to keep the liquid pure pioneers in america used the same idea as they made their journey from coast to coast silver solutions were approved in the 1920s by the us food and drug administration for use as antibacterial agents today wound dressings containing silver are well established for clinical wound care and have recently been introduced in consumer products such as sticking plasters
the word silver appears in anglosaxon in various spellings such as seolfor and siolfor a similar form is seen throughout the teutonic languages compare old high german silabar and silbir the symbol ag is from the latin for silver argentum compare greek αργυρος argyros from the indoeuropean root arg meaning white or shining
silver has been known since ancient times it is mentioned in the book of genesis and slag heaps found in asia minor and on the islands of the aegean sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium bc
silver is currently about 150th the price of gold by mass and approximately 70 times more valuable than copper silver once traded at 16th to 112th the price of gold prior to the age of discovery and the discovery of great silver deposits in the americas most notably the vast comstock lode in virginia city nevada usa this then resulted in the debate over cheap free silver to benefit the agricultural sector which was among the most prolonged and difficult in that countrys history and dominated public discourse during the latter decades of the nineteenth century
over the last 100 years the price of silver and the goldsilver price ratio have fluctuated greatly due to competing industrial and storeofvalue demands in 1980 the silver price rose to an alltime high of us4945 per troy ounce by december 2001 the price had dropped to us415 per ounce and in may 2006 it had risen back as high as us1521 per ounce as of 2006 silver prices and most other metal prices have been rather volatile for example quickly dropping from the may high of us1521 per ounce to a june low of us960 per ounce before rising back above us1200 per ounce by august
it is of note that in judaic law the price of silver is important the lowest fiscal amount that a jewish court or beth din can convene to adjudicate a case over is a shova pruta value of a babylonian prutra coin this is fixed at 18 of a gram of pure unrefined silver at market price
because of the mysticism surrounding silvers lunar associations as well as the aesthetic qualities of the white reflective metal that cause it to be associated with purity silver in european folklore has long been traditionally believed to be an antidote to various maladies and mythical monsters notably silver was believed to be a repellent against vampires this primarily originates from its holy connotations also mirrors were originally polished silver and as such vampires allegedly cannot be seen in them because they have no soul and it was also believed that a werewolf in his bestial form could only be killed by a weapon or bullet made of silver this has given rise to the term silver bullet which is used to describe things that very effectively deal with one specific problem
in the gospels jesus disciple judas iscariot is infamous for having taken a bribe of silver from religious leaders in jerusalem to turn jesus christ over to the romans
in heraldry the tincture argent in addition to being shown as silver this has been shown at times with real silver in official representations can also be shown as white occasionally the word silver is used rather than argent sometimes this is done acrosstheboard sometimes to avoid repetition of the word argent in blazon
silver plays no known natural biological role in humans and possible health effects of silver are a subject of dispute silver itself is not toxic but most silver salts are and some may be carcinogenic
silver and compounds containing silver like colloidal silver can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues leading to a condition called argyria which results in a bluegrayish pigmentation of the skin eyes and mucous membranes although this condition does not harm a persons health it is disfiguring and usually permanent argyria is rare and mild forms are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis

samarium is a rare earth metal with a bright silver luster that is reasonably stable in air it ignites in air at 150 c even with longterm storage under mineral oil samarium is gradually oxidized with a grayishyellow powder of the oxidehydroxide being formed three crystal modifications of the metal also exist with transformations at 734 and 922 c
uses of samarium include carbonarc lighting for the motion picture industry together with other rare earth metals caf2 crystals for use in optical masers or lasers as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors for alloys and headphones samariumcobalt magnets smco5 and sm2co17 are used in making permanent magnet materials that have high resistance to demagnetization when compared to other permanent magnet materials these materials have high coercivities and intrinsic coercivities samariumcobalt combinations have recently found use in highend magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments samariumii iodide is used as a chemical reagent in organic synthesis for example in the barbier reaction samarium oxide is used in optical glass to absorb infrared light samarium compounds act as sensitizers for phosphors excited in the infrared samarium oxide is a catalyst for the dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol radioactive samarium153 is used in medicine to treat the severe pain associated with cancers that have spread to bone the drug is called quadramet
samarium was first discovered spectroscopically in 1853 by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac by its sharp absorption lines in didymium and isolated in paris in 1879 by french chemist paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran from the mineral samarskite yceufe3nbtati5o16 although samarskite was first found in the urals by the late 1870s a new deposit had been located in north carolina and it was from that source that the samariumbearing didymium had originated
the samarskite mineral was named after vasili samarskybykhovets the chief of staff colonel of the russian corps of mining engineers in 1845ndash1861 the name of the element is derived from the name of the mineral and thus traces back to the name samarskybykhovets in this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a living person
prior to the advent of ionexchange separation technology in the 1950s samarium had no commercial uses in pure form however a byproduct of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of lindsay mix after the company that made it this material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some of the early nuclear reactors nowadays a similar commodity product goes under the name of samarium europium gadolinium concentrate or seg concentrate this is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides extracted from bastnäsite or monazite since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent not all rare earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of seg which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore such producers will therefore be making seg with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors in this manner the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture samarium purification follows the removal of the europium currently being in oversupply samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest
samarium has no known biological role but is said to stimulate the metabolism
samarium is never found free in nature but like other rare earth elements is contained in many minerals including monazite bastnasite and samarskite monazite in which it occurs up to an extent of 28 and bastnäsite are also used as commercial sources misch metal containing about 1 of samarium has long been used but it was not until recent years that relatively pure samarium has been isolated through ion exchange processes solvent extraction techniques and electrochemical deposition the metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samariumiii chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride 1 samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum

sulfur sanskrit sulvari latin sulfur or sulpur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the biblical pentateuch genesis
english translations of the bible commonly referred to sulfur as brimstone giving rise to the name of fire and brimstone sermons in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that awaits the unbelieving and unrepentant it is from this part of the bible that hell is implied to smell of sulfur although as mentioned above sulfur is in fact odorless the smell of sulfur usually refers to either the odor of hydrogen sulfide eg from rotten eggs or of burning sulfur which produces sulfur dioxide the smell associated with burnt matches
sulfur was known in china since the 6th century bc in a natural form that the chinese had called brimstone or shiliuhuang that was found in hanzhong by the 3rd century the chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite
in the late 1770s antoine lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element and not a compound in 1867 sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in louisiana and texas the overlying layer of earth was quicksand prohibiting ordinary mining operations therefore the frasch process was used
the element has traditionally been spelled sulphur in the united kingdom ireland hong kong the commonwealth caribbean and india but sulfur in the united states while both spellings are used in australia new zealand and canada iupac adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990 as did the royal society of chemistry nomenclature committee in 1992 and the qualifications and curriculum authority for england and wales recommended its use in 2000 the spelling of the term in nonofficial texts is gradually becoming uniform as sulfur
in latin the word is variously written sulpur sulphur and sulfur the oxford latin dictionary lists the spellings in this order it is an original latin name and not a classical greek loan so the ph variant does not denote the greek letter φ sulfur in greek is theion θεῖον whence comes the prefix thio the simplification of the latin words p or ph to an f appears to have taken place towards the end of the classical period with the f spelling becoming dominant in the medieval period
sulfur has 18 isotopes four of which are stable 32s 9502 33s 075 34s 421 and 36s 002 other than 35s the radioactive isotopes of sulfur are all short lived 35s is formed from cosmic ray spallation of 40 argon in the atmosphere it has a halflife of 87 days
when sulfide minerals are precipitated isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δs34 values of cogenetic minerals the differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration the δ c 13 and δs34 of coexisting carbonates and sulfides can be used to determine the ph and oxygen fugacity of the orebearing fluid during ore formation
in most forest ecosystems sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere weathering of ore minerals and evaporites also contribute some sulfur sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies differences in the natural abundances can also be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34s of ecosystem components rocky mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different δs34 values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate
sulfur forms more than 30 solid allotropes more than than any other element besides s8 several other rings are known removing one atom from the crown gives s7 which is more deeply yellow than s8 hplc analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly s8 but also s7 and small amounts of s6 larger rings have been prepared including s12 and s18 by contrast sulfurs lighter neighbor oxygen only exists in two states of allotropic significance o2 and o3 selenium the heavier analogue of sulfur can form rings but is more often found as a polymer chain
elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world especially along the pacific ring of fire such volcanic deposits are currently mined in indonesia chile and japan sicily is also famous for its sulfur mines
significant deposits of elemental sulfur also exist in salt domes along the coast of the gulf of mexico and in evaporites in eastern europe and western asia the sulfur in these deposits is believed to come from the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate minerals especially gypsum although apparently native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone without the aid of living organisms see below however fossilbased sulfur deposits from salt domes are the basis for commercial production in the united states poland russia turkmenistan and ukraine
sulfur production through hydrodesulfurization of oil gas and the athabasca oil sands has produced a surplus huge stockpiles of sulfur now exist throughout alberta canada
common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals such as pyrite iron sulfide cinnabar mercury sulfide galena lead sulfide sphalerite zinc sulfide and stibnite antimony sulfide and the sulfates such as gypsum calcium sulfate alunite potassium aluminium sulfate and barite barium sulfate it occurs naturally in volcanic emissions such as from hydrothermal vents and from bacterial action on decaying sulfurcontaining organic matter
the distinctive colors of jupiter s volcanic moon io are from various forms of molten solid and gaseous sulfur there is also a dark area near the lunar crater aristarchus that may be a sulfur deposit
sulfur is present in many types of meteorites ordinary chondrites contain on average 21 sulfur and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 66 sulfur in meteorites is normally present entirely as troilite fes but other sulfides are found in some meteorites and carbonaceous chondrites contain free sulfur sulfates and possibly other sulfur compounds
at room temperature sulfur is a soft bright yellow solid elemental sulfur has only a faint odor similar to that of matches the odor associated with rotten eggs is due to hydrogen sulfide h2s and organic sulfur compounds rather than elemental sulfur sulfur burns with a blue flame that emits sulfur dioxide notable for its peculiar suffocating odor sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as benzene and toluene common oxidation states of sulfur include minus2 2 4 and 6 sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases sulfur in the solid state ordinarily exists as cyclic crownshaped s8 molecules
the crystallography of sulfur is complex depending on the specific conditions the sulfur allotropes form several distinct crystal structures with rhombic and monoclinic s8 best known
a noteworthy property of sulfur is that its viscosity in its molten state unlike most other liquids increases above temperatures of 200 c due to the formation of polymers the molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above this temperature at higher temperatures however the viscosity is decreased as depolymerization occurs
amorphous or plastic sulfur can be produced through the rapid cooling of molten sulfur xray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn this form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts back to crystalline form this process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed
sulfur is extracted by mainly two processes the sicilian process and the frasch process the sicilian process which was first used in sicily was used in ancient times to get sulfur from rocks present in volcanic regions in this process the sulfur deposits are piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides and with airspaces between them then powdered sulfur is put on top of the sulfur deposit and ignited as the sulfur burns the heat melts the sulfur deposits causing the molten sulfur to flow down the sloping hillside the molten sulfur can then be collected in wooden buckets
the second process used to obtain sulfur is the frasch process in this method three concentric pipes are used the outermost pipe contains superheated water which melts the sulfur and the innermost pipe is filled with hot compressed air which serves to create foam and pressure the resulting sulfur foam is then expelled through the middle pipe
the frasch process produces sulfur with a 995 purity content and which needs no further purification the sulfur produced by the sicilian process must be purified by distillation
the claus process is used to extract elemental sulfur from hydrogen sulfide produced in hydrodesulfurization of petroleum or from natural gas
hydrogen sulfide has the characteristic smell of rotten eggs dissolved in water hydrogen sulfide is acidic and will react with metals to form a series of metal sulfides natural metal sulfides are common especially those of iron iron sulfide is called pyrite the socalled fools gold pyrite can show semiconductor properties galena a naturally occurring lead sulfide was the first semiconductor discovered and found a use as a signal rectifier in the cats whiskers of early crystal radios
many of the unpleasant odors of organic matter are based on sulfurcontaining compounds such as methyl and ethyl mercaptan also used to scent natural gas so that leaks are easily detectable the odor of garlic and skunk stink are also caused by sulfurcontaining organic compounds not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant for example grapefruit mercaptan a sulfurcontaining monoterpenoid is responsible for the characteristic scent of grapefruit
polymeric sulfur nitride has metallic properties even though it does not contain any metal atoms this compound also has unusual electrical and optical properties this polymer can be made from tetrasulfur tetranitride s4n4

disulfide bonds ss bonds formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure these strong covalent bonds between peptide chains give proteins a great deal of extra toughness and resiliency for example the high strength of feathers and hair is in part due to their high content of ss bonds and their high content of cysteine and sulfur eggs are high in sulfur because large amounts of the element are necessary for feather formation the high disulfide content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and also their odor when burned
in traditional medical skin treatment which predates modern era of scientific medicine elmental sulfur has been used mainly as part of cremes to alleviate various conditions such as psoriasis eczema acne the mechanism of action is not known although elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid which in turn though the action of sulfite acts as a mild reducing and antibacterial agent
the burning of coal andor petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide s o 2 which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid h2so4 this sulfuric acid is a component of acid rain which lowers the ph of soil and freshwater bodies sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the natural environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures fuel standards increasingly require sulfur to be extracted from fossil fuels to prevent the formation of acid rain this extracted sulfur is then refined and represents a large portion of sulfur production in coal fired power plants the flue gases are sometimes purified in more modern power plants that use syngas the sulfur is extracted before the gas is burned

element 106 was discovered almost simultaneously by two different laboratories in june 1974 an american research team led by albert ghiorso at the lawrence radiation laboratory at the university of california berkeley reported creating an isotope with mass number 263 and a halflife of 10 s and in september 1974 a soviet team led by g n flerov at the joint institute for nuclear research at dubna reported producing an isotope with mass number 259 and a halflife of 048 s
because their work was independently confirmed first the americans suggested the name seaborgium to honor the american chemist glenn t seaborg credited as a member of the american team along with ghiorso j m nitschke j r alonso c t alonso m nurmia e kenneth hulet and r w lougheed in recognition of his participation in the discovery of several other actinides the name selected by the team became controversial an international committee decided in 1992 that the berkeley and dubna laboratories should share credit for the discovery
an element naming controversy erupted and as a result iupac adopted unnilhexium symbol unh as a temporary systematic element name in 1994 a committee of iupac recommended that element 106 be named rutherfordium and adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person this ruling was fiercely objected to by the american chemical society critics pointed out that a precedent had been set in the naming of einsteinium during albert einstein s life in 1997 as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108 the name seaborgium for element 106 was recognized internationally
there are 12 known isotopes of seaborgium the longestlived of which is 271sg which decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission it has a halflife of 24 minutes the shortestlived isotope is 258sg which also decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission it has a halflife of 29 ms

the element occurs within a number of mineral deposits principally rutile and ilmenite which are widely distributed in the earth s crust and lithosphere and it is found in almost all living things rocks water bodies and soils other compounds include titanium tetrachloride ticl4 used in smoke screens skywriting and as a catalyst and titanium trichloride used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene
the two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance and the highest strengthtoweight ratio of any metal in its unalloyed condition titanium is as strong as some steels but 45 lighter and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element 46ti through 50ti with 48ti being the most abundant 738 titaniums properties are chemically and physically similar to zirconium
titanium was discovered combined in a mineral in cornwall england in 1791 by amateur geologist and pastor william gregor the then vicar of creed parish he recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite gregor realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element reported his findings to the royal geological society of cornwall and in the german science journal crells annalen
around the same time franz joseph muller also produced a similar substance but could not identify it klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the titans of greek mythology
the processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly it is not possible to reduce in the normal manner by heating in the presence of carbon because that produces titanium carbide
titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer discovered the iodide or crystal bar process in 1925 by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal
in the 1950s and 1960s the soviet union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications alfa class and mike class as part of programs related to the cold war starting in the early 1950s titanium began to be used extensively for military aviation purposes particularly in highperformance jets starting with aircraft such as the f100 super sabre and lockheed a12
in the usa the department of defense realized the strategic importance of the metal and supported early efforts of commercialization throughout the period of the cold war titanium was considered a strategic material by the us government and a large stockpile of titanium sponge was maintained by the defense national stockpile center which was finally depleted in 2005 today the worlds largest producer russianbased vsmpoavisma is estimated to account for about 29 of the world market share
in 2006 the us defense agency awarded 57nbspmillion to a twocompany consortium to develop a new process for making titanium metal powder under heat and pressure the powder can be used to create strong lightweight items ranging from armor plating to components for the aerospace transportation and chemical processing industries
a metallic element titanium is recognized for its high strengthtoweight ratio lustrous and metallicwhite in color the relatively high melting point over 1649nbspc or 3000nbspf makes it useful as a refractory metal
commercial 992 pure grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63000nbsp psi 434nbsp mpa equal to that of some steel alloys but are 45 lighter however titanium loses strength when heated above 430nbspc 800nbspf
it is fairly hard although not as hard as some grades of heattreated steel and is difficult to machine as it will gall if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used like those made from steel titanium structures have a fatigue limit which guarantees longevity in some applications
the metal is a dimorphic allotrope with the hexagonal alpha form changing into the bodycentered cubic lattice beta form at 882nbspc 1619nbspf
the most noted chemical property of titanium is its excellent resistance to corrosion it is almost as resistant as platinum capable of withstanding attack by acids moist chlorine gas and by common salt solutions
while the following pourbaix diagram shows that titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal it is slow to react with water and air
this metal forms a passive and protective oxide coating leading to increased corrosionresistance when exposed to elevated temperatures in air but at room temperatures it resists tarnishing
titanium burns when heated in air 610nbspc 1130nbspf or higher forming titanium dioxide titanium is resistant to dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acid along with chlorine gas chloride solutions and most organic acids

it is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the minerals anatase brookite ilmenite perovskite rutile titanite sphene as well in many iron ores of these minerals only rutile and ilmenite have any economic importance yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations
titanium is contained in meteorites and has been detected in the sun and in mtype stars
the processing of titanium metal occurs in 4 major steps reduction of titanium ore into sponge a porous form melting of sponge or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot primary fabrication where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet bar plate sheet strip and tube and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products
because the metal reacts with oxygen at high temperatures it cannot be produced by reduction of its dioxide titanium metal is therefore produced commercially by the kroll process a complex and expensive batch process the relatively high market value of titanium is mainly due to its processing which sacrifices another expensive metal magnesium
a more recently developed method the ffc cambridge process may eventually replace the kroll process this method uses titanium dioxide powder which is a refined form of rutile as feedstock to make the end product which is either a powder or sponge if mixed oxide powders are used the product is an alloy manufactured at a much lower cost than the conventional multistep melting process the ffc cambridge process may render titanium a less rare and expensive material for the aerospace industry and the luxury goods market and could be seen in many products currently manufactured using aluminium and specialist grades of steel
common titanium alloys are made by reduction for example cuprotitanium rutile with copper added is reduced ferrocarbon titanium ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace and manganotitanium rutile with manganese or manganese oxides are reduced
about 50 grades of titanium and titanium alloys are designated and currently used although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially the astm international recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys of which grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure unalloyed these four are distinguished by their varying degrees of tensile strength as a function of oxygen content with grade 1 being the most ductile lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 018 and grade 4 the least highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 040
the grades covered by astm and other alloys are also produced to meet aerospace and military specifications saeams milt iso standards and countryspecific specifications as well as proprietary enduser specifications for aerospace military medical and industrial applications
in terms of fabrication all welding of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen or hydrogen the metal can be machined using the same equipment and via the same processes as stainless steel
titanium is used in steel as an alloying element ferrotitanium to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content applications for titanium mill products sheet plate bar wire forgings castings can be found in industrial aerospace recreational and emerging markets powdered titanium is used in pyrotechnics as a source of brightburning particles
about 95 of titanium ore extracted from the earth is destined for refinement into titanium dioxide an intensely white permanent pigment used in paints paper toothpaste and plastics it is also used in cement in gemstones as an optical opacifier in paper and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs
powder is chemically inert resists fading in sunlight and is very opaque this allows it to impart a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or gray chemicals that form the majority of household plastics
recently it has been put to use in air purifiers as a filter coating or in film used to coat windows on buildings which when exposed to uv light either solar or manmade and moisture in the air produces reactive redox species like hydroxyl radicals that can purify the air or keep window surfaces clean

titanium metal is used in automotive applications particularly in automobile or motorcycle racing where weight reduction is critical while maintaining high strength and rigidity the metal is generally too expensive to make it marketable to the general consumer market other than high end products late model corvettes have been available with titanium exhausts and racing bikes are frequently outfitted with titanium mufflers titanium alloy is used for the connecting rods in the engine of the 2006 and later corvette z06 other automotive uses include piston rods and hardware bolts nuts etc
the parker pen company used titanium to form the t1 fountain pen later expanded to t1 ball pens and rollerballs the t1 fountain pen was introduced in 1970 and the t1 rollerball and ball pen in 1971 production was stopped in 1972 due to the high cost of manufacturing titanium parker t1s are prized for their collectibility by collectors
hammer heads made of titanium were introduced in 1999 their light weight allows for a longer handle which increases the velocity of the head and results in more energy being delivered to the nail all while decreasing arm fatigue titanium also decreases the shock transferred to the user because a titanium head generates about 3 recoil compared to a steel head that generates about 27
titanium is used in many sporting goods tennis rackets golf clubs lacrosse stick shafts cricket hockey lacrosse and football helmet grills and bicycle frames and components titanium alloys are also used in spectacle frames this results in a rather expensive but highly durable and long lasting frame which is light in weight and causes no skin allergies many backpackers use titanium equipment including cookware eating utensils lanterns and tent stakes though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives these titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength titanium is also favored for use by farriers since it is lighter and more durable than steel when formed into horseshoes titanium horseshoes can be found in horse racing and are used by many amish horse owners who rely entirely on horsedrawn carriages for transportation titanium has even become somewhat popular for use in jewelry such as rings and body piercings
because of its durability titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry in recent years whereas until recently the metal was too difficult to work into the intricate shapes with the precision necessary for fine jewelry today titanium rings including engagement rings and wedding bands are one of the fastest growing segments of the titanium jewelry market in part due to the ability of the metal to be grooved inlaid and carved without losing strength some titanium jewelry also incorporates diamonds or other gemstones typically in close settings such as bezels flush or tension designs its inertness again makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools
titanium has occasionally been used in architectural applications the 120nbspfoot 40nbspm memorial to yuri gagarin the first man to travel in space in moscow is made of titanium for the metals attractive color and association with rocketry the guggenheim museum bilbao and the cerritos millennium library were the first buildings in europe and north america respectively to be sheathed in titanium panels other construction uses of titanium sheathing include the frederic c hamilton building in denver colorado
due to its superior strength and light weight when compared to other metals traditionally used in firearms steel stainless steel and aluminum and advances in metalworking techniques the use of titanium has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders
because it is biocompatible nontoxic and is not rejected by the body titanium is used in a gamut of medical applications including surgical implements and implants such as hip balls and sockets joint replacement that can stay in place for up to 20 years titanium has the inherent property to osseointegrate enabling use in dental implants that can remain in place for over 30 years this property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications
since titanium is non ferromagnetic patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with magnetic resonance imaging convenient for longterm implants preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a hightemperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized
its inertness and ability to be attractively colored makes it a popular metal for use in body piercing titanium may be anodized to produce various colors a number of artists work with titanium to produce artworks such as sculptures decorative objects and furniture
the 4 oxidation state dominates in titanium chemistry but compounds in the 3 oxidation state are also common because of this high oxidation state many titanium compounds have a high degree of covalent bonding
star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from the titanium dioxide impurities present in them
titanium nitride tin is often used to coat cutting tools such as drill bits it also finds use as a goldcoloured decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication

naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable isotopes 46ti 47ti 48ti 49ti and 50ti with 48ti being the most abundant 738 natural abundance eleven radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 44ti with a halflife of 63 years 45ti with a halflife of 1848 minutes 51ti with a halflife of 576 minutes and 52ti with a halflife of 17 minutes all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 33 seconds and the majority of these have halflives that are less than half a second
the isotopes of titanium range in atomic weight from 3999 u 40ti to 57966 u 58ti the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 48ti is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before 48ti are element 21 scandium isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 vanadium isotopes
titanium is nontoxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the human body an estimated 08 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day but most passes through without being absorbed it does however have a tendency to bioaccumulate in tissues that contain silica an unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth this may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million ppm of titanium food plants have about 2 ppm and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm
as a powder or in the form of metal shavings titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and when heated in air an explosion hazard water and carbon dioxide based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium class d dry powder fire fighting agents must be used instead
even bulk titanium metal is susceptible to fire when it is heated to its melting point a number of titanium fires occur during breaking down devices containing titanium parts with cutting torches
when used in the production or handling of chlorine care must be taken to use titanium only in locations where it will not be exposed to dry chlorine gas which can result in a titaniumchlorine fire care must be taken even when titanium is used in wet chlorine due to possible unexpected drying brought about by extreme weather conditions
titanium can catch fire when a fresh nonoxidized surface gets in contact with liquid oxygen such surfaces can appear when the oxidized surface is struck with a hard object or when a mechanical strain causes the emergence of a crack this poses the possible limitation for its use in liquid oxygen systems such as those found in the aerospace industry
salts of titanium are often considered to be relatively harmless but its chlorine compounds such as ticlsub2sub ticlsub3sub and ticlsub4sub have presented several unusual hazards the dichloride takes the form of pyrophoric black crystals and the tetrachloride is a volatile fuming liquid all of titaniums chlorides are corrosive

before the element was discovered many of the properties of element 43 were predicted by dmitri mendeleev mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and called the element ekamanganese in 1937 its isotope 97tc became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced hence its name from the greek τεχνητός meaning artificial most technetium produced on earth is a byproduct of fission of uranium235 in nuclear reactors and is extracted from nuclear fuel rods no isotope of technetium has a halflife longer than 42 million years 98tc so its detection in red giants in 1952 helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements on earth technetium occurs in trace but measurable quantities as a product of spontaneous fission in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores
technetium is a silverygrey radioactive metal with an appearance similar to platinum however it is commonly obtained as a grey powder its position in the periodic table is between rhenium and manganese and as predicted by the periodic law its properties are intermediate between those two elements technetium is unusual among the lighter elements in that it has no stable isotopes only technetium and promethium have no stable isotopes but are followed by elements which do
technetium is therefore extremely rare on earth technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body
the metal form of technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air its oxides are tc o 2 and tc2o7 under oxidizing conditions technetium vii will exist as the pertechnetate ion tco4 common oxidation states of technetium include 0 2 4 5 6 and 7 technetium will burn in oxygen when in powder form it dissolves in aqua regia nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid it has characteristic spectral lines at 363 nm 403 nm 410 nm 426 nm 430 nm and 485 nm
the metal form is slightly paramagnetic meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields even though technetium is not normally magnetic the crystal structure of the metal is hexagonal closepacked pure metallic singlecrystal technetium becomes a type ii superconductor at 746 k irregular crystals and trace impurities raise this temperature to 112 k for 999 pure technetium powder below this temperature technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth the largest among the elements apart from niobium
technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission and spreads more readily than many radionuclides in spite of the importance of understanding its toxicity in animals and humans experimental evidence is scant it appears to have low chemical toxicity its radiological toxicity per unit of mass is a function of compound type of radiation for the isotope in question and the isotope halflife technetium99m is particularly attractive for medical applications as the radiation from this isotope is a gamma ray with the same wavelength as xrays used for common medical diagnostic xray applications giving it adequate penetration while causing minimal damage for a gamma photon this plus the extremely short halflife of this metastable nuclear isomer followed by the relatively long halflife of the daughter isotope tc99 which allows it to be eliminated from the body before it decays this leads to a relatively low dose of administered radiation in biologically doseequivalent amounts sieverts for a typical tc99m based nuclear scan see more on this subject below
all isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully the most common isotope technetium99 is a weak beta emitter such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware soft xrays are emitted when the beta particles are stopped but as long as the body is kept more than 30 cm away these should pose no problem the primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk for most work careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient a glove box is not needed
99mtc m indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer is used in radioactive isotope medical tests for example as a radioactive tracer that medical equipment can detect in the body it is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140 kev gamma rays and its halflife is 601 hours meaning that about fifteen sixteenths of it decays to 99tc in 24 hours klaus schwochaus book technetium lists 31 radiopharmaceuticals based on 99mtc for imaging and functional studies of the brain myocardium thyroid lungs liver gallbladder kidneys skeleton blood and tumors
immunoscintigraphy incorporates 99mtc into a monoclonal antibody an immune system protein capable of binding to cancer cells a few hours after injection medical equipment is used to detect the gamma rays emitted by the 99mtc higher concentrations indicate where the tumor is this technique is particularly useful for detecting hardtofind cancers such as those affecting the intestine these modified antibodies are sold by the german company hoechst now part of sanofiaventis under the name scintium
when 99mtc is combined with a tin compound it binds to red blood cells and can therefore be used to map circulatory system disorders it is commonly used to detect gastrointestinal bleeding sites a pyrophosphate ion with 99mtc adheres to calcium deposits in damaged heart muscle making it useful to gauge damage after a heart attack the sulfur colloid of 99mtc is scavenged by the spleen making it possible to image the structure of the spleen
radiation exposure due to diagnostic treatment involving tc99m can be kept low because 99mtc has a short halflife and high energy gamma allowing small amounts to be easily detected its quick decay into the farless radioactive 99tc results in relatively less total radiation dose to the patient per unit of initial activity after administration in the form administered in these medical tests usually pertechnetate both isotopes are quickly eliminated from the body generally within a few days
technetium for nuclear medicine purposes is usually extracted from technetium99m generators 95mtc with a halflife of 61 days is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems
technetium99 decays almost entirely by beta decay emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays moreover its long halflife means that this emission decreases very slowly with time it can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste for these reasons it is a nist standard beta emitter used for equipment calibration
technetium99 has also been proposed for use in optoelectric and nanoscale nuclear batteries
like rhenium and palladium technetium can serve as a catalyst for certain reactions for example the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium of course its radioactivity is a major problem in finding safe applications
under certain circumstances a small concentration 5105 mol l of the pertechnetate ion in water can protect iron and carbon steels from corrosion for this reason pertechnetate could find use as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel although technetiums radioactivity poses problems for strictly chemical uses such as these while for example cro42 can also inhibit corrosion it requires a concentration ten times as high in one experiment a test specimen was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20 years and was still uncorroded the mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not wellunderstood but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer one theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water activated carbon can also be used for the same effect the effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added
as noted the radioactive nature of technetium 3 m bq per liter at the concentrations required makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations nevertheless corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed but never adopted for use in boiling water reactors
for a number of years there was a gap in the periodic table between molybdenum element 42 and ruthenium element 44 many early researchers were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements it was first thought to have been found in platinum ores in 1828 it was given the name polinium but it turned out to be impure iridium then in 1846 the element ilmenium was claimed to have been discovered but was determined to be impure niobium this mistake was repeated in 1847 with the discovery of pelopium dmitri mendeleev predicted that this missing element as part of other predictions would be chemically similar to manganese and gave it the name ekamanganese
in 1877 the russian chemist serge kern reported discovering the missing element in platinum ore kern named what he thought was the new element davyum after the noted english chemist sir humphry davy but it was determined to be a mixture of iridium rhodium and iron another candidate lucium followed in 1896 but it was determined to be yttrium then in 1908 the japanese chemist masataka ogawa found evidence in the mineral thorianite which he thought indicated the presence of element 43 ogawa named the element nipponium after japan which is nippon in japanese in 2004 h k yoshihara utilized a record of xray spectrum of ogawas nipponium sample from thorianite which was contained in a photographic plate preserved by his family the spectrum was read and indicated the absence of the element 43 and the presence of the element 75 rhenium
german chemists walter noddack otto berg and ida tacke later mrs noddack reported the discovery of element 75 and element 43 in 1925 and named element 43 masurium after masuria in eastern prussia now in poland the region where walter noddacks family originated
in 1998 john t armstrong of the national institute of standards and technology ran computer simulations of the 1925 experiments and obtained results quite close to those reported by the noddack team he claimed that this was further supported by work published by david curtis of the los alamos national laboratory measuring the tiny natural occurrence of technetium however the noddacks experimental results have never been reproduced and they were unable to isolate any element 43 debate still exists as to whether the 1925 team actually did discover element 43
discovery of element 43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the university of palermo in sicily conducted by carlo perrier and emilio segrè in the summer of 1936 segrè and his wife visited the united states first new york at columbia university where he had spent time the previous summer and then berkeley at ernest o lawrence s radiation laboratory he persuaded cyclotron inventor lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive in early 1937 lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron segrè enlisted his experienced chemist colleague perrier to attempt to prove through comparative chemistry that the molybdenum activity was indeed z 43 an element not existent in nature because of its instability against nuclear decay with considerable difficulty they finally succeeded in isolating three distinct decay periods 90 80 and 50 days that eventually turned out to be two isotopes 95tc and 97tc of technetium the name given later by perrier and segrè to the first manmade element university of palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery panormium after the latin name for palermo panormus the researchers instead named element 43 after the greek word τεχνητός meaning artificial since it was the first element to be artificially produced
in 1952 astronomer paul w merrill in california detected the spectral signature of technetium in particular light at 4031 nm 4238 nm 4268 nm and 4297 nm in light from stype red giants more recently such observations provided evidence that elements were being formed by neutron capture in the sprocess
since its discovery there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources in 1962 technetium99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the belgian congo in extremely small quantities about 02 ngkg there is also evidence that the oklo natural nuclear fission reactor produced significant amounts of technetium99 which has since decayed to ruthenium99
since technetium is unstable only minute traces occur naturally in the earth s crust as a spontaneous fission product of uranium in 1999 david curtis see above estimated that a kilogram of uranium contains 1 nanogram 1109 g of technetium extraterrestrial technetium was found in some red giant stars s m and ntypes that contain an absorption line in their spectrum indicating the presence of this element
in contrast with the rare natural occurrence bulk quantities of technetium99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods which contain various fission products the fission of a gram of uranium235 in nuclear reactors yields 27 mg of 99tc giving technetium a fission product yield of 61 other fissile isotopes also produce similar yields of technetium
it is estimated that up to 1994 about 49000 t bq 78 metric tons of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium however only a fraction of the production is used commercially as of 2005 technetium99 is available to holders of an ornl permit for us 83g plus packing charges
since the yield of technetium99 as a product of the nuclear fission of both uranium 235 and plutonium 239 is moderate it is present in radioactive waste of fission reactors and is produced when a fission bomb is detonated the amount of artificially produced technetium in the environment exceeds its natural occurrence to a large extent this is due to release by atmospheric nuclear testing along with the disposal and processing of highlevel radioactive waste due to its high fission yield and relatively high halflife technetium99 is one of the main components of nuclear waste its decay measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel is dominant at about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste
an estimated 160 t bq about 250 kg of technetium99 was released into the environment up to 1994 by atmospheric nuclear tests
as a result of nuclear fuel reprocessing technetium has been discharged into the sea in a number of locations and some seafood contains tiny but measurable quantities for example lobster from west cumbria contains small amounts of technetium the anaerobic spore forming bacteria in the clostridium genus are able to reduce tcvii to tciv clostridia bacteria play a role in reducing iron manganese and uranium thereby affecting these elements solubility in soil and sediments their ability to reduce technetium may determine a large part of tcs mobility in industrial wastes and other subsurface environments
the long halflife of technetium99 and its ability to form an anionic species makes it along with sup129supi a major concern when considering longterm disposal of highlevel radioactive waste in addition many of the processes designed to remove fission products from mediumactive process streams in reprocessing plants are designed to remove cationic species like caesium eg sup137supcs and strontium eg sup90supsr hence the pertechnetate is able to escape through these treatment processes current disposal options favor burial in geologically stable rock the primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment the anionic pertechnetate and iodide are less able to absorb onto the surfaces of minerals so they are likely to be more mobile
by comparison plutonium uranium and caesium are much more able to bind to soil particles for this reason the environmental chemistry of technetium is an active area of research an alternative disposal method transmutation has been demonstrated at cern for technetium99 this transmutation process is one in which the technetium 99tc as a metal target is bombarded with neutrons to form the shortlived 100tc half life 16 seconds which decays by beta decay to ruthenium 100ru if recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal an extremely pure technetium target is needed if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present in the target they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target the formation of 106ru half life 374 days from the fresh fission is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used
the actual production of technetium99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process during fuel reprocessing it appears in the waste liquid which is highly radioactive after sitting for several years the radioactivity has fallen to a point where extraction of the longlived isotopes including technetium99 becomes feasible several chemical extraction processes are used yielding technetium99 metal of high purity
the meta stable a state where the nucleus is in an excited state isotope 99mtc is produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing all 99mo and 99mtc will have decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinides in conventional nuclear reprocessing the purex raffinate will contain a high concentration of technetium as tco4 but almost all of this will be 99tc the vast majority of the 99mtc used in medical work is formed from 99mo which is formed by the neutron activation of 98mo 99mo has a halflife of 67 hours so shortlived 99mtc halflife 6 hours which results from its decay is being constantly produced the hospital then chemically extracts the technetium from the solution by using a technetium99m generator technetium cow also occasionally called a molybdenum cow
the normal technetium cow is an alumina column which contains molybdenum98 inasmuch as aluminium has a small neutron cross section it is convenient for an alumina column bearing inactive 98mo to be irradiated with neutrons to make the radioactive mo99 column for the technetium cow by working in this way there is no need for the complex chemical steps which would be required to separate molybdenum from a fission product mixture this alternative method requires that an enriched uranium target be irradiated with neutrons to form 99mo as a fission product then separated
other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission when needed they are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes for example 97tc can be made by neutron irradiation of 96ru
technetium is one of the two elements in the first 82 that have no stable isotopes in fact it is the lowestnumbered element that is exclusively radioactive the other such element is promethium the most stable radioisotopes are 98tc halflife of 42 ma 97tc halflife 26 ma and 99tc halflife 2111 ka
twentytwo other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic masses ranging from 87933 u 88tc to 112931 u 113tc most of these have halflives that are less than an hour the exceptions are 93tc halflife 275 hours 94tc halflife 4883 hours 95tc halflife 20 hours and 96tc halflife 428 days
technetium also has numerous meta states 97mtc is the most stable with a halflife of 901 days 0097 mev this is followed by 95mtc half life 61 days 0038 mev and 99mtc halflife 601 hours 0143 mev 99mtc only emits gamma rays subsequently decaying to 99tc
for isotopes lighter than the most stable isotope 98tc the primary decay mode is electron capture giving molybdenum for the heavier isotopes the primary mode is beta emission giving ruthenium with the exception that 100tc can decay both by beta emission and electron capture
technetium99 is the most common and most readily available isotope as it is a major product of the fission of uranium235 one gram of 99tc produces 62108 disintegrations a second that is 062 g bq g
technetium and promethium are unusual light elements in that they have no stable isotopes the reason for this is somewhat complicated
using the liquid drop model for atomic nuclei one can derive a semiempirical formula for the binding energy of a nucleus this formula predicts a valley of beta stability along which nuclides do not undergo beta decay nuclides that lie up the walls of the valley tend to decay by beta decay towards the center by emitting an electron emitting a positron or capturing an electron
for a fixed odd number of nucleons a the graph of binding energies vs atomic number number of protons is shaped like a parabola ushaped with the most stable nuclide at the bottom a single beta decay or electron captures then transforms one nuclide of mass a into the next or preceding one if the product has a lower binding energy and the difference in energy is sufficient to drive the decay mode when there is only one parabola there can be only one stable isotope lying on that parabola for a fixed even number of nucleons a the graph is jagged and is better visualized as two separate parabolas for even and odd atomic numbers because isotopes with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons are more stable than isotopes with an odd number of neutrons and an odd number of protons
when there are two parabolas that is when the number of nucleons is even it can happen rarely that there is a stable nucleus with an odd number of neutrons and an odd number of protons although there are only 4 truly stable examples as opposed to very longlived the light nuclei 2h 6li 10b 14n however if this happens there can be no stable isotope with an even number of neutrons and an even number of protons
for technetium z43 the valley of beta stability is centered at around 98 nucleons however for every number of nucleons from 95 to 102 there is already at least one stable nuclide of either molybdenum z42 or ruthenium z44 for the isotopes with odd numbers of nucleons this immediately rules out a stable isotope of technetium since there can be only one stable nuclide with a fixed odd number of nucleons for the isotopes with an even number of nucleons since technetium has an odd number of protons any isotope must also have an odd number of neutrons in such a case the presence of a stable nuclide having the same number of nucleons and an even number of protons rules out the possibility of a stable nucleus

tin is a malleable ductile highly crystalline silverywhite metal when a bar of tin is bent a strange crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard due to the breaking of the crystals this metal resists corrosion from distilled sea and soft tap water but can be attacked by strong acids alkalis and by acid salts tin acts as a catalyst when oxygen is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack tin forms the dioxide sno2 when it is heated in the presence of air sno2 in turn is feebly acidic and forms stannate sno32 salts with basic oxides tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals in order to prevent corrosion or other chemical action this metal combines directly with chlorine and oxygen and displaces hydrogen from dilute acids tin is malleable at ordinary temperatures but is brittle when it is heated
tins chemical properties fall between those of metals and nonmetals just as the semiconductors silicon and germanium do tin has two allotropes at normal pressure and temperature gray tin and white tin below 132 c it exists as gray or alpha tin which has a cubic crystal structure similar to silicon and germanium gray tin has no metallic properties at all is a dullgray powdery material and has few uses other than a few specialized semiconductor applications when warmed above 132 c tin changes into white or beta tin which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure converting gray tin powder into white tin produces white tin powder to convert powdery gray tin into solid white tin the temperature must be raised above the melting point of tin gray tin can cause undesirable effects in applications where the metallic properties of tin are important since metallic white tin will slowly convert to gray tin if it is held for a long time below 132 c the metallic surface of white tin becomes covered with a gray powder which is easily rubbed off the gray patches slowly expand until all of the tin in the object is converted from the metal to the powder at which point it loses its structural integrity and may fall to pieces this process is known as tin disease or tin pest tin pest was a particular problem in northern europe in the 18th century as organ pipes made of tin would sometimes completely disintegrate during long cold winters some sources also say that during napoleon s russian campaign of 1812 the temperatures became so cold that the tin buttons on the soldiers uniforms disintegrated contributing to the defeat of the grande armée however the veracity of this story is debatable because napoleon would likely have foreseen this problem and the transformation to gray tin often takes a reasonably long time this transformation however may be prevented by the addition of antimony or bismuth
tin bonds readily to iron and has been used for coating lead or zinc and steel to prevent corrosion tinplated steel containers are widely used for food preservation and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin speakers of british english call them tins americans call them cans or tin cans one thusderived use of the slang term tinnie or tinny means can of beer the tin whistle is so called because it was first massproduced in tinplated steel
other uses some important tin alloys are bronze bell metal babbitt metal die casting alloy pewter phosphor bronze soft solder and white metal the most important salt formed is stannous chloride which has found use as a reducing agent and as a mordant in the calico printing process electrically conductive coatings are produced when tin salts are sprayed onto glass these coatings have been used in panel lighting and in the production of frostfree windshields most metal pipes in a pipe organ are made of varying amounts of a tinlead alloy with 5050 being the most common the amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipes tone since tin is the most tonally resonant of all metals when a tinlead alloy cools the lead cools slightly faster and makes a mottled or spotted effect this metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal window glass is most often made via floating molten glass on top of molten tin creating float glass in order to make a flat surface this is called the pilkington process tin is also used in solders for joining pipes or electric circuits in bearing alloys in glassmaking and in a wide range of tin chemical applications although of higher melting point than a lead tin alloy the use of pure tin or tin alloyed with other metals in these applications is rapidly supplanting the use of the previously common leadndashcontaining alloys in order to eliminate the problems of toxicity caused by lead tin foil was once a common wrapping material for foods and drugs replaced in the early 20th century by the use of aluminium foil which is now commonly referred to as tin foil hence one use of the slang term tinnie or tinny for a small retail package of a drug such as cannabis or for a can of beer
tin becomes a superconductor below 372 k in fact tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied the meissner effect one of the characteristic features of superconductors was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals the niobium tin compound nbsub3subsn is commercially used as wires for superconducting magnets due to the materials high critical temperature 18 k and critical magnetic field 25 t a superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of kilograms is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional electromagnet weighing tons
tin old english tin old latin plumbum candidum white lead old german tsin late latin stannum is one of the earliest metals known and was used as a component of bronze from antiquity because of its hardening effect on copper tin was used in bronze implements as early as 3500 bc tin mining is believed to have started in cornwall and devon esp dartmoor in classical times and a thriving tin trade developed with the civilizations of the mediterranean however the lone metal was not used until about 600 bc the last cornish tin mine at south crofty near camborne closed in 1998 bringing 4000 years of mining in cornwall to an end but as of 2007 increased demand from china may lead to its reopening
the word tin has cognates in many germanic and celtic languages the american heritage dictionary speculates that the word was borrowed from a preindoeuropean language the later name stannum and its romance derivatures come from the leadsilver alloy of the same name for the finding of the latter in ores the former stagnum was the word for a stale pool or puddle
in modern times the word tin is often improperly used as a generic phrase for any silvery metal that comes in sheets most everyday materials that are commonly called tin such as aluminum foil beverage cans corrugated building sheathing and tin cans are actually made of steel or aluminum although tin cans tinned cans do contain a thin coating of tin to inhibit rust likewise socalled tin toys are usually made of steel and may or may not have a coating of tin to inhibit rust
in 2005 china was the largest producer of tin with at least onethird of the worlds share closely followed by indonesia and south america reports the british geological survey
tin is produced by reducing the ore with coal in a reverberatory furnace this metal is a relatively scarce element with an abundance in the earth s crust of about 2 ppm compared with 94 ppm for zinc 63 ppm for copper and 12 ppm for lead most of the worlds tin is produced from placer deposits the only mineral of commercial importance as a source of tin is cassiterite sn o 2 although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite cylindrite franckeite canfieldite and teallite secondary or scrap tin is also an important source of the metal tasmania hosts some deposits of historical importance most notably mount bischoff and renison bell
it is esimtated that at current consumption rates the earth will run out of tin in 40 years however lester brown has suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2 growth per year

tellurium latin tellus meaning earth was discovered in 1782 by the hungarian franzjoseph müller von reichenstein müller ferenc in nagyszeben now sibiu transylvania in 1789 another hungarian scientist pál kitaibel also discovered the element independently but later he gave the credit to müller in 1798 it was named by martin heinrich klaproth who earlier isolated it
tellurium was used as a chemical bonder in the making of the outer shell of the first atom bomb the 1960s brought growth in thermoelectric applications for tellurium as well as its use in freemachining steel which became the dominant use
with an abundance in the earths crust even lower than platinum tellurium is apart from the precious metals the rarest stable solid element in the earths crust its abundance by mass is less than 0001 ppm compare with 0037 ppm for platinum by comparison even the rarest of the lanthanides have crustal abundances of 05 ppm
the extreme rarity of tellurium in the earths crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance which is in fact greater than that of rubidium even though rubidium is ten thousand times more abundant in the earths crust rather the extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on earth results from the fact that during the formation of the earth the stable form of elements in the absence of oxygen and water was controlled by the oxidation and reduction of hydrogen under this scenario elements such as tellurium which form volatile hydrides were severely depleted during the formation of the earths crust through evaporation tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the earths crust by this process
tellurium is sometimes found in its native elemental form but is more often found as the tellurides of gold calaverite krennerite petzite sylvanite and others tellurium compounds are the only chemical compounds of gold found in nature but tellurium itself unlike gold is also found combined with other elements in metallic salts the principal source of tellurium is from anode sludges produced during the electrolytic refining of blister copper it is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead treatment of 500 tons of copper ore typically yields one pound of tellurium tellurium is produced mainly in the us canada peru and japan see here

thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils where it is about three times more abundant than uranium and is about as common as lead soil commonly contains an average of around 12 parts per million ppm of thorium thorium occurs in several minerals the most common being the rare earththoriumphosphate mineral monazite which contains up to about 12 thorium oxide there are substantial deposits in several countries 232th decays very slowly its halflife is about three times the age of the earth but other thorium isotopes occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains most of these are shortlived and hence much more radioactive than 232th though on a mass basis they are negligible india is believed to have 25 of the worlds thorium reserves
see also thorium minerals present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively lowkey exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand under the prevailing estimate australia and india have particularly large reserves of thorium
the prevailing estimate of the economically available thorium reserves comes from the us geological survey mineral commodity summaries 19972006

thorium as well as uranium and plutonium can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor although not fissile itself 232th will absorb slow neutrons to produce uranium233 233u which is fissile hence like 238u it is fertile in one significant respect 233u is better than the other two fissile isotopes used for nuclear fuel 235u and plutonium239 239pu because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed given a start with some other fissile material 235u or 239pu a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that currently possible with the 238uto239pu cycle in slowneutron reactors can be set up the 232th absorbs a neutron to become 233th which normally emits an electron and an antineutrino by betasupminussup decay to become protactinium 233 233pa and then emits another electron and antineutrino by a second betaminus decay to become 233u

the irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor the 233u separated from the thorium a relatively simple process since it involves chemical instead of isotopic separation and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle
problems include the high cost of fuel fabrication due partly to the high radioactivity of 233u which is a result of its contamination with traces of the shortlived 232u the similar problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive 228th some weapons proliferation risk of 233u and the technical problems not yet satisfactorily solved in reprocessing much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialised and the effort required seems unlikely while or where abundant uranium is available
nevertheless the thorium fuel cycle with its potential for breeding fuel without fast neutron reactors holds considerable potential longterm benefits thorium is significantly more abundant than uranium and is a key factor in sustainable nuclear energy an example of this is the liquid fluoride reactor
one of the earliest efforts to use thorium fuel cycle took place at oak ridge national laboratory in the 1960s an experimental reactor was built based on molten salt reactor technology to study the feasibility of such an approach this effort culminated in a molten salt breeder reactor msbr design that used 232th as the fertile material and 233u as the fissile fuel due to a lack of funding the msbr program was discontinued in 1976 india having about 25 of the worlds reserves
in 2007 norway was debating whether or not to focus on thorium plants due to the existence of large deposits of thorium ores in the country particularly at fensfeltet near ulefoss in telemark county

naturally occurring thorium is composed of one isotope sup232supth twentyseven radioisotopes have been characterized with the most abundant andor stable being 232th with a halflife of 1405 billion years 230th with a halflife of 75380 years 229th with a halflife of 7340 years and 228th with a halflife of 192 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have halflives that are less than ten minutes one isotope 229th has a nuclear isomer or metastable state with a remarkably low excitation energy of 35 ev
the known isotopes of thorium range in atomic weight from 210 u 210th to 236 u 236th
powdered thorium metal is often pyrophoric and should be handled carefully
natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin owning and handling small amounts of thorium such as a gas mantle is considered safe if care is taken not to ingest the thorium lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation exposure to aerosolized thorium can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung pancreas and blood exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases this element has no known biological role see also thorotrast
thorium has been extracted chiefly from monazite through a multistage process in the first stage the monazite sand is dissolved in an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid h2so4 in the second the thorium is extracted into an organic phase containing an amine next it is separated or stripped using an anion such as nitrate chloride hydroxide or carbonate returning the thorium to an aqueous phase finally the thorium is precipitated and collected

terbium is a silverywhite rare earth metal that is malleable ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife it is reasonably stable in air and two crystal allotropes exist with a transformation temperature of 1289 c terbiumiii cation is brilliantly fluorescent in a beautiful bright lemonyellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamyyellow fluorescence in part to terbium
terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate materials that are used in solidstate devices and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures together with zrosub2sub
terbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices as a component of terfenold an alloy that expands or contracts to a high degree in the presence of a magnetic field terbium is of use in actuators sensors and other magenetomechanical devices
terbium oxide is used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps and color tv tubes sodium terbium borate is used in solid state devices the brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior terbium green phosphors which fluoresce a brilliant lemonyellow are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the trichromatic lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the worlds terbium supply trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting
terbium was discovered in 1843 by swedish chemist carl gustaf mosander who detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide y2o3 and named after the village ytterby in sweden it was not isolated in pure form until the recent advent of ion exchange techniques when mosander first partitioned yttria into three fractions terbia was the fraction that contained the pink color due to what is now known as erbium and erbia was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution but gave a browntinged oxide later workers had difficulty in observing the latter but the pink fraction was impossible to miss arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed in the confusion the original names got reversed and the exchange of names stuck it is now thought that those workers who used the double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium content of the system into the ceriacontaining precipitate in any case what is now known as terbium was only about 1 of the original yttria but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the oxide thus terbium was a minor component in the original terbium fraction dominated by its immediate neighbors gadolinium and dysprosium thereafter whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name until at last it was pure the 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of fluorescence technology wherewith to observe the brilliant fluorescence that would have made this element much easier to track in mixtures
terbium is classified as a rare earth element the term rare is misleading because terbium is more common than metals such as silver and mercury the name rare earth meant something else to early chemists it was used because the rare earth elements were very difficult to separate from each other they were not rare in the earth but they were rarely used for anything also it was initially believed that they were rare but actually it was later discovered that it wasnt the case
terbium is never found in nature as a free element but it is contained in many minerals including cerite gadolinite monazite celathndypo4 which contains up to 003 of terbium xenotime ypo4 and euxenite ycaerlaceuthnbtati2o6 which contains 1 or more of terbium the richest current commercial sources of terbium are the ionadsorption clays of southern china the highyttrium concentrate versions of these are about twothirds yttrium oxide by weight and about 1 terbia however small amounts occur in bastnaesite and monazite and when these are processed by solventextraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides in the form of samarium europium gadolinium concentrate seg concentrate the terbium content of the ore ends up therein due to the large volumes of bastnaesite processed relative to the richer ionadsorption clays a significant proportion of the worlds terbium supply comes from bastnaesite

tungsten also called wolfram is a chemical element that has the symbol w german wolfram and atomic number 74 a very hard heavy steelgray to white transition metal tungsten is found in several ores including wolframite and scheelite and is remarkable for its robust physical properties especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon the pure form is used mainly in electrical applications but its many compounds and alloys are widely used in many applications most notably in light bulb filaments in xray tubes as both the filament and target and in superalloys tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules
naturally occurring tungsten consists of five isotopes whose halflives are so long that they can be considered stable all can decay into isotopes of element 72 hafnium by alpha emission 180w has been observed to have a half life of 18 02 ea the other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay constraining their halflives to be 182w t12 83 ea 184w t12 29 ea 185w t12 13 ea 186w t12 27 ea on average two alpha decays of 180w occur in one gram of natural tungsten per year
27 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized the most stable of which are 181w with a halflife of 1212nbspdays 185w with a halflife of 751nbspdays 188w with a halflife of 694nbspdays and 178w with a halflife of 216nbspdays all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives of less than 24nbsphours and most of these have halflives that are less than 8nbspminutes tungsten also has 4nbsp meta states the most stable being 179mw t 64 minutes
pure tungsten is steelgray to tinwhite and is a hard metal tungsten can be cut with a hacksaw when it is very pure it is brittle and hard to work when impure and is otherwise worked by forging drawing extruding or sintering of all metals at temperatures above 1650nbspc 3000nbspf this element has the highest melting point 3422nbsp c 6192nbsp f lowest vapor pressure and the highest tensile strength tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal its corrosion resistance is excellent and it can be attacked only slightly by most mineral acids tungsten metal forms a protective oxide when exposed to air but can be oxidized at high temperature steel alloyed with small quantities of tungsten greatly increases its toughness
the most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is 6 but it exhibits all oxidation states from 1 to 6 tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide wo3 which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions wo42minus
aqueous tungstate solutions are noted for the formation of polyoxoanions under neutral and acidic conditions as tungstate is progressively treated with acid it first yields the soluble metastable paratungstate a anion w7o246minus which over hours or days converts to the less soluble paratungstate b anion h2w12o4210minus further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion h2w12o406minus after equilibrium is reached the metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten oxygen octahedra known as the keggin anion many other polyoxoanions exist as metastable species the inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids such as phosphotungstic acid h3p w12o40 in this example

tungsten is a metal with a wide range of uses the largest of which is as tungsten carbide w2 c wc in cemented carbides cemented carbides also called hardmetals are wearresistant materials used by the metalworking mining petroleum and construction industries tungsten is widely used in light bulb and vacuum tube filaments as well as electrodes because it can be drawn into very thin wire with a high melting point other uses its high melting point makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high temperature uses which include electrical heating and welding applications notably in the gtaw process also called tig welding hardness and density properties make this metal ideal for making heavy metal alloys that are used in armament heat sinks and high density applications such as weights counterweights ballast keels for yachts and tail ballast for commercial aircraft the high density makes it an ideal ingredient for darts normally 80 and sometimes up to 97 this allows darts containing tungsten to have a smaller diameter than those of other metals at the same weight permitting tighter groupings high speed steel contains tungsten and some tungsten steels contain as much as 18 tungsten superalloys containing tungsten are used in turbine blades and wear resistant parts and coatings examples are hastelloy and stellite tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets shot and radiation shields tungsten chemical compounds are used in catalysts inorganic pigments and tungsten disulfide hightemperature lubricants which are stable to 500nbspc 930nbspf since this elements thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass it is used for making glasstometal seals it is used in kinetic energy penetrators usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys used as an alternative to depleted uranium tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits contact holes are etched in silicon dioxide dielectric material filled with tungsten and polished to form connections to transistors typical contact holes can be as small as 65 nm tungsten carbide is one of the hardest carbides and is used in machine tools such as make milling and turning tools and used together with cobalt and carbon is often the best choice for such applications used extensively for shielding in the radiopharmaceutical industry it is often employed when transporting individual fdg doses called pigs the high energy of fluorine18 makes lead much less effective tungsten is used in the emitters of focused ion beam and electron microscopes tungsten is also beginning to be used in jewelry its hardness makes it ideal for rings that will never scratch are hypoallergenic and will not need polishing this property is especially useful in designs with a brushed finish also used in fishing lures like the mormyshka tungsten is used as ballast in high level race cars in series such as nascar and formula 1
miscellaneous oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine the metal is also used in xray targets and heating elements for electrical furnaces salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries tungsten bronzes socalled due to the colour of the tungsten oxides along with other compounds are used in paints some types of strings for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wire
tungsten is found in the minerals wolframite iron manganese tungstate few o 4mnwo4 scheelite calcium tungstate cawo4 ferberite and hübnerite there are major deposits of these minerals in china with about 57 world share russia austria and portugal reports the british geological survey the metal is commercially produced by reducing tungsten oxide with hydrogen or carbon
world tungsten reserves have been estimated at 7 million t w many of these reserves are not economically viable at this time at current rates of consumption these reserves will last for approximately 140 years it is estimated that 30 of the reserves are wolframite and 70 are scheelite ores another factor that controls the tungsten supply is scrap recycling of tungsten which is more readily refined for reuse than raw ore
tungsten swedish tung sten meaning heavy stone even though the current name for the element in swedish is wolfram sometimes spelled in swedish as volfram from the denomination volf rahm by wallerius in 1747 translated from the description by agricola in 1546 as lupi spuma meaning wolfs froth after the way tin is eaten up like a wolf after sheep in the process of its extraction
it was first hypothesized to exist by peter woulfe in 1779 who examined wolframite and concluded that it must contain a new substance in 1781 carl wilhelm scheele ascertained that a new acid could be made from tungstenite scheele and torbern bergman suggested that it could be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing tungstic acid in 1783 josé and fausto elhuyar found an acid in wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid in spain later that year the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten through reduction of this acid with charcoal they are credited with the discovery of the element
in world war ii tungsten played an enormous role in background political dealings portugal as the main european source of the element was put under pressure from both sides because of its sources of wolframite ore the resistance to high temperatures as well as the extreme strength of its alloys made the metal into a very important raw material for the weaponry industry

thulium has been used to create laser light but high production costs have prevented other commercial uses from being developed other applications real and potential when stable thulium tm169 is bombarded in a nuclear reactor it can later serve as a radiation source in portable xray devices the unstable isotope tm171 could possibly be used as an energy source tm169 has potential use in ceramic magnetic materials called ferrites which are used in microwave equipment
thulium was discovered by swedish chemist per teodor cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements this was the same method carl gustaf mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia er 2 o 3 and upon additional processing obtained two new substances one brown and one green the brown substance turned out to be the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by cleve and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after thule scandinavia
thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color they had to be content with observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands as erbium was progressively removed the first researcher to obtain thulium nearly pure was the british expatriate working on a large scale at new hampshire college in durham nh charles james in 1911 he reported his results having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification he famously needed 15000 operations to establish that the material was homogeneous
the element is never found in nature in pure form but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths it is principally extracted from monazite 0007 thulium ores found in river sands through ionexchange newer ionexchange and solvent extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production the principal source today are the ion adsorption clays of southern china in the versions of these where about twothirds of the total rare earth content is yttrium thulium is about 05 or about tied with lutetium for rarity the metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container none of thuliums compounds are commercially important
naturally occurring thulium is composed of 1 stable isotope tm169 100 natural abundance 31 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being tm171 with a halflife of 192 years tm170 with a halflife of 1286 days tm168 with a halflife of 931 days and tm167 with a halflife of 925 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflifes that are less than 64 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 2 minutes this element also has 14 meta states with the most stable being tm164m t 51 minutes tm160m t 745 seconds and tm155m t 45 seconds
the isotopes of thulium range in atomic weight from 145966 u tm146 to 176949 u tm177 the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope tm169 is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before tm169 are element 68 erbium isotopes and the primary products after are element 70 ytterbium isotopes

ytterby thulium compounds webelementscom ndash thulium also used as a reference tantalum formerly tantalium is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 a rare hard bluegray lustrous transition metal tantalum is highly corrosionresistant and occurs naturally in the mineral tantalite
tantalum is dark dense ductile very hard easily fabricated and highly conductive of heat and electricity the metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids in fact at temperatures below 150nbsp c tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia it can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide tantalums high melting point of 3017nbspc boiling point 5458nbspc is exceeded only by tungsten and rhenium for metals and carbon
the major use for tantalum as the metal powder is in the production of electronic components mainly capacitors and some highend audiograde resistors tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer using tantalum powder pressed into a pellet shape as one plate of the capacitor the oxide as the dielectric and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other plate because the dielectric layer can be very thin thinner than the similar layer in for instance an aluminium electrolytic capacitor a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume because of the size and weight advantages tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones pagerspersonal computers and automotive electronics
tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points are strong and have good ductility alloyed with other metals it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components chemical process equipment nuclear reactors and missile parts because of its ductility tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium
due to the fact that it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants for example porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalums ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue the oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses the metal is also used to make vacuum furnace parts
shaped charge liners have been constructed from tantalum
tantalum was discovered in sweden in 1802 by anders ekeberg and isolated in 1820 by jöns berzelius many contemporary chemists believed niobium and tantalum were the same elements until 1844 and later 1866 when researchers showed that niobic and tantalic acids were different compounds early investigators were only able to isolate impure metal and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by werner von bolton in 1903 wires made with tantalum metal were used for light bulbs until tungsten replaced it
its name is derived from the character tantalus father of niobe in greek mythology who was punished after death by being condemned to stand kneedeep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head both of which eternally tantalized him if he bent to drink the water it drained below the level he could reach and if he reached for the fruit the branches moved out of his grasp this was considered similar to tantalums general nonreactivitymdashit sits among reagents and is unaffected by them the english word tantalize was named after tantalus and tantalum was named after the tantalizing problems posed by the inertness of the element and its compounds
for many years the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate that had been discovered by marignac in the 1860s the method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoridecontaining solutions

tantalite is largely found mixed with columbite in an ore called coltan ethical questions have been raised about human rights and endangered wildlife due to the exploitation of resources in the conflict regions of the congo see coltan
several complicated steps are involved in the separation of tantalum from niobium commercially viable production of this element can follow one of several different methods which includes electrolysis of molten potassium fluorotantalate reduction of potassium fluorotantalate with sodium or by reacting tantalum carbide with tantalum oxide tantalum is also a byproduct from tin smelting

combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic thallium has been used in the production of high density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 c these glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices thallium amalgam is used in thermometers for low temperature because it freezes at 58 c pure mercury freezes at 38 c
in addition research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop hightemperature superconducting materials for such applications as magnetic resonance imaging storage of magnetic energy magnetic propulsion and electric power generation and transmission
thallium greek θαλλός thallos meaning a green shoot or twig was discovered by sir william crookes in 1861 in england while he was making spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on residues from a sulfuric acid plant the name comes from thalliums bright green spectral emission lines in 1862 crookes and claudeauguste lamy isolated the metal independently of each other
although the metal is reasonably abundant in the earth s crust at a concentration estimated to be about 07 mgkg mostly in association with potassium minerals in clays soils and granites it is not generally considered to be commercially recoverable from those forms the major source of commercial thallium is the trace amounts found in copper lead zinc and other sulfide ores
thallium is found in the minerals crookesite tlcu7se4 hutchinsonite tlpbas5s9 and lorandite tlass2 it also occurs as trace in pyrites and extracted as a byproduct of roasting this ore for sulfuric acid production the metal can be obtained from the smelting of lead and zinc rich ores manganese nodules found on the ocean floor also contain thallium but nodule extraction is prohibitively expensive and potentially environmentally destructive in addition several other thallium minerals containing 16 to 60 thallium occur in nature as sulfide or selenide complexes with antimony arsenic copper lead and silver but are rare and have no commercial importance as sources of this element see also categorythallium minerals
thallium has 25 isotopes which have atomic masses that range from 184 to 210 203tl and 205tl are the only stable isotopes and 204tl is the most stable radioisotope with a halflife of 378 years
thallium202 half life 1223 days can be made in a cyclotron while thallium204 half life 378 years is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor
thallium and its compounds are very toxic and should be handled with great care contact with skin is dangerous and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal thalliumi compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin exposure to them should not exceed 01 mg per m of skin in an 8hour timeweighted average 40hour work week thallium is a suspected human carcinogen
part of the reason for thalliums high toxicity is that when present in aqueous solution as the univalent thalliumi ion tl it exhibits some similarities with essential alkali metal cations particularly potassium as the atomic radius is almost identical it can thus enter the body via potassium uptake pathways however other aspects of thalliums chemistry are very different from that of the alkali metals eg its high affinity for sulfur ligands due to the presence of empty dorbitals and so this substitution disrupts many cellular processes for instance thallium may attack sulphurcontaining proteins such as cysteine residues and ferredoxins
thalliums toxicity has led to its use now discontinued in many countries as a rat and ant poison
among the distinctive effects of thallium poisoning are loss of hair which led it to its initial use as a depilatory before its toxicity was properly appreciated and damage to peripheral nerves victims may experience a sensation of walking on hot coals thallium was once an effective murder weapon before its effects became understood and an antidote prussian blue discovered
one of the main methods of removing thallium both radioactive and normal from humans is to use prussian blue which is a solid ion exchange material which absorbs thallium and releases potassium the prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool
the cia is believed by its inspector general to have conceived a scheme to poison fidel castro by exposure to thallium salts placed in his shoes while they were being polished the goal was to discredit him by causing him to lose his characteristic hair and beard the scheme progressed as far as testing on animals but the trip during which the poison was to be administered fell through
in 1953 australian caroline grills was sentenced to life in prison after three family members and a close family friend died authorities found thallium in tea that she had given to two additional family members
it is claimed that south african agents once plotted to use it against nelson mandela while he was in prison on robben island the truth and reconciliation commission heard how agents established plans to add doses of the chemical to his medication
thallium is one of the poisons that graham frederick young used on his victims
in 1988 members of the carr family from central florida fell ill from what appeared to be thallium poisoning peggy carr the mother died slowly and painfully from the poison and her son and stepson were critically ill but recovered peggys husband was initially a suspect until thallium was discovered in his system two years later the carrs neighbor george j trepal a chemist and member of mensa was convicted of murdering mrs carr and attempting to murder her family the thallium was found to be slipped into bottles of cocacola at mrs carrs house and trepal was sentenced to die in the electric chair
in june 2004 25 russian soldiers earned honorable mention darwin awards after becoming ill from thallium exposure when they found a can of mysterious white powder in a rubbish dump on their base at khabarovsk in the russian far east oblivious to the danger of misusing an unidentified white powder from a military dump site the conscripts added it to tobacco and used it as a substitute for talcum powder on their feet
in 2005 a 17 year old girl in numazu shizuoka japan admitted to attempting to murder her mother by lacing her tea with thallium causing a national scandal

in nature uranium atoms exist as uranium238 99284 uranium235 0711 and a very small amount of uranium234 00058 uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle the halflife of uranium238 is about 447 billion years and that of uranium235 is 704 million years making them useful in dating the age of the earth see uraniumthorium dating uraniumlead dating and uraniumuranium dating along with thorium and plutonium uranium is one of the three fissile elements meaning it can easily break apart to become lighter elements while uranium238 has a small probability to fission spontaneously or when bombarded with fast neutrons the much higher probability of uranium235 and to a lesser degree uranium233 to fission when bombarded with slow neutrons generates the heat in nuclear reactors used as a source of power and provides the fissile material for nuclear weapons both uses rely on the ability of uranium to produce a sustained nuclear chain reaction depleted uranium uranium238 is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating
uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing orangered to lemon yellow hues it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography the 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth who named the new element after the planet uranus eugènemelchior péligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were uncovered in 1896 by antoine becquerel research by enrico fermi and others starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in little boy the first nuclear weapon used in war an ensuing arms race during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used enriched uranium and uraniumderived plutonium the security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 along with the legacy of nuclear testing and nuclear accidents is a concern for public health and safety
when refined uranium is a silvery white weakly radioactive metal which is slightly softer than steel strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor
uranium metal reacts with nearly all nonmetallic elements and their compounds with reactivity increasing with temperature hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium but nonoxidizing acids attack the element very slowly
uranium was the first element that was found to be fissile upon bombardment with slow neutrons its uranium235 isotope becomes a very shortlived uranium236 isotope which immediately divides into two smaller nuclei releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons if these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium235 nuclei a nuclear chain reaction occurs and if there is nothing to absorb some neutrons and slow the reaction the reaction is explosive as little as 15nbsplb 7nbspkg of uranium235 can be used to make an atomic bomb the first atomic bomb worked by this principle nuclear fission
the major application of uranium in the military sector is in highdensity penetrators this ammunition consists of depleted uranium du alloyed with 12 other elements at high impact speed the density hardness and flammability of the projectile enable destruction of heavily armored targets tank armor and the removable armor on combat vehicles are also hardened with depleted uranium du plates the use of du became a contentious politicalenvironmental issue after the use of du munitions by the us uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions of uranium compounds left in the soil see gulf war syndrome
depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials counter to popular belief the main risk of exposure to du is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak alpha emitter
during the later stages of world war ii the entire cold war and to a much lesser extent afterwards uranium was used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses uranium235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses uranium238 derived plutonium239 later a much more complicated and far more powerful fusion bomb that uses a plutoniumbased device in a uranium casing to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion was built
the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel commercial nuclear power plants by the time it is completely fissioned one kilogram of uranium can theoretically produce about 20nbsp trillion joules of energy 20 nbspjoules as much electricity as 1500 tonnes of coal
commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3 uranium235
prior to the discovery of radiation uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery dyes such as uranium glass and in fiestaware uranium was also used in photographic chemicals esp uranium nitrate as a toner
the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element the long halflife of the isotope uranium238 451 years makes it wellsuited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating including uraniumthorium dating and uraniumlead dating uranium metal is used for xray targets in the making of highenergy xrays
the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes yellow glass with 1 uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples italy by r t gunther of the university of oxford in 1912 starting in the late middle ages pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal bohemia now jáchymov in the czech republic and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry
the discovery of the element is credited to the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth while he was working in his experimental laboratory in berlin in 1789 klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely sodium diuranate by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide klaproth mistakenly assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yetundiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself in fact that powder was an oxide of uranium he named the newly discovered element after the planet uranus which had been discovered eight years earlier by william herschel
in 1841 eugènemelchior péligot who was professor of analytical chemistry at the conservatoire national des arts et métiers central school of arts and manufactures in paris isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium
antoine henri becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896
a team led by enrico fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays electrons or positrons see beta particle the experiments leading to the discovery of uraniums ability to fission break apart into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann in hahns laboratory in berlin lise meitner and her nephew physicist otto robert frisch published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process nuclear fission soon after fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 and later work found that on average about 2 12 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium235
on 2 december 1942 another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial nuclear chain reaction chicago pile1 working in a lab below the stands of stagg field at the university of chicago the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400nbsptons 360nbsptonnes of graphite 58nbsptons 53nbsptonnes of uranium oxide and six tons five and a half tonnes of uranium metal
two major types of atomic bomb were developed in the manhattan project during world war ii a plutonium based device see trinity test and fat man whose plutonium was derived from uranium238 and a uraniumbased device nicknamed little boy whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium the uraniumbased little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945 exploding with a yield equivalent to 12500nbsptonnes of tnt the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50000 buildings and killed approximately 75000 people see atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki
experimental breeder reactor i at the idaho national laboratoryinl near arco idaho became the first functioning artificial nuclear reactor on 20 december 1951 initially four 150watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility later the whole town of arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power the worlds first commercial scale nuclear power station obninsk in the soviet union began generation with its reactor am1 on 27 june 1954 other early nuclear power plants were calder hall in england which began generation on 17 october 1956 and the shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania which began on 26 may 1958 nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine the uss nautilus in 1954
fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors were found in three separate ore deposits at the oklo mine in gabon west africa in 1972 discovered by french physicist francis perrin they are collectively known as the oklo fossil reactors the ore they exist in is 17 billion years old at that time uranium235 constituted about three percent of the total uranium on earth this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur providing other conditions are right the ability of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products in less than ideal conditions has been cited by the us federal government as evidence of their claim that the yucca mountain facility could safely be a repository of waste for the nuclear power industry
during the cold war between the soviet union and the united states huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium
since the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 an estimated 600nbsptons 540nbsptonnes of highlyenriched weapons grade uranium enough to make 40000 nuclear warheads have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the russian federation and several other former soviet states
aboveground nuclear tests by the soviet union and the united states in the 1950s and early 1960s and by france into the 1970s and 1980s additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents
the windscale fire at the sellafield nuclear plant in 1957 spread iodine131 a short lived radioactive isotope over much of northern england
the three mile island accident in 1979 released a small amount of iodine131 the amounts released by the partial meltdown of the three mile island power plant were minimal and an environmental survey only found trace amounts in a few field mice dwelling nearby as i131 has a half life of slightly more than eight days any danger posed by the radioactive material has long since passed for both of these incidents
the chernobyl disaster in 1986 however was a complete core breach meltdown and partial detonation of the reactor which ejected iodine131 and strontium90 over a large area of europe the 28 year halflife of strontium90 means that only recently has some of the surrounding countryside around the reactor been deemed safe enough to be habitable
uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water uranium is also the highestnumbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is always found combined with other elements the decay of uranium thorium and potassium40 in the earths mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection which in turn drives plate tectonics
its average concentration in the earth s crust is depending on the reference 2 to 4 parts per million
it is more plentiful than antimony tin cadmium mercury or silver and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum
some organisms such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times higher than in their environment citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria will encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uraniumpolluted water
plants absorb some uranium from the soil they are rooted in dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million
uranium ore is mined in several ways by open pit underground insitu leaching and borehole mining see uranium mining highgrade ores found in athabasca basin deposits in saskatchewan canada can contain up to 70 uranium oxides and therefore must be diluted with waste rock prior to milling uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali the leachate is then subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange the resulting mixture called yellowcake contains at least 75 uranium oxides yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process prior to refining and conversion
commercialgrade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals
it is estimated that 47 million tonnes of uranium ore reserves are economically viable while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction
exploration for uranium is continuing to increase with us200 million being spent world wide in 2005 a 54 increase on the previous year
australia has 40 of the worlds uranium ore reserves and the worlds largest single uranium deposit located at the olympic dam mine in south australia almost all of the uranium production is exported under strict international atomic energy agency safeguards against use in nuclear weapons
the largest single source of uranium ore in the united states was the colorado plateau located in colorado utah new mexico and arizona the us federal government paid discovery bonuses and guaranteed purchase prices to anyone who found and delivered uranium ore and was the sole legal purchaser of the uranium the economic incentives resulted in a frenzy of exploration and mining activity throughout the colorado plateau from 1947 through 1959 that left thousands of miles of crudely graded roads spiderwebbing the remote deserts of the colorado plateau and thousands of abandoned uranium mines exploratory shafts and tailings piles the frenzy ended as suddenly as it had begun when the us government stopped purchasing the uranium
in 2005 seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides with canada 279 of world production and australia 228 being the largest producers and kazakhstan 105 russia 80 namibia 75 niger 74 uzbekistan 55 the united states 25 ukraine 19 and china 17 also producing significant amounts the ultimate supply of uranium is believed to be very large and sufficient for at least the next 85 years although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century it is estimated that for a ten times increase in price the supply of uranium that can be economically mined is increased 300 times
calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than particles that have long retention times or are recovered in the stack scrubber while uranium content is referred to for content to do so is inaccurate and dates to the days of the manhattan project when was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard
phase relationships in the uraniumoxygen system are highly complex the most important oxidation states of uranium are uraniumiv and uraniumvi and their two corresponding oxides are respectively uranium dioxide and uranium trioxide other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide uo diuranium pentoxide and uranium peroxide are also known to exist
the most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octaoxide and the aforementioned both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions triuranium octaoxide is depending on conditions the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel
ions that represent the four different oxidation states of uranium are soluble and therefore can be studied in aqueous solutions they are u3 red u4 green unstable and chemuo2sup2sup yellow a few solid and semimetallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uraniumii but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state ions of u3 liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable the ion represents the uraniumvi state and is known to form compounds such as the carbonate chloride and sulfate also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents the most commonlyencountered of which is uranyl acetate
the interactions of carbonate anions with uraniumvi cause the pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution it is interesting to note that while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water uranium carbonates are often soluble in water this is due to the fact that a uvi cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes
the fraction digrams explain this further it can be seen that when the ph of a uraniumvi solution is increased that the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and then at high phs to an anionic hydroxide complex
on addition of carbonate to the system the uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes when the ph is increased one important overall effect of these reactions is to increase the solubility of the uranium in the range ph 6 to 8 this is important when considering the long term stability of used uranium dioxide nuclear fuels
uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 c 482 to 572 f reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide nitride and halide compounds two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250 c
uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids react with water and can ignite in air to form uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride un uranium dinitride and diuranium trinitride
all uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide
at room temperatures has a high vapor pressure making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate highly valuable uranium235 from the far more common uranium238 isotope this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process
one method of preparing uranium tetrachloride is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride the reduction of by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine
bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of respectively bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding to those elements acids
naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major isotopes uranium238 9928 natural abundance uranium235 071 and uranium234 00054 all three isotopes are radioactive creating radioisotopes with the most abundant and stable being uranium238 with a halflife of 451 years close to the age of the earth uranium235 with a halflife of 713 years and uranium234 with a halflife of 248 years
uranium238 is an α emitter decaying through the 18member uranium natural decay series into lead206
the isotope uranium235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons because it is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile that is can be broken apart by thermal neutrons
enrichment of uranium ore through isotope separation to concentrate the fissionable uranium235 is needed for use in nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants with the exception of pressurised heavy water reactors a majority of neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium235 must impact other uranium235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction needed for these applications the concentration and amount of uranium235 needed to achieve this is called a critical mass
to be considered enriched the uranium235 fraction has to be increased to significantly greater than its concentration in naturallyoccurring uranium enriched uranium typically has a uranium235 concentration of between 3 and 5 the process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium238 called depleted uranium or du to be considered depleted the uranium235 isotope concentration has to have been decreased to significantly less than its natural concentration typically the amount of uranium235 left in depleted uranium is 02 to 03 as the price of uranium has risen since 2001 some enrichment tailings containing more than 035 uranium235 are being considered for reenrichment driving the price of these depleted uranium hexafluoride stores above 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from just 5 in 2001
the gas centrifuge process where gaseous uranium hexafluoride is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using highspeed centrifuges has become the cheapest and leading enrichment process lighter concentrates in the center of the centrifuge the gaseous diffusion process was the previous leading method for enrichment and the one used in the manhattan project in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver zinc membrane and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate uranium 238 is heavier and thus diffuses slightly slower than uranium235
a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as radon by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food the amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used or live or work near a coal fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or manmade slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas
almost all uranium that is ingested is excreted during digestion but up to 5 is absorbed by the body when the soluble uranyl ion is ingested while only 05 is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested
the greatest health risk from large intakes of uranium is toxic damage to the kidneys because in addition to being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal radiological effects are generally local because this is the nature of alpha radiation the primary form from u238 decay no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium but exposure to some of its decay products especially radon does pose a significant health threat although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities those deaths were not associated with uranium itself finelydivided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric so small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature

vanadium is a soft and ductile silvergrey metal it has good resistance to corrosion by alkalis sulfuric and hydrochloric acid it oxidizes readily at about 933 k 660 c vanadium has good structural strength and a low fission neutron cross section making it useful in nuclear applications although a metal it shares with chromium and manganese the property of having valency oxides with acid properties
common oxidation states of vanadium include 2 3 4 and 5 a popular experiment with ammonium vanadate nh4vo3 reducing the compound with zinc metal can demonstrate colorimetrically all four of these vanadium oxidation states a 1 oxidation state is rarely seen
approximately 80 of vanadium produced is used as ferrovanadium or as a steel additive other uses in such alloys as specialty stainless steel eg for use in surgical instruments and tools rust resistant and high speed tool steels mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys used in jet engines and highspeed airframes vanadium steel alloys are used in axles crankshafts gears and other critical components it is an important carbide stabilizer in making steels because of its low fission neutron cross section vanadium has nuclear applications vanadium foil is used in cladding titanium to steel vanadiumgallium tape is used in superconducting magnets 175000 gauss vanadium pentoxide v2o5 is used as a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid via the contact process and maleic anhydride it is also used in making ceramics glass coated with vanadium dioxide vo2 can block infrared radiation and not visible light at a specific temperature electrical fuel cells and storage batteries such as vanadium redox batteries added to corundum to make simulated alexandrite jewelry vanadate electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting steel against rust and corrosion used to make lacrosse shafts possibly used to make wootz steel and damascus steel
vanadium was originally discovered by andrés manuel del río a spanishborn mexican mineralogist in mexico city in 1801 he called it brown lead now named vanadinite through experimentation its colors reminded him of chromium so he named the element panchromium he later renamed this compound erythronium since most of the salts turned red when heated the french chemist hippolyte victor colletdescotils incorrectly declared that del ríos new element was only impure chromium del río thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the french chemist that was also backed by del ríos friend baron alexander von humboldt
in 1831 sefström of sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some iron ores and later that same year friedrich wöhler confirmed del ríos earlier work later george william featherstonhaugh one of the first us geologists suggested that the element should be named rionium after del río but this never happened
metallic vanadium was isolated by henry enfield roscoe in 1867 who reduced vanadiumiii chloride vcl3 with hydrogen the name vanadium comes from vanadis a goddess in scandinavian mythology because the element has beautiful multicolored chemical compounds
in biology a vanadium atom is an essential component of some enzymes particularly the vanadium nitrogenase used by some nitrogenfixing microorganisms vanadium is essential to ascidians or sea squirts in vanadium chromagen proteins the concentration of vanadium in their blood is more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them rats and chickens are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired reproduction
ten percent of the blood cell pigment of the sea cucumber is vanadium just as the horseshoe crab has blue blood rather than red blood colored by iron in hemoglobin because of copper in the hemocyanin pigment the blood of the sea cucumber is yellow because of the vanadium in the vanabin pigment nonetheless there is no evidence that vanabins carry oxygen in contrast to hemoglobin and hemocyanin a form of vanadium vanadyl sulfate seems to improve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes
most continental waters show a vanadium concentration of less than 3 ppb however the groundwater of mt fuji contains a very high concentration of vanadiumup to 150 ppb this vanadium is solubilized from the basalt by the groundwater the vanadium content in mt fuji becomes higher at places nearer the summit and deeper in the ground recently this highvanadium water of mt fuji has been sold by many companies as an agent to cope with diabetes however there is no concrete evidence for its efficacy the rainbow trout living in the mt fuji water showed much higher accumulation of vanadium in kidneys and bone
vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different minerals among which are patronite vs4 vanadinite pb5vo43cl and carnotite k2uo22vo423h2o vanadium is also present in bauxite and in carbon containing deposits such as crude oil coal oil shale and tar sands vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the sun and some other stars
much of the vanadium metal being produced is now made by calcium reduction of vsub2subosub5sub in a pressure vessel vanadium is usually recovered as a byproduct or coproduct and so world resources of the element are not really indicative of available supply
see also categoryvanadate minerals vanadium is available commercially and production of a sample in the laboratory is not normally required commercially routes leading to metallic vanadium as main product are not usually required as enough is produced as byproduct in other processes
in industry heating of vanadium ore or residues from other processes with salt nacl or sodium carbonate na2co3 at about 850c gives sodium vanadate navo3 this is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide v2o5 reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium an alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride vcl5 with hydrogen or magnesium many other methods are also in use
industrially most vanadium is used as an additive to improve steels rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide v2o5 with crude iron this produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work
vanadium pentoxide v2o5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid it is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium it can be used as a dye and colorfixer
vanadyl sulfate voso4 also called vanadiumiv sulfate oxide hydrate is used as a relatively controversial dietary supplement primarily for increasing insulin sensitivity and bodybuilding whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a placebo effect
vanadiumiv chloride vcl4 is a soluble form of vanadium that is commonly used in the laboratory viv is the reduced form of vv and commonly occurs after anaerobic respiration by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria vcl4 reacts violently with water
the toxicity of vanadium depends on its physicochemical state particularly on its valence state and solubility tetravalent voso4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent v2o3 roschin 1967 vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system sax 1984 atsdr 1990 ress et al 2003 worleknirsch et al 2007 quantitative data are however insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose other effects have been reported on blood parameters after oral or inhalation exposures scibior et al 2006 gonzalezvillalva et al 2006 on liver kobayashi et al 2006 neurological development in rats soaso and garcia 2007 and other organs

it is known that vanadium gets the oxidation states 2 3 4 5 to observe the colours of these states ammonium metavanadate nh4vo3 can be used as a starting agent it must be acidified beforehand so dioxovanadiumv ion vo2 yellow 5 oxidation number is produced in alkaline medium the stable form of vanadiumv state is vo3
adding zinc powder and concentrated hydrochloric acid continuously vo2 is reduced into blue vo2
it can be seen that during the reaction the mixture is green in colour as the original yellow of the 5 state and the blue of the 4 are present
continuously adding zn powder and concentrated hcl blue vo2 is reduced to green v3 v3 is then reduced to violet v2 by zn powder and concentrated hcl again

naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable isotope 51v and one radioactive isotope 50v with a halflife of 151017 years 24 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized in the range of mass number between 40 and 65 with the most stable being 49v with a halflife of 330 days and 48v with a halflife of 159735 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives shorter than an hour the majority of them below 10 seconds in 4 isotopes metastable excited states were found including 2 metastable states for 60v
the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 51v is electron capture the next most common mode is beta decay the primary decay products before 51v are element 22 titanium isotopes and the primary products after are element 24 chromium isotopes
powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard and unless known otherwise all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic generally the higher the oxidation state of vanadium the more toxic the compound is the most dangerous compound is vanadium pentoxide
the occupational safety and health administration osha has set an exposure limit of 005 mgm3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 01 mgm3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8hour workday 40hour work week
the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has recommended that 35 mgm3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health this is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death

naturally occurring xenon is made of nine stable isotopes but there are also over 40 unstable isotopes that undergo radioactive decay the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the solar system
xenon is used in flash lamps the first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule xe2 as its lasing medium
xenon was discovered in england by william ramsay and morris travers on july 12 1898 shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon they found it in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air ramsay suggested the name xenon for this gas from the greek word ξένον xenon neuter singular form of ξένος xenos meaning foreign strange or host in 1902 ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the earths atmosphere as one part in 20 million
during the 1930s the engineer harold edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for highspeed photography this led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp in which light is generated by sending a brief electrical current through a tube filled with xenon gas in 1934 edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method
albert r behnke jr began exploring the causes of drunkenness in deepsea divers in 1939 he tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth from his results he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic although lazharev in russia apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941 the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by j h lawrence who experimented on mice xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by stuart c cullen who successfully operated on two patients
in 1960 the physicist john h reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon129 he inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine 129 as the halflife of 129i is 16 million years this demonstrated that the meteorites were formed during the early history of the solar system as the 129i isotope was likely generated before the solar system was formed
xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds however while teaching at the university of british columbia neil bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride ptf6 was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen o2 to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate o2 ptf6 minus since o2 and xenon have almost the same first ionization potential bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon on march 23 1962 he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas xenon hexafluoroplatinate bartlett thought its composition to be xe ptf6 minus although later work has revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenoncontaining salts since then many other xenon compounds have been discovered and some compounds of the noble gases argon krypton and radon have been identified including argon fluorohydride harf krypton difluoride krf2 and radon fluoride
xenon is a trace gas in earths atmosphere occurring at 00870001nbsp parts per million μll it is also found in gases emitted from some mineral springs some radioactive species of xenon for example 133xe and 135xe are produced by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors
xenon is obtained commercially as a byproduct of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen after this separation generally performed by fractional distillation in a doublecolumn plant the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon by additional fractional distillation steps the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 01ndash02 of a kryptonxenon mixture which is extracted either via adsorption onto silica gel or by distillation finally the kryptonxenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon via distillation extraction of a liter of xenon from the atmosphere requires 220 watthours of energy worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 50007000nbspm3 due to its low abundance xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gasesapproximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in europe in 1999 were 10nbsp l for xenon 1nbspl for krypton and 020nbspl for neon
xenon is relatively rare in the sun s atmosphere on earth and in the asteroids and comets the atmosphere of mars shows a similar xenon abundance to that of earth 008nbspparts per million however mars shows a higher proportion of 129xe than the earth or the sun as this isotope is generated by radioactive decay the result may indicate that mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed by contrast the planet jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere about 26 times as much as the sun this high abundance remains unexplained but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals mdashsmall subplanetary bodiesmdashbefore the presolar disk began to heat up otherwise xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices within the solar system the nucleon fraction for all isotopes of xenon is 156 times 108 or one part in 64nbspmillion of the total mass the problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere
unlike the lower mass noble gases the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon elements more massive than iron56 have a net energy cost to produce through fusion so there is no energy gain for a star to create xenon instead many isotopes of xenon are formed during supernova explosions
an atom of xenon is defined as having a nucleus with 54 protons at standard temperature and pressure pure xenon gas has a density of 5761nbspkgm3 about 45 times the surface density of the earths atmosphere 1217nbspkgm3 as a liquid xenon has a density of up to 3100nbspgml with the density maximum occurring at the triple point under the same conditions the density of solid xenon 3640nbspgcm3 is larger than the average density of granite 275nbspgcm3
xenon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble or inert gases it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion for example because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound however xenon can be oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents and many xenon compounds have been synthesized
in a gasfilled tube xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when the gas is excited by electrical discharge xenon emits a band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light which produces the coloration
naturally occurring xenon is made of nine stable isotopes the isotopes 124xe 134xe and 136xe are predicted to undergo double beta decay but this has never been observed so they are considered to be stable besides these stable forms there are over 40 unstable isotopes that have been studied 129xe is produced by beta decay of 129 i which has a halflife of 16nbspmillion years while 131mxe 133xe 133mxe and 135xe are some of the fission products of both 235 u and 239 pu and therefore used as indicators of nuclear explosions the various isotopes of xenon are produced from supernova explosions and the radioactive decay of elements such as iodine uranium and plutonium
the artificial isotope sup135supxe is of considerable significance in the operation of nuclear fission reactors 135xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons 26times106nbsp barns so it acts as a neutron absorber or poison that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation this was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the american manhattan project for plutonium production fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactors reactivity the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel
under adverse conditions relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may be found emanating from nuclear reactors due to the release of fission products from cracked fuel rods or fissioning of uranium in cooling water
because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the solar system the iodinexenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula xenon isotopic ratios such as 129xe130xe and 136xe130xe are also a powerful tool for understanding terrestrial differentiation and early outgassing excess 129xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from new mexico was believed to be from the decay of mantle derived gases soon after earths formation
see also categoryxenoncompounds xenon hexafluoroplatinate was the first chemical compound of xenon synthesized in 1962 xenon compounds found to date contain electronegative fluorine or oxygen when other atoms are bound such as hydrogen or carbon they are often part of a molecule containing fluorine or oxygen some compounds of xenon are colored but most are colorless
in 1995 a group of scientists at the university of helsinki in finland m räsänen and coworkers announced the preparation of xenon dihydride hxeh and later xenon hydridehydroxide hxeoh hydroxenoacetylene hxecch and other xecontaining molecules deuterated molecules hxeod and dxeoh have also been produced
as well as compounds where xenon forms a chemical bond xenon can form clathrates mdashsubstances where xenon atoms are trapped by the crystalline lattice of another compound an example is xenon hydrate xemiddot575 h2o where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules the deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure such as in lake vostok underneath the antarctic ice sheet clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon argon and krypton xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule the xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be monitored via 129xe nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using this technique chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed due to the sensitivity of the chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment however the xenon atom also has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene
although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the earths atmosphere it still has a number of applications
xenon is used in lightemitting devices called xenon flash lamps which are used in photographic flashes and stroboscopic lamps to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light and occasionally in bactericidal lamps the first solidstate laser invented in 1960 was pumped by a xenon flash lamp and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps
continuous shortarc high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators that is the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated blackbody radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the sun after they were first introduced during the 1940s these lamps began replacing the shorterlived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors they are employed in typical 35mm and imax film projection systems automotive hid headlights and other specialized uses these arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions in the near infrared which is used in some night vision systems
the individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes the interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display
xenon is used as a starter gas in high pressure sodium lamps it has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the nonradioactive noble gases as a noble gas it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp the low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state which allows the lamp to be more easily started
in 1962 a group of researchers at bell laboratories discovered laser action in xenon and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium the first excimer laser used a xenon dimer xe2 energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer or more accurately exciplex lasers the xenon chloride excimer laser has been employed for example in certain dermatological uses
xenon has been used as a general anesthetic although it is expensive even so anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the european market two mechanisms for xenon anesthesia have been proposed the first one involves the inhibition of the calcium atpase pump mdashthe mechanism cells use to remove calcium ca2mdashin the cell membrane of synapses this results from a conformational change when xenon binds to nonpolar sites inside the protein the second mechanism focuses on the nonspecific interactions between the anesthetic and the lipid membrane
xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration mac of 063 making it 50 more potent than n2o as an anesthetic thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of hypoxia unlike nitrous oxide n2o xenon is not a greenhouse gas and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly because of the high cost of xenon however economic application will require a closed system so that the gas can be recycled with the gas being appropriately filtered for contaminants between uses
gamma emission from the radioisotope 133xe of xenon can be used to image the heart lungs and brain for example by means of single photon emission computed tomography 133xe has also been used to measure blood flow
nuclei of only two of the stable isotopes of xenon 129xe and 131xe have nonzero intrinsic angular momenta nuclear spins when mixed with alkali vapor and nitrogen their nuclear spins can be aligned along the laser beam of circularlypolarized light that is tuned to an absorption line of the alkali atoms typically pure rubidium metal heated above 100 c is used to produce the alkali vapor this alignment spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass 50 of its maximum possible value greatly exceeding the equilibrium value dictated by the boltzmann distribution typically 0001 of the maximum value at room temperature even in the strongest magnets such nonequilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition and is called hyperpolarization because the 129xe isotope has a nuclear spin value of 12 and therefore the electric quadrupole moment of 129xe nucleus must be zero 129xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alcali vapor removed by condensation on a roomtemperature surface the time it takes for a collection of spins to return to their equilibrium boltzmann polarization is called the tsub1sub relaxation time for 129xe isotope it can range from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and to several days in the deeplyfrozen solid xenon in contrast the sup131supxe isotope has a nuclear spin value of 32 does possess a nonzero quadrupole moment and has t1 relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges the hyperpolarization process such as spinexchange optical pumping described above renders the 129xe isotope much more detectable via magnetic resonance imaging and has been used for studies of the lungs and other tissues it can be used for example to trace the flow of gases within the lungs
in nuclear energy applications xenon is used in bubble chambers probes and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert nature is desirable liquid xenon is being used as a medium for detecting hypothetical weakly interactive massive particles or wimps when a wimp collides with a xenon nucleus it should theoretically strip an electron and create a primary scintillation by using xenon this burst of energy could then be readily distinguished from similar events caused by particles such as cosmic rays however the xenon experiment at the gran sasso national laboratory in italy has thus far failed to find any confirmed wimps even if no wimps are detected though the experiment will serve to constrain the properties of dark matter and some physics models the current detector at this facility is five times as sensitive as other instruments worldwide and the sensitivity will be increased by an order of magnitude in 2008
xenon is the preferred fuel for ion propulsion of spacecraft because of its low ionization potential per atomic weight the ability to store it as a liquid at near room temperature but at high pressure yet easily converts back into a gas to fuel the engine the inert nature of xenon makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s it was later employed as a propellant for europes smart1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on nasas dawn spacecraft
chemically the perxenate compounds are used as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems mems the anticancer drug 5fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil xenon is also used in protein crystallography applied at pressures from 05 to 5nbsp mpa 5 to 50nbsp atm to a protein crystal xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities often creating a high quality isomorphous heavyatom derivative which can be used for solving the phase problem
xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure however it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials xenon is non toxic although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the bloodbrain barrier causing mild anaesthesia when inhaled in very high concentrations see anesthesia subsection above many of xenon compounds are explosive and toxic due to their strong oxidative properties
at 169nbspms the speed of sound in xenon gas is slower than that in air due to the slower average speed of the heavy xenon atoms compared to nitrogen and oxygen molecules so xenon lowers the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract when inhaled this produces a characteristic lowered voice pitch opposite the highpitched voice caused by inhalation of helium like helium xenon does not satisfy the bodys need for oxygen and is a simple asphyxiant consequently many universities no longer allow the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration as xenon is expensive the gas sulfur hexafluoride which is similar to xenon in molecular weight 146 versus 131 is generally used in this stunt although it too is an asphyxiant
it is possible to safely breathe heavy gases such as xenon or sulfur hexafluoride when they include a 20 mixture of oxygen the lungs mix the gases very effectively and rapidly so that the heavy gases are purged along with the oxygen and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs there is however a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities it may sit invisibly in a container and if a person enters a container filled with an odorless colorless gas they may find themselves breathing it unknowingly xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space

yttrium named for ytterby a swedish village near vaxholm was discovered by finnish chemist physicist and mineralogist johan gadolin in 1794 and isolated by friedrich wöhler in 1828 as an impure extract of yttria through the reduction of yttrium anhydrous chloride y cl 3 with potassium yttria y2o3 is the oxide of yttrium and was discovered by johan gadolin in 1794 in a gadolinite mineral from ytterby
in 1843 the swedish chemist carl mosander was able to show that yttria could be divided into the oxides or earths of three different elements yttria was the name which was retained for the most basic one which also happened to comprise the bulk of the crude mixture typically about twothirds and the others were renamed erbia and terbia later in the 19th century both of these would also be shown to be complex although the names would be retained for the most characteristic component of each
a quarry is located near the village of ytterby that yielded many unusual minerals that contained rare earths and other elements the elements erbium terbium ytterbium and yttrium have all been named after this same small village
this element is found in almost all rareearth minerals and in uranium ores but is never found in nature as a free element yttrium is commercially recovered from monazite sand 3 content ce la etc posub4sub and from bastnäsite 02 content ce la etc co 3 f it is commercially produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal but it can also be produced using other techniques it is difficult to separate from other rare earths and when extracted is a dark gray powder the original rare earths ceria 1803 and yttria 1794 reflect the great geochemical divide that occurs between the light and heavy lanthanides due to lanthanide contraction the lighter lanthanides with a larger radius partition into minerals in sites with a higher coordination number eg monazite whereas the smaller heavy lanthanides prefer a slightly lower coordination number as in xenotime the lighter lanthanides are also more relatively abundant in the earths outer crust than the heavies relative to the abundance in chondritic meteorites due to size fractionation yttrium falls into the middle of the heavy group in size and thus inevitably occurs with these in minerals where it comprises about twothirds of the mixed oxides by weight this composition is typical of gadolinite xenotime and certain ion adsorption clays currently mined in the south of china
lunar rock samples from the apollo program have a relatively high yttrium content
see also yttrium minerals natural yttrium is composed of only one isotope y89 the most stable radioisotopes are y88 which has a half life of 10665 days and y91 with a half life of 5851 days all the other isotopes have half lives of less than a day except y87 which has a half life of 798 hours the dominant decay mode below the stable y89 is electron capture and the dominant mode after it is beta emission twenty six unstable isotopes have been characterized
y90 exists in equilibrium with its parent isotope strontium 90 which is a product of nuclear explosions
compounds that contain this element are rarely encountered by most people but should be considered to be highly toxic even though many compounds pose little risk yttrium salts may be carcinogenic this element is not normally found in human tissue and plays no known biological role
yttrium compounds erbium terbium ytterbium webelementscom ndash yttrium los alamos national laboratory ndash yttrium ytterbium is a chemical element with the symbol yb and atomic number 70 a soft silvery metallic element ytterbium is a rare earth of the lanthanide series and is found in the minerals gadolinite monazite and xenotime the element is sometimes associated with yttrium or other related elements and is used in certain steels natural ytterbium is a mix of seven stable isotopes
ytterbium is a soft malleable and rather ductile element that exhibits a bright silvery luster a rare earth element it is easily attacked and dissolved by mineral acids slowly reacts with water and oxidizes in air
ytterbium has three allotropes which are called alpha beta and gamma and whose transformation points are at minus13 c and 795 c the beta form exists at room temperature and has a facecentered crystal structure while the hightemperature gamma form has a bodycentered crystal structure
normally the beta form has a metallic like electrical conductivity but becomes a semiconductor when exposed to around 16000 atm 16 gpa its electrical resistivity is tenfold larger at about 39000 atm 39 gpa but then drops dramatically to around 10 of its room temperature resistivity value at 40000 atm 4 gpa
ytterbium is one of the lanthanides that is able to become divalent like the other potentially divalent lanthanides samarium and europium it is capable of being extracted into mercury by the use of sodium amalgam which made it one of the easier lanthanides to purify using classical techniques however this divalency was not discovered until the 20th century
usually very small anount of yb is used either small sample of radioactive isotope as source of xrays or small concentration dopant
the 169yb isotope has been used as a radiation source substitute for a portable xray machine when electricity was not available like xrays gamma rays pass through soft tissues of the body but are blocked by bones and other dense materials thus small 169yb samples which emit gamma rays act like tiny xray machines useful for radiography of small objects
ytterbium could also be used to help improve the grain refinement strength and other mechanical properties of stainless steel some ytterbium alloys have been used in dentistry
yb is used as dopant in optics materials usially in the form of ions in active laser media several powerful doubleclad fiber lasers and disk lasers use yb3 ions as dopant at concentration of several atomic percent glasses optical fibers crystals and ceramics with yb3 are used
ytterbium is often used as a doping material as yb3 for high power and wavelengthtunable solid state lasers yb lasers commonly radiate in the 106112µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm 1µm dependently on the ghost and application small quantum defect makes yb prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling
the kinetic of excitations in ybdoped materials is simple and can be described within concept of effective crosssections for the most of ybdoped laser materials the mccumber relation holds although the application to the ybdoped composite materials was under discussion
usually low concentrtations of yb are used at high concentration of excitaitons the ybdoped materials show photodarkening glass fibers or ever switch to the broadband emission crystals and ceramics instead of the efficient laser action
ytterbium has a single absorption band at 985 nanometers which is used to convert infrared energy into electricity in solar cells
ytterbium was discovered by the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac in 1878 marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia and named it ytterbia after ytterby the swedish town where he found the new erbia component he suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element he called ytterbium
in 1907 the french chemist georges urbain separated marignacs ytterbia into two components neoytterbia and lutecia neoytterbia would later become known as the element ytterbium and lutecia would later be known as the element lutetium auer von welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time but called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium
the chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined until 1953 when the first nearly pure ytterbium was produced
ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals it is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand 003 ytterbium the element is also found in euxenite and xenotime ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths but ionexchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the late 20th century have simplified separation known compounds of ytterbium are raremdashthey havent been well characterized yet
naturally occurring ytterbium is composed of 7 stable isotopes yb168 yb170 yb171 yb172 yb173 yb174 and yb176 with yb174 being the most abundant 3183 natural abundance 27 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being yb169 with a halflife of 32026 days yb175 with a halflife of 4185 days and yb166 with a half life of 567 hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflifes that are less than 2 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 20 minutes this element also has 12 meta states with the most stable being yb169m t 46 seconds
the isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 1479674 u yb148 to 1809562 u yb181 the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope yb174 is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before yb174 are element 69 thulium isotopes and the primary products after are element 71 lutetium isotopes of interest to modern quantum optics the different ytterbium isotopes follow either boseeinstein statistics or fermidirac statistics leading to interesting behavior in optical lattices
although ytterbium is fairly stable it nevertheless should be stored in closed containers to protect it from air and moisture all compounds of ytterbium should be treated as highly toxic although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is limited ytterbium compounds are however known to cause skin and eye irritation and may be teratogenic metallic ytterbium dust poses a fire and explosion hazard

zinc is a moderately reactive blue gray metal that tarnishes in moist air and burns in air with a bright bluishgreen flame giving off plumes of zinc oxide it reacts with acids alkalis and other nonmetals if not completely pure zinc reacts with dilute acids to release hydrogen the one common oxidation state of zinc is 2 from 100 c to 210 c to zinc metal is malleable and can easily be beaten into various shapes above the metal becomes brittle and will be pulverized by beating zinc is nonmagnetic
in ancient india the production of zinc metal was very common many mine sites of zawar mines near udaipur rajasthan zawarmaala were active even during 13001000 bc there are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the charaka samhita 300 bc the rasaratna samuccaya 800 ad explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose zinc alloys have been used for centuries as brass goods dating to 14001000 bc have been found in israel and zinc objects with 87 zinc have been found in prehistoric transylvania because of the low boiling point and high chemical reactivity of this metal isolated zinc would tend to go up the chimney rather than be captured the true nature of this metal was not understood in ancient times
the manufacture of brass was known to the ebi by about 30 bc using a technique where calamine and copper were heated together in a crucible the zinc oxides in calamine were reduced and the free zinc metal was trapped by the copper forming an alloy the resulting calamine brass was either cast or hammered into shape
smelting and extraction of impure forms of zinc was accomplished as early as 1000 ad in india and china in the west impure zinc as a remnant in melting ovens was known since antiquity but usually discarded as worthless strabo mentions it as pseudoarguros mdash mock silver the berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to roman gaul probably made from such zinc remnants
the metallurgist andreas libavius received in 1597 a quantity of zinc metal in its pure form which was unknown in the west before then libavius identified it as indianmalabar lead paracelsus 1516 was credited for the name zinc it was regularly imported to europe from the orient in the 17th century but was at times very expensive
the isolation of metallic zinc in the west may have been achieved independently by several people
dr john lane is said to have carried out experiments probably at landore prior to his bankruptcy in 1726 postlewayt s universal dictionary a contemporary source giving technological information in europe did not mention zinc before 1751
in 1738 william champion patented in great britain a process to extract zinc from calamine in a smelter using a technology somewhat similar to that used at zawar zinc mines in rajasthan however there is no evidence that he visited the orient
the discovery of pure metallic zinc is also often credited to the german andreas marggraf in 1746 though the whole story is disputed
before the discovery of the zinc sulfide flotation technique calamine was the mineral source of zinc metal
zinc is an essential element necessary for sustaining all life it is estimated that 3000 of the hundreds of thousands of proteins in the human body contain zinc prosthetic groups one type of which is the socalled zinc finger in addition there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied zinc ions are now considered neurotransmitters cells in the salivary gland prostate immune system and intestine are other types that secrete zinc
zinc is an activator of certain enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase carbonic anhydrase is important in the transport of carbon dioxide in vertebrate blood it is also required in plants for leaf formation the synthesis of indole acetic acid auxin and anaerobic respiration alcoholic fermentation
zinc is found in oysters and to a far lesser degree in most animal proteins beans nuts almonds whole grains pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds a turkey s neck and beef s chuck or shank also contain good amounts of zinc phytates which are found in whole grain breads cereals legumes and other products have been known to decrease zinc absorption clinical studies have found that zinc combined with antioxidants may delay progression of agerelated macular degeneration significant dietary intake of zinc has also recently been shown to impede the onset of flu soil conservation analyzes the vegetative uptake of naturally occurring zinc in many soil types
the us recommended dietary allowance of zinc from puberty on is 11mg for males and 8mg for females with higher amounts recommended during pregnancy and lactation
zinc deficiency results from inadequate intake of zinc or inadequate absorption of zinc into the body signs of zinc deficiency include hair loss skin lesions diarrhea and wasting of body tissues eyesight taste smell and memory are also connected with zinc a deficiency in zinc can cause malfunctions of these organs and functions congenital abnormalities causing zinc deficiency may lead to a disease called acrodermatitis enteropathica
obtaining a sufficient zinc intake during pregnancy and in young children is a very real problem especially among those who cannot afford a good and varied diet brain development is stunted by zinc insufficiency in utero and in youth
it is rarely recognised that lack of zinc can contribute to acne leukonychia purple spots on the fingernails are often seen as an indication of zinc deficiency
zinc deficiency causes a decrease in appetite which could degenerate in anorexia nervosa an appetite disorders in turn cause malnutrition and notably inadequate zinc intake the use of zinc in the treatment of anorexia nervosa has been advocated since 1979 by bakan at least 15 trials showed that zinc improved weight gain in anorexia a 1994 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial showed that zinc 14 mg per day doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa an deficiency of other nutrients such as tyrosine and tryptophan precursors of the monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin respectively as well as vitamin b1 thiamine could contribute to this phenomenon of malnutritioninduced malnutrition
even though zinc is an essential requirement for a healthy body too much zinc can be harmful excessive absorption of zinc can also suppress copper and iron absorption the free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants invertebrates and even vertebrate fish the free ion activity model fiam is wellestablished in the literature and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms a recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93 of all daphnia in water swallowing a post 1982 american one cent piece 975 zinc can also cause damage to the stomach lining due to the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach zinc toxicity mostly in the form of the ingestion of us pennies minted after 1982 is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia in pet parrots zinc is highly toxic and poisoning can often be fatal
there is evidence of induced copper deficiency at low intakes of 100300 mg znd the usda rda is 15 mg znd even lower levels closer to the rda may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or to adversely affect cholesterol
see also zinc gluconate zinc salts are effective against pathogens in direct application gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc and this effect could be due to direct antimicrobial action of the zinc ions in the gi tract or to absorption of the zinc and rerelease from immune cells all granulocytes secrete zinc or both
in clinical trials both zinc gluconate and zinc gluconate glycine the formulation used in lozenges have been shown to shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold the amount of glycine can vary from two to twenty moles per mole of zinc gluconate

the earth has been estimated to have 46 years supply of zinc
there are zinc mines throughout the world with the largest producers being china australia and peru in 2005 china produced almost onefourth of the global zinc output reports the british geological survey mines and refineries in europe include umicore in belgium tara galmoy and lisheen in ireland and zinkgruvan in sweden zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy zinc sulfide sphalerite minerals are concentrated using the froth flotation method and then usually roasted using pyrometallurgy to oxidise the zinc sulfide to zinc oxide the zinc oxide is leached to zinc sulfate znso4 in several stages of increasingly stronger sulfuric acid h2so4 iron is usually rejected as jarosite or goethite removing other impurities at the same time the final purification uses zinc dust to remove copper cadmium and cobalt in two to three different stages the metal is then extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by electrowinning as cathodic deposits over aluminium sheets zinc cathodes can be directly cast or alloyed with aluminium
electrolyte zinc sulfate solutions must be very pure for electrowinning to be at all efficient impurities can change the decomposition voltage enough to where the electrolysis cell produces largely hydrogen gas rather than zinc metal
there are two common processes for electrowinning the metal the low current density process and the tainton high current density process the former uses a 10 sulfuric acid solution as the electolyte with current density of 270325 amperes per square meter the latter uses 2228 sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1000 amperes per square meter the latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte but has the disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel in which it is done in either of the electrolytic processes each metric ton of zinc production expends about 3900 kwh 14 mj of electric power
there are also several pyrometallurgical processes that reduce zinc oxide using carbon then distill the metallic zinc from the resulting mix in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide these include the belgiantype horizontalretort process the new jersey zinc continuous verticalretort process and the st joseph lead companys electrothermal process the belgian process requires redistillation to remove impurities of lead cadmium iron copper and arsenic the new jersey process employs a fractionating column which is absent in the belgian process that separates the individual impurities where they can be sold as byproducts the st joseph lead company process heats the zinc oxidecoke mixture by passing an electric current through it rather than by coal or gas fire
another pyrometallurgical process is flash smelting then zinc oxide is obtained usually producing zinc of lesser quality than the hydrometallurgical process zinc oxide treatment has much fewer applications but high grade deposits have been successful in producing zinc from zinc oxides and zinc carbonates using hydrometallurgy
the most widely used alloy of zinc is brass in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 9 to 45 zinc depending upon the type of brass along with much smaller amounts of lead and tin alloys of 8588 zinc 410 copper and 28 aluminum find limited use in certain types of machine bearings alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper aluminum and magnesium are useful in die casting an example of this is zinc aluminum similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be coldrolled into sheets an alloy of 96 zinc and 4 aluminum is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications where ferrous metal dies would be too expensive
see also zinc compounds zinc oxide is perhaps the best known and most widely used zinc compound as it makes a good base for white pigments in paint it also finds industrial use in the rubber industry and is sold as opaque sunscreen a variety of other zinc compounds find use industrially such as zinc chloride in deodorants zinc pyrithione anti dandruff shampoos zinc sulfide in luminescent paints and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory roughly one quarter of all zinc output is consumed in the form of zinc compounds
naturally occurring zinc is composed of the 5 stable isotopes 64zn 66zn 67zn 68zn and 70zn with 64zn being the most abundant 486 natural abundance twentyone radioisotopes have been characterised with the most abundant and stable being 65zn with a halflife of 24426 days and 72zn with a halflife of 465 hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 14 hours and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 1 second this element also has 4 meta states
zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt is another betterknown salting material a jacket of isotopically enriched 64zn irradiated by the intense highenergy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon would transmute into the radioactive isotope zn65 with a halflife of 244 days and produce approximately 227 mev of gamma radiation significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapons fallout for several days such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used
metallic zinc is not considered to be toxic but free zinc ions in solution like copper or iron ions are highly toxic there is also a condition called zinc shakes or zinc chills see metal fume fever that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials excessive intake of zinc can promote deficiency in other dietary minerals

zirconium is a grayishwhite metal lustrous and quite corrosionresistant zirconium is lighter than steel and its hardness is similar to copper when it is finely divided into a powder zirconium can spontaneously ignite in air especially at high temperatures it is much more difficult to ignite the solid metal the zirconiumzinc alloy becomes magnetic at temperatures below 35 k the oxidation state of zirconium is usually 4 although 3 and 2 can also be obtained inside of chemical compounds
zirconium from syriac zargono arabic zarkûn from persian zargûn زرگون meaning gold like was discovered in 1789 by martin heinrich klaproth and it was isolated in 1824 by jöns jakob berzelius
the zirconiumcontaining mineral zircon or its variations jargon hyacinth jacinth or ligure were mentioned in biblical writings the mineral was not known to contain a new element until klaproth analyzed a jargon from the island of ceylon in the indian ocean he named the new element zirkonertz zirconia the impure metal was isolated first by berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassiumzirconium fluoride in a small decomposition process conducted in an iron tube pure zirconium wasnt prepared until 1914
the crystal bar process or iodide process discovered by anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer in 1925 was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure metallic zirconium it was later superseded by the kroll process
zirconium is never found in nature as a native metal the principal economic source of zirconium is the zirconium silicate mineral zircon zrsio4 which is found in deposits located in australia south africa and the united states as reported by the british geological survey it is extracted either as a dark sooty powder or as a gray metallic crystalline substance zirconium and hafnium are contained in zircon at a ratio of about 50 to 1 and they are quite difficult to separate chemically zircon is a coproduct or byproduct of the mining and processing of heavymineral sands for the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile or from tin minerals zirconium also occurs in about 30 other recognized mineral species including baddeleyite this metal is commercially produced mostly by the reduction of the zirconiumiv chloride with magnesium metal in the kroll process commercialquality zirconium for most uses still has a content of 1 to 3 hafnium

mercury is used in thermometers barometers manometers sphygmomanometers float valves and other scientific apparatus though concerns about the elements toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favour of alcohol filled digital or thermistor based instruments it remains in use in a number of other ways in scientific and scientific research applications and in dental amalgam mercury is mostly obtained by reduction from the mineral cinnabar
mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world and it is harmless in an insoluble form such as mercuric sulfide but it is poisonous in soluble forms such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury
mercury was known to the ancient chinese and hindus and was found in egyptian tombs that date from 1500 bc in china india and tibet mercury use was thought to prolong life heal fractures and maintain generally good health chinas first emperor qin shi huang di mdash said to have been buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury representative of the rivers of china mdash qin was driven insane and killed by mercury pills failing liver poison brain death intended to give him eternal life the ancient greeks used mercury in ointments and the romans used it in cosmetics by 500 bc mercury was used to make amalgams with other metals the indian word for alchemy is rasavātam which means the way of mercury
alchemists often thought of mercury as the first matter from which all metals were formed they believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury the purest of these was gold and mercury was required for the transmutation of base or impure metals into gold as was the goal of many alchemists
hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury it comes from hydrargyrum a latinized form of the greek word υδραργυρος hydrargyros which is a compound word meaning water and silver mdash since it is liquid like water and yet has a silvery metallic sheen the element was named after the roman god mercury known for speed and mobility it is associated with the planet mercury the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name
mercury is an extremely rare element in the earths crust having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 008 parts per million however because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the elements abundance in ordinary rock the richest mercury ores contain up to 25 mercury by mass and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 01 mercury 12000 times average crustal abundance
it is found either as a native metal rare or in cinnabar corderoite livingstonite and other minerals with cinnabar hg s being the most common ore mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the earth often in hot springs or other volcanic regions
over 100000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of huancavelica peru over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563 mercury from huancavelica was crucial in the production of silver in colonial spanish america many former ores in italy slovenia the united states and mexico which once produced a large proportion of the worlds supply have now been completely mined out the metal is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor the equation for this extraction is hgs o2 hg so2
in 2005 china was the top producer of mercury with almost twothirds global share followed by kyrgyzstan reports the british geological survey several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents
due to minimal surface disruption mercury mines lend themselves to constructive reuse for example in 1976 santa clara county california purchased the historic almaden quicksilver mine and proceeded to create a county park on the site after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property

for nuclear reactors however sodium is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant liquid mercury has been proposed as a working fluid for a heat pipe type of cooling device for spacecraft heat rejection systems or radiation panels mercury was a propellant for early ion engines in electric propulsion systems advantages were mercurys high molecular weight low ionization energy low dualionization energy high liquid density and liquid storability at room temperature disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in longduration operations the first

there are seven stable isotopes of mercury with hg202 being the most abundant 2986 the longestlived radioisotopes are 194hg with a halflife of 444 years and 203hg with a halflife of 46612 days most of the remaining radioisotopes have halflives that are less than a day 199hg and 201hg are the most often studied nmr active nuclei having spins of 12 and 32 respectively
mercury dissolves to form amalgams with gold zinc and many metals because iron is an exception to this rule iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury when heated mercury also reacts with oxygen in air to form mercury oxide which then can be decomposed by further heating to higher temperatures
since it is below hydrogen in the reactivity series of metals mercury does not react with most acids such as dilute sulfuric acid though oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate and nitrate and chloride similar to silver mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide mercury even reacts with solid sulfur flakes which is used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury vapors spill kits also use activated charcoal and powdered zinc
the most important salts are mercuryi chloride aka calomel is sometimes still used in medicine and acoustooptical filters mercuryii chloride which is very corrosive sublimates and is a violent poison mercury fulminate a detonator widely used in explosives mercuryii oxide the main oxide of mercury mercuryii sulfide aka cinnabar mercuric ore still used in oriental medicine or vermilion which is a highgrade paint pigment mercuryii selenide a semiconductor mercuryii telluride a semiconductor and mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride infrared detector materials

the discovery of mercuryiv fluoride hgf4 was announced in september 2007
see also categorymercury compounds mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and are generally handled with care in cases of spills involving mercury such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid toxic exposure it can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation heating of mercury or compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated should always be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to avoid exposure to mercury vapor the most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury
due to the health effects of mercury exposure industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries the world health organization osha and niosh all treat mercury as an occupational hazard and have established specific occupational exposure limits environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the us primarily by the united states environmental protection agency
case control studies have shown effects such as tremors impaired cognitive skills and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapour even at low concentrations in the range 0742 μgm3
a study has shown that acute exposure 48 hours to calculated elemental mercury levels of 11 to 44 mgm3 resulted in chest pain dyspnea cough hemoptysis impairment of pulmonary function and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis
acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium hallucinations and suicidal tendency occupational exposure has resulted in broadranging functional disturbance including erethism irritability excitability excessive shyness and insomnia with continuing exposure a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids lips and tongue longterm lowlevel exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism including fatigue irritability loss of memory vivid dreams and depression
research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators nacetyldlpenicillamine nap british antilewisite bal 23dimercapto1propanesulfonic acid dmps and dimercaptosuccinic acid dmsa in one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury patients were treated with dmsa and nap chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury dmsa was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than nap
fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies often in the form of methylmercury a highly toxic organic compound of mercury species of fish that are high on the food chain such as shark swordfish king mackerel albacore tuna and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others this is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish and when a predatory fish eats another fish it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury fishtissue concentrations increase over time thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher or more than the species they consume this process is called biomagnification the first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in minamata japan now called minamata disease
the complexities associated with mercury fate and transport are relatively succinctly described by usepa in their 1997 mercury study report to congress because methylmercury and high levels of elemental mercury can be particularly toxic to unborn or young children organizations such as the us epa and fda recommend that women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next one or two years as well as young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces one average meal of fish per week in the united states the fda has an action level for methyl mercury in commercial marine and freshwater fish that is 10 parts per million ppm and in canada the limit for the total of mercury content is 05 ppm
species with characteristically low levels of mercury include shrimp tilapia salmon pollock and catfish fda march 2004 the fda characterizes shrimp catfish pollock salmon and canned light tuna as lowmercury seafood although recent tests have indicated that up to 6 percent of canned light tuna may contain high levels
mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercuryaluminum amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact however when the amalgam is exposed to air the aluminium oxidizes leaving behind mercury the oxide flakes away exposing more mercury amalgam which repeats the process this process continues until the supply of amalgam is exhausted and since it releases mercury a small amount of mercury can eat through a large amount of aluminium over time by progressively forming amalgam and relinquishing the aluminium as oxide
aluminium in air is ordinarily protected by a moleculethin layer of its own oxide which is not porous to oxygen mercury coming into contact with this oxide does no harm however if any elemental aluminium is exposed even by a recent scratch the mercury may combine with it starting the process described above and potentially damaging a large part of the aluminium before it finally ends
for this reason restrictions are placed on the use and handling of mercury in proximity with aluminium in particular mercury is not allowed aboard aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft
in the european union directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment see rohs bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm
besides in the european union there are restriction for mercury concentration in packaging the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury lead hexavalent chromium and cadmium and batteries the limit is 5 ppm
in july 2007 european union also banned mercury in nonelectrical measuring devices such as thermometers and barometers the ban applies to new devices only and contains exemptions for the healthcare sector and a twoyear grace period for manufacurers of barometers
in norway there is a total ban on use of mercury in the manufacturing as well as import or export of mercury products the ban is efficient since january 1 2008 lakes in norway are already polluted by mercury

darmstadtium was first created on november 9 1994 at the gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung gsi in arheiligen a northern suburb of darmstadt germany by peter armbruster and gottfried münzenberg under the direction of professer sigurd hofmann a few atoms of it were produced by a nuclear fusion reaction caused by bombarding a lead target with nickel
the element was named after the place of its discovery darmstadt the new name was given to it by the iupac on august 16 2003
because the telephone number of the police is 110 within germany the element has also earned the nickname of policium
island of stability webelementscom darmstadtium iupac element 110 is named darmstadtium apsidium darmstadtium roentgenium formerly unununium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol rg and atomic number 111 making it one of the superheavy atoms it is a synthetic element whose longestlived isotope has a mass of 280 and a halflife of 36 seconds due to its presence in group 11 it is a transition metal
it was discovered by peter armbruster gottfried münzenber and their team working at the gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany on december 8 1994 only three atoms of it were observed all 272rg by the fusion of 209 bismuth and 64 nickel in a linear accelerator nickel was bombarded onto the bismuth target
the name roentgenium was accepted as a permanent name on november 1 2004 in honor of wilhelm conrad röntgen before this date the element was known under the temporary iupac systematic element name unununium symbol uuu some research has referred to it as eka gold
twelve isotopes of roentgenium are known the longestlived of these is 280rg which decays through alpha decay and has a halflife of 36 seconds the shortestlived isotope is 272rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half life of 15 ms another known isotope 279rg decays through alpha decay and has a halflife of 170 ms

in december 2000 the joint institute for nuclear research dubna russia published results that described the discovery in 2000 of decay of the isotope 292uuh which was produced in the reaction of 248 cm with 48 ca curium and calcium elements 96 and 20 respectively it has a halflife of about 18 milliseconds 0018 seconds and decayed into 288 uuq ununquadium element 114 on may 11 2001 the institute reported synthesizing a second atom and that the properties confirmed a region of enhanced stability see island of stability

ununhexium is a temporary iupac systematic element name
in october 2006 it was announced that on three occasions californium249 atoms had been bombarded with calcium 48 ions to produce ununoctium element 118 which decayed to ununhexium within a millisecond if confirmed the synthesis of element 116 will have been proven definitively
the reaction that created ununhexium is
this decayed 47 milliseconds later as follows to a previously identified isotope of element 114 uuq
in 1999 researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory announced the discovery of elements 116 and 118 ununhexium and ununoctium in a paper published in physical review letters the following year they published a retraction after other researchers were unable to duplicate the results in june 2002 the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by the principal author victor ninov

ununoctium is the temporary iupac name for the transactinide element having atomic number of 118 it can also be referred to as eka radon and it is currently the only synthetic member of the noble gases group and the highest atomic number assigned to a reputedly discovered element its temporary iupac element symbol is uuo only three atoms of this element have been detected the name ununoctium is a systematic element name used as a placeholder until it will be confirmed by other research groups and the iupac decides on a name moskowium mk has been proposed by their russian discoverers as the permanent name for the element
in late 1998 the polish theoreticist robert smolanczuk published some calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms including the element 118 his calculations suggested that it might be possible to make element 118 by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions
in 1999 researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements 116 and 118 in a paper published in physical review letters and very soon after the results were reported in science the researchers claimed to have performed the reaction
the following year they published a retraction after other researchers were unable to duplicate the results in june 2002 the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author victor ninov the american group had intended to name it ghiorsium after albert ghiorso a member of the research team before having to retract their claim
on october 16 2006 researchers from joint institute for nuclear research jinr and lawrence livermore national laboratory of california usa working at the jinr in dubna russia announced in physical review c that they had indirectly detected a total of three nuclei of ununoctium294 one in 2002 and two more in 2005 produced via collisions of californium 249 atoms and calcium48 ions
because of the very small fusion reaction probability the fusion cross section is 05 pb 51041 m2 the experiment took 4 months and involved a beam of 41019 calcium ions that had to be shot at the californium target to produce the single recorded event believed to be the synthesis of the element 118
in the experiment the decay products of three atoms of ununoctium rather than the atoms themselves were observed a halflife of 089 ms was observed 294uuo decays into 290 uuh by alpha decay since there were only three nuclei the halflife was derived from observed lifetimes and has a large uncertainty 089031107 ms
the identification of the 294uuo nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus 290uuh by means of a bombardment of 245 cm with 48 ca ions
and checking that the 290uuh decay matched the decay chain of the 294uuo nuclei
although the halflife seems to be less than a millisecond it is still longer than predicted thus giving further support to the idea of island of stability this concept proposed by late uc berkeley professor glenn seaborg explains why superheavy elements such as element 118 last longer than predicted
ununoctium has all its electrons in a closed shell which makes it a member of the noble gas group therefore it is most likely that it will have similar properties as other members of the group resembling in its chemical properties the noble gas above it in the periodic table radon there are no known compounds of ununoctium and because it is likely to have a high ionization energy the most common oxidation state will likely be 0 it is believed to be a gas under normal conditions
since only three atoms of ununoctium have ever been produced it currently has no uses outside of basic scientific research also because it does not occur at all in the biosphere it never presents a risk but it would constitute a radiation hazard if enough was ever assembled in one place
discoveries of the chemical elements transuranic element isotopes of ununoctium ununhexium ununpentium is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol uup and has the atomic number 115 multiple isotopes have been made by a fusion of calcium and americium uup288 with the most neutrons it can be referred to as eka bismuth
element 115 also falls in the center of the theoretical island of stability although no stable isotopes have yet been found conventional models predict that if stable isotopes of element 115 can be produced they will most likely need the magic number of 184 neutrons which would be uup299 the currently fabricated isotopes only had at most 173 neutrons uup288
on february 2 2004 synthesis of ununpentium and ununtrium were reported in physical review c by a team composed of russian scientists at dubna universitys joint institute for nuclear research and american scientists at the lawrence livermore national laboratory
the team reported that they bombarded americium element 95 with calcium element 20 to produce four atoms of ununpentium element 115 these atoms they report alpha decayed to ununtrium element 113 in approximately 100 milliseconds the ununtrium produced then existed for 12 seconds before decaying into natural elements
the synthesizing of the element was also reported by scientists of japan

ununpentium is a temporary iupac systematic element name element 115 is also sometimes called ekabismuth
for now element 115 has only been manufactured in the amount of a few atoms so the chemistry of element 115 has yet to be researched but chemistry and physics can tell us a lot about what to expect although element 115 is in the same group as bismuth its chemistry will probably be strongly altered by relativistic effects one important predicted difference from bismuth is the presence of a stable oxidation state of 1 and a uup ion with a chemistry similar to tl there has been some experimental data for other superheavy elements such as element 112 which seems to confirm relativistic effects for superheavy elements
ununpentium has been theorized to be inside the island of stability this probably explains why it was mentioned regularly in popular culture especially in ufo conspiracy theories the most popular account of element 115 from bob lazar would require changes to a great many existing theories

ununbium was first created on february 9 1996 at the gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany this element was created by fusing a zinc 70 nucleus with a lead 208 nucleus by accelerating zinc nuclei into a lead target in a heavy ion accelerator the two ununbium nuclei so produced had a mass number of 277
the element was synthesized in 2000 and 2004 in the joint institute for nuclear research russia

according to the island of stability theory some nuclides around the area of 114 protons and 184 neutrons ie isotope uuq298 can be expected to be relatively stable in comparison to the surrounding nuclides ununquadium does not occur naturally so it is entirely synthesized in laboratories all isotopes of ununquadium synthesized so far are neutronpoor this means that they contain significantly fewer neutrons than 184 which is one of the magic number of neutrons that is believed to make the isotope more stable neutronpoor also indicates that the isotopes decay either by spontaneous fission producing a variety of radionuclides positron emission or electron capture to yield element ununtrium so far all three that have been made have undergone spontaneous fission in the first 0012 milliseconds and therefore have never been able to be studied
manufacturing ununquadium298 would be very difficult because nuclei summing to 114 protons and 184 neutrons are not available in weighable quantities

copper is an essential trace nutrient to all high plants and animals in animals including humans it is found primarily in the bloodstream as a cofactor in various enzymes and in copperbased pigments however in sufficient amounts copper can be poisonous and even fatal to organisms
copper has played a significant part in the history of mankind which has used the easily accessible uncompounded metal for thousands of years civilizations in places such as iraq china egypt greece india and the sumerian cities all have early evidence of using copper during the roman empire copper was principally mined on cyprus hence the origin of the name of the metal as cyprium metal of cyprus later shortened to cuprum a number of countries such as chile and the united states still have sizable reserves of the metal which are extracted through large open pit mines high demand relative to supply has caused a price spike in the 2000s
copper as native copper is one of the few metals to naturally occur as an uncompounded mineral copper was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record and has a history of use that is at least 10000 years old a copper pendant was found in what is now northern iraq that dates to 8700 bc by 5000 bc there are signs of copper smelting the refining of copper from simple copper compounds such as malachite or azurite among archaeological sites in anatolia çatal höyük 6000 bc features native copper artifacts and smelted lead beads but no smelted copper but can hasan 5000 bc had access to smelted copper this site has yielded the oldest known cast copper artifact a copper mace head
copper smelting appears to have been developed independently in several parts of the world in addition to its development in anatolia by 5000 bc it was developed in china before 2800 bc in the andes around 2000 bc in central america around 600 ad and in west africa around 900 ad copper is found extensively in the indus valley civilization by the 3rd millennium bc in europe ötzi the iceman a wellpreserved male dated to 3200 bc was found with a coppertipped axe whose metal was 997 pure high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest he was involved in copper smelting there are copper and bronze artifacts from sumerian cities that date to 3000 bc and egyptian artifacts of copper and copper tin alloys nearly as old in one pyramid a copper plumbing system was found that is 5000 years old the egyptians found that adding a small amount of tin made the metal easier to cast so bronze alloys were found in egypt almost as soon as copper was found in the americas production in the old copper complex located in present day michigan and wisconsin was dated back to between 6000 to 3000 bc
by 2000 bc europe was using coppertin alloys or bronze the use of bronze became so pervasive in a certain era of civilization approximately 2500 bc to 600 bc in europe that it has been named the bronze age the transitional period in certain regions between the preceding neolithic period and the bronze age is termed the chalcolithic copperstone with some highpurity copper tools being used alongside stone tools brass was known to the greeks but only became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire
in greek the metal was known by the name chalkos χαλκός copper was a very important resource for the romans greeks and other ancient peoples in roman times it became known as aes cyprium aes being the generic latin term for copper alloys such as bronze and other metals and cyprium because so much of it was mined in cyprus from this the phrase was simplified to cuprum and then eventually anglicized into the english copper copper was associated with the goddess aphrodite venus in mythology and alchemy owing to its lustrous beauty its ancient use in producing mirrors and its association with cyprus which was sacred to the goddess
during the bronze age copper was mined in britain and ireland mainly in the following locations south west county cork west wales eg cwmwystwyth north wales eg great orme anglesey parys mountain cheshire alderley edge the staffordshire moorlands eg ecton mine isle of man which is between england and northern ireland
at great orme in north wales such working extended for a depth of 70 metres at alderley edge in cheshire carbon dates have established mining at around 2280 to 1890 bc at 95 probability
copper mining in the united states began with marginal workings by native americans and some development by early spaniards native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on isle royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600 ce europeans were mining copper in connecticut as early as 1709 perhaps the oldest operating largescale copper mine was the historic elizabeth mine in vermont dating to the 1700s the liz produced copper until it was closed in 1958 westward movement also brought an expansion of copper exploitation with developments of significant deposits in michigan and arizona during the 1850s and then in montana during the 1860s
native copper was mined extensively in michigan s keweenaw peninsula with the heart of extraction at the productive quincy mine arizona had many notable deposits including the copper queen in bisbee and the united verde in jerome the anaconda in butte montana became the nations chief copper supplier by 1886
copper is mined in many other areas of the united states including utah nevada and tennessee copper is the state mineral for utah
there are two stable isotopes 63cu and 65cu along with a couple dozen radioisotopes the vast majority of radioisotopes have half lives on the order of minutes or less the longest lived 67cu has a half life of 618 hours see also isotopes of copper
copper has a high electrical and thermal conductivity second only to silver among pure metals at room temperature
copper is a reddishcoloured metal it has its characteristic colour because of its band structure in its liquefied state a pure copper surface without ambient light appears somewhat greenish a characteristic shared with gold when liquid copper is in bright ambient light it retains some of its pinkish luster
copper occupies the same family of the periodic table as silver and gold since they each have one sorbital electron on top of a filled electron shell this similarity in electron structure makes them similar in many characteristics all have very high thermal and electrical conductivity and all are malleable metals
pure water and air copper is a metal that does not react with water h2o but the oxygen of the air will react slowly at room temperature to form a layer of copper oxide on copper metal
hydroxide it is important to note that in contrast to the oxidation of iron by wet air that the layer formed by the reaction of air with copper has a protective effect against further corrosion on old copper roofs a green layer of copper carbonate can often be seen
sulfide media copper metal does react with hydrogen sulfide and sulfide containing solutions a series of different copper sulfides can form on the surface of the copper metal
note that the copper sulfide area of the plot is very complex due to the existence of many different sulfides a close up is also provided to make the graph more clear it is clear that the copper is now able to corrode even without the need for oxygen as the copper is now less noble than hydrogen this can be observed in every day life when copper metal surfaces tarnish after exposure to air which contains sulfur compounds
ammonia media copper does react with oxygencontaining ammonia solutions because the ammonia forms watersoluble copper complexes the formation of these complexes causes the corrosion to become more thermodynamically favored than the corrosion of copper in an identical solution that does not contain the ammonia
chloride media copper does react with a combination of oxygen and hydrochloric acid to form a series of copper chlorides it is interesting to note that if copperii chloride greenblue is boiled with copper metal with little or no oxygen present then white copperi chloride will be formed
a single crystal copper consists of a few microns of small crystals in this form of crystal c the yield stress is high and crystal undergoes a large amount of elastic deformation before going into the plastic deformation region the plastic deformation region has an unpredictable outcome the stress level decreases significantly as necking begins to occur
polycrystal copper has many crystal of different geometries combined the plastic deformation of polycrystal is similar to mild steel copper has a high ductility and will continue to elongate as stress is applied it is very useful in copper wire drawing
numerous copper alloys exist many with important historical and contemporary uses speculum metal and bronze are alloys of copper and tin brass is an alloy of copper and zinc monel metal also called cupronickel is an alloy of copper and nickel while the metal bronze usually refers to coppertin alloys it also is a generic term for any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze silicon bronze and manganese bronze
copper is germicidal via the oligodynamic effect for example brass doorknobs disinfect themselves of many bacteria within a period of eight hours this effect is useful in many applications
in 2005 chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least onethird world share followed by the usa indonesia and peru reports the british geological survey
copper can be found as native copper in mineral form minerals such as the sulfides chalcopyrite cufes2 bornite cu5fes4 covellite cus chalcocite cu2s are sources of copper as are the carbonates azurite cu3co32oh2 and malachite cu2co3oh2 and the oxide cuprite cu2o
most copper ore is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 04 to 10 percent copper examples include chuquicamata in chile and el chino mine in new mexico the average abundance of copper found within crustal rocks is approximately 68 ppm by mass and 22 ppm by atoms
the intergovernmental council of copper exporting countries cipec defunct since 1992 once tried to play a similar role for copper as opec does for oil but never achieved the same influence not least because the secondlargest producer the united states was never a member formed in 1967 its principal members were chile peru zaire and zambia

copper is essential in all plants and animals copper is carried mostly in the bloodstream on a plasma protein called ceruloplasmin when copper is first absorbed in the gut it is transported to the liver bound to albumin copper is found in a variety of enzymes including the copper centers of cytochrome c oxidase and the enzyme superoxide dismutase containing copper and zinc in addition to its enzymatic roles copper is used for biological electron transport the blue copper proteins that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin the name blue copper comes from their intense blue color arising from a ligandtometal charge transfer lmct absorption band around 600nbspnm
most molluscs and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab use the coppercontaining pigment hemocyanin rather than iron containing hemoglobin for oxygen transport so their blood is blue when oxygenated rather than red
it is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other the rda for copper in normal healthy adults is 09 mg day on the other hand professional research on the subject recommends 30 mg day because of its role in facilitating iron uptake copper deficiency can often produce anemia like symptoms

in cases of suspected copper poisoning ovalbumin is to be administered in either of its forms which can be most readily obtained as milk or whites of eggs vinegar should not be given the inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles and so are the nervous
a significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state this catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions such as hydroxyl radical in a manner similar to fenton chemistry this catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes that it is associated with and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated this increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity
an inherited condition called wilsons disease causes the body to retain copper since it is not excreted by the liver into the bile this disease if untreated can lead to brain and liver damage in addition studies have found that people with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia had heightened levels of copper in their systems however it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness
too much copper in water has also been found to damage marine life the observed effect of these higher concentrations on fish and other creatures is damage to gills liver kidneys and the nervous system it also interferes with the sense of smell in fish thus preventing them from choosing good mates or finding their way to mating areas

praseodymium or is a chemical element that has the symbol pr and atomic number 59
praseodymium is a soft silvery metal in the lanthanide group it is somewhat more resistant to corrosion in air than europium lanthanum cerium or neodymium but it does develop a green oxide coating that spalls off when exposed to air exposing more metal to oxidation for this reason praseodymium should be stored under a light mineral oil or sealed in glass
uses of praseodymium cubic zirconia with no coloring although most compounds are green as an alloying agent with magnesium to create highstrength metals that are used in aircraft engines praseodymium forms the core of carbon arc lights which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights praseodymium compounds give glasses and enamels a yellow color praseodymium is used to color cubic zirconia yellowgreen to simulate peridot praseodymium is a component of didymium glass which is used to make certain types of welder s and glass blower s goggles the group of dr matthew sellars of the laser physics centre at the australian national university in canberra australia slowed down a light pulse to a few hundred meters per second using praseodymium mixed with silicate crystal praseodymium alloyed with nickel prni5 has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero doping praseodymium in fluoride glass can be used as single mode fiber amplifier praseodymium oxide in solid solution with ceria or with ceriazirconia have been used as oxidation catalysts
the name praseodymium comes from the greek prasios meaning green and didymos twin praseodymium is frequently misspelled as praseodynium
in 1841 mosander extracted the rare earth didymium from lanthana in 1874 per teodor cleve concluded that didymium was in fact two elements and in 1879 lecoq de boisbaudran isolated a new earth samarium from didymium obtained from the mineral samarskite in 1885 the austrian chemist baron carl auer von welsbach separated didymium into two elements praseodymium and neodymium which gave salts of different colors
leo moser not to be confused with leo moser a mathematician investigated the use of praseodymium in glass coloration in the late 1920s the result was a yellowgreen glass given the name prasemit however a similar color could be achieved with colorants costing only a minute fraction of what praseodymium cost in the late 1920s such that the color was not popular few pieces were made and examples are now extremely rare moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce heliolite glass heliolit in german which was more widely accepted the first enduring commercial use of praseodymium which continues today is in the form of a yelloworange stain for ceramics praseodymium yellow which is a solidsolution of praseodymium in the zirconium silicate zircon lattice this stain has no hint of green in it by contrast at sufficiently high loadings praseodymium glass is distinctly green rather than pure yellow
praseodymium has historically been a rare earth whose supply has exceeded demand unwanted as such much praseodymium has been marketed as a mixture with lanthanum and cerium or lcp for the first letters of each of the constituents for use in replacing the traditional lanthanide mixtures that were inexpensively made from monazite or bastnaesite lcp is what remains of such mixtures after the desirable neodymium and all the heavier rarer and more valuable lanthanides have been removed by solvent extraction however as technology progresses praseodymium has been found possible to incorporate into neodymiumironboron magnets thereby extending the supply of the much in demand neodymium so lc is starting to replace lcp as a result
praseodymium is available in small quantities in earths crust 95 ppm it is found in the rare earth minerals monazite and bastnasite typically comprising about 5 of the lanthanides contained therein and can be recovered from bastnasite or monazite by an ion exchange process or by countercurrent solvent extraction
praseodymium also makes up about 5 of misch metal

see also praseodymium compounds naturally occurring praseodymium is composed of one stable isotope 141pr thirtyeight radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 143pr with a halflife of 1357 days and 142pr with a halflife of 1912 hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 5985 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 33 seconds this element also has six meta states with the most stable being 138mpr t 212 hours 142mpr t 146 minutes and 134mpr t 11 minutes
the isotopes of praseodymium range in atomic weight from 120955 u 121pr to 158955 u 159pr the primary decay mode before the stable isotope 141pr is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta minus decay the primary decay products before 141pr are element 58 cerium isotopes and the primary products after are element 60 neodymium isotopes
like all rare earths praseodymium is of low to moderate toxicity praseodymium has no known biological role
webelementscom ndash praseodymium its elemental ndash the element praseodymium plutonium is a radioactive metallic and toxic chemical element it has the symbol pu and the atomic number 94 it is a fissile element used in most modern nuclear weapons the most significant isotope of plutonium is 239pu with a halflife of 24100 years it can be made from natural uranium the most stable isotope is 244pu with a halflife of about 80 million years long enough to be found in extremely small quantities in nature making 244pu the nucleon richest atom that naturally occurs in the earths crust albeit in small traces
plutonium has been called the most complex metal and a physicists dream but an engineers nightmare for its peculiar physical and chemical properties it has six allotropes normally and a seventh under pressure each of which have very similar energy levels but with significantly varying densities making it very sensitive to changes in temperature pressure or chemistry and allowing for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions in nuclear applications it is usually alloyed with a small amount of gallium which stabilizes it in the deltaphase plutonium is silvery in pure form but has a yellow tarnish when oxidized it possesses a lowsymmetry structure causing it to become progressively more brittle over time because it selfirradiates it ages both from the outsidein and the insideout however selfirradiation can also lead to annealing which counteracts some of the aging effects in general the precise aging properties of plutonium are very complex and poorly understood greatly complicating efforts to predict future reliability of weapons components
the heat given off by alpha particle emission makes plutonium warm to the touch in reasonable quantities it displays five ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution puiii as pu3 blue lavender puiv as pu4 yellow brown puv as puo2 thought to be pink this ion is unstable in solution and will disproportionate into pu4 and puo22 the pu4 will then oxidize the remaining puo2 to puo22 being reduced in turn to pu3 thus aqueous solutions of plutonium tend over time towards a mixture of pu3 and puo22 puvi as puo22 pink orange puvii as puo52 dark red the heptavalent ion is rare and prepared only under extreme oxidizing conditions the actual color shown by pu solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion which influences the degree of complexing of the pu species by the acid anion
the isotope 239pu is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons due to its ease of fissioning and availability the critical mass for an unreflected sphere of plutonium is 16 kg but through the use of a neutronreflecting tamper the pit of plutonium in a fission bomb is reduced to 10 kg which is a sphere with a diameter of 10 cm the manhattan project fat man type plutonium bombs using explosive compression of pu to significantly higher densities than normal were able to function with plutonium cores of only 62 kg complete detonation may be achieved through the use of an additional neutron source often from a small amount of fusion fuel the fat man bomb had an explosive yield of 21 kilotons see also nuclear weapon design
the isotope plutonium238 238pu has a halflife of 88 years and emits a large amount of thermal energy as it decays being an alpha emitter it combines high energy radiation with low penetration thereby requiring minimal shielding these characteristics make it well suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime it is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators such as those powering the cassini and new horizons pluto space probes earlier versions of the same technology powered the alsep and easep systems including seismic experiments on the apollo moon missions
238pu has been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers to reduce the risk of repeated surgery it has been largely replaced by lithium based primary cells but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutoniumpowered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients
the production of plutonium and neptunium by bombarding uranium238 with neutrons was predicted in 1940 by two teams working independently edwin m mcmillan and philip abelson at berkeley radiation laboratory at the university of california berkeley and by egon bretscher and norman feather at the cavendish laboratory of the university of cambridge for the tube alloys project coincidentally both teams proposed the same names to follow on from uranium following the sequence of the outer planets
plutonium was first produced and isolated on december 14 1940 by dr glenn t seaborg edwin m mcmillan j w kennedy and a c wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60inch cyclotron at berkeley the discovery was kept secret due to the war it was named after pluto having been discovered directly after neptunium which itself was one higher on the periodic table than uranium by analogy to solar system planet order as pluto was considered to be a planet at the time though technically it should have been plutium seaborg said that he did not think it sounded as good as plutonium seaborg chose the letters pu as a joke which passed without notice into the periodic table originally seaborg and others thought about naming the element ultinium or extremium because they believed at the time that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table
chemists at the university of chicago began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element the george herbert jones laboratory at the university was the site where on 18 august 1942 a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured for the first time this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new elements atomic weight room 405 of the building was named a national historic landmark in may 1967
during the manhattan project the first production reactor the x10 graphite reactor was built at the oak ridge tennessee site that later became oak ridge national laboratory later large 200mwt reactors were set up at the hanford site near richland washington for the production of plutonium which was used in the first atomic bomb used at the trinity test in july 1945 plutonium was also used in the fat man bomb dropped on nagasaki japan in august 1945 the little boy bomb dropped on hiroshima utilized uranium235 not plutonium
large stockpiles of weaponsgrade plutonium were built up by both the soviet union and the united states during the cold war the us reactors at hanford and the savannah river site in south carolina produced 103000 kg it was estimated there are another 170000 kg of military plutonium in russia with 300000 kg accumulated worldwide since the end of the cold war these stockpiles have become a focus of nuclear proliferation concerns in 2002 the united states department of energy took possession of 34 metric tons of excess weaponsgrade plutonium stockpiles from the united states department of defense and as of early 2003 was considering converting several nuclear power plants in the us from enriched uranium fuel to mox fuel as a means of disposing of plutonium stocks
during the initial years after the discovery of plutonium when its biological and physical properties were very poorly understood a series of human radiation experiments were performed by the us government and by private organizations acting on its behalf during and after the end of world war ii scientists working on the manhattan project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects in the case of human subjects this involved injecting solutions containing typically five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition these eighteen injections were made without the informed consent of those patients and were not done with the belief that the injections would heal their conditions rather they were used to develop diagnostic tools for determining the uptake of plutonium in the body for use in developing safety standards for people working with plutonium during the course of developing nuclear weapons
the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the hippocratic oath and has been sharply criticised as failing both the test of our national values and the test of humanity more sympathetic commentators have noted that while it was definitely a breach in trust and ethics the effects of the plutonium injections were not as damaging to the subjects as the early news stories painted nor were they so inconsequential as many scientists then and now believe
while almost all plutonium is manufactured synthetically extremely tiny trace amounts are found naturally in uranium ores these come about by a process of neutron capture by 238u nuclei initially forming 239u two subsequent beta decays then form 239pu with a 239 np intermediary which has a halflife of 24110 years this is also the process used to manufacture 239pu in nuclear reactors some traces of 244pu remain from the birth of the solar system from the waste of supernovae because its halflife of 80 million years is fairly long
a relatively high concentration of plutonium was discovered at the natural nuclear fission reactor in oklo gabon in 1972 since 1945 approximately 7700 kg has been released onto earth through nuclear explosions
the activation cross section for 239pu is 270 barns while the fission cross section is 747 barns for thermal neutrons the higher plutonium isotopes are created when the uranium fuel is used for a long time it is the case that for high burnup used fuel that the concentrations of the higher plutonium isotopes will be higher than the low burnup fuel which is reprocessed to obtain bomb grade plutonium
plutonium239 is one of the three fissile materials used for the production of nuclear weapons and in some nuclear reactors as a source of energy the other fissile materials are uranium235 and uranium233 plutonium239 is virtually nonexistent in nature it is made by bombarding uranium238 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor uranium238 is present in quantity in most reactor fuel hence plutonium239 is continuously made in these reactors since plutonium239 can itself be split by neutrons to release energy plutonium239 provides a portion of the energy generation in a nuclear reactor
it is clear to see that with a low flux of neutrons that 238u will be converted into 239pu
there are small amounts of pu238 in the plutonium of usual plutoniumproducing reactors however isotopic separation would be quite expensive compared to another method when a u235 atom captures a neutron it is converted to an excited state of u236 some of the excited u236 nuclei undergo fission but some decay to the ground state of u236 by emitting gamma radiation further neutron capture creates u237 which has a halflife of 7 days and thus quickly decays to np 237 since nearly all neptunium is produced in this way or consists of isotopes which decay quickly one gets nearly pure np237 by chemical separation of neptunium after this chemical separation np237 is again irradiated by reactor neutrons to be converted to np238 which decays to pu238 with a halflife of 2 days
plutonium reacts readily with oxygen forming puo and puosub2sub as well as intermediate oxides it reacts with the halogens giving rise to compounds such as pux3 where x can be f cl br or i pufsub4sub and puf6 are also seen the following oxyhalides are observed puocl puobr and puoi it will react with carbon to form puc nitrogen to form pun and silicon to form pusi2
plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core puo2 in the environment this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties oh no2 no3 and so42 to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil
puo2co312 puo2co324 puo2co336 puo2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric puo2 which is resistant to complexation plutonium also readily shifts valences between the 3 4 5 and 6 states it is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium
even at ambient pressure plutonium occurs in a variety of allotropes these allotropes differ widely in crystal structure and density the α and δ allotropes differ in density by more than 25 at constant pressure
the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult as it changes state very readily the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood recent research has focused on constructing accurate computer models of the phase transitions
in weapons applications plutonium is often alloyed with another metal eg delta phase with a small percentage of gallium to increase phase stability and thereby enhance workability and ease of handling interestingly in fission weapons the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha phase significantly helping to achieve supercriticality
twentyone plutonium radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable are pu244 with a halflife of 808 million years pu242 with a halflife of 373300 years and pu239 with a halflife of 24110 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have halflives that are less than 7000 years this element also has eight meta states though none are very stable all have halflives less than one second
the isotopes of plutonium range in atomic weight from 2280387 u pu228 to 247074 u pu247 the primary decay modes before the most stable isotope pu244 are spontaneous fission and alpha emission the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before pu244 are uranium and neptunium isotopes neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes and the primary products after are americium isotopes
key isotopes for applications are pu239 which is suitable for use in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors and pu238 which is suitable for use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators see above for more details the isotope pu240 undergoes spontaneous fission very readily and is produced when pu239 is exposed to neutrons the presence of pu240 in a material limits its nuclear bomb potential since it emits neutrons randomly increasing the difficulty of initiating accurately the chain reaction at the desired instant and thus reducing the bombs reliability and power plutonium consisting of more than about 90 pu239 is called weaponsgrade plutonium plutonium obtained from commercial reactors generally contains at least 20 pu240 and is called reactorgrade plutonium
pu240 while of little importance by itself plays a crucial role as a contaminant in plutonium used in nuclear weapons it spontaneously fissions at a high rate and a 1 impurity in pu239 will lead to unacceptably early initiation of a fission chain reaction in guntype atomic weapons eg the proposed thin man bomb blowing the weapon apart before much of its material can fission pu240 contamination is the reason plutonium weapons must use an implosion design a theoretical 100 pure pu239 weapon could be constructed as a guntype device but achieving this level of purity is prohibitively difficult pu240 contamination has proven a mixed blessing to weapons designers while it created delays and headaches during the manhattan project because of the need to develop implosion technology those very same difficulties are currently a barrier to nuclear proliferation implosion devices are also inherently more efficient and less prone toward accidental detonation than are guntype weapons
all isotopes and compounds of plutonium are toxic and radioactive while plutonium is sometimes described in media reports as the most toxic substance known to man from the standpoint of actual chemical or radiological toxicity this is incorrect when taken in by mouth plutonium is less poisonous than if inhaled since it is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested the us department of energy estimates the increase in lifetime cancer risk for inhaled plutonium as 3108 pci1 this means that inhaling 1μci or about 25μg of reactorgrade plutonium is estimated to increase ones lifetime risk of developing cancer as a result of the exposure to 3 when plutonium is absorbed into the body it is excreted very slowly with a biological halflife of 200 years
from a purely chemical standpoint it is about as poisonous as lead and other heavy metals not surprisingly it has a metallic taste plutonium may be extremely dangerous when handled incorrectly the alpha radiation it emits does not penetrate the skin but can irradiate internal organs when plutonium is inhaled or ingested particularly at risk are the skeleton where it is likely to be absorbed by the bone surface and the liver where it will likely collect and become concentrated approximately 0008 microcuries absorbed in bone marrow is the maximum withstandable dose anything more is considered toxic extremely fine particles of plutonium on the order of micrograms can cause lung cancer if inhaled
other substances including ricin tetrodotoxin botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin are fatal in doses of sometimes far under one milligram and others the nerve agents the amanita toxin are in the range of a few milligrams as such plutonium is not unusual in terms of toxicity even by inhalation in addition those substances are fatal in hours to days whereas plutonium and other cancercausing radioactives give an increased chance of illness decades in the future considerably larger amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and death if ingested or inhaled however so far no human is known to have immediately died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies
in contrast to naturally occurring radioisotopes such as radium or c14 plutonium was manufactured concentrated and isolated in large amounts hundreds of metric tons during the cold war for weapons production these stockpiles whether or not in weapons form pose a significant problem because unlike chemical or biological agents no chemical process can destroy them one proposal to dispose of surplus weaponsgrade plutonium is to mix it with highly radioactive isotopes eg spent reactor fuel to deter handling by potential thieves or terrorists another is to mix it with uranium and use it to fuel nuclear power reactors the mixed oxide or mox approach this would not only fission and thereby destroy much of the pu239 but also transmute a significant fraction of the remainder into pu240 and heavier isotopes that would make the resulting mixture useless for nuclear weapons
toxicity issues aside care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass particularly because plutoniums critical mass is only a third of that of uranium235s despite not being confined by external pressure as is required for a nuclear weapon it will nevertheless heat itself and break whatever confining environment it is in shape is relevant compact shapes such as spheres are to be avoided plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water a weaponscale nuclear explosion cannot occur accidentally since it requires a greatly supercritical mass in order to explode rather than simply melt or fragment however a marginally critical mass will cause a lethal dose of radiation and has in fact done so in the past on several occasions
criticality accidents have occurred in the past some of them with lethal consequences careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 62 kg plutonium sphere resulted in a lethal dose of radiation at los alamos on august 21 1945 when scientist harry k daghlian jr received a dose estimated to be 510 rems 51 sv and died four weeks later nine months later another los alamos scientist louis slotin died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core the socalled demon core that had previously claimed the life of daghlian these incidents were fictionalized in the 1989 film fat man and little boy in 1958 during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel which resulted in the death of a crane operator other accidents of this sort have occurred in the soviet union japan and many other countries see list of nuclear accidents the 1986 chernobyl accident caused a minor release of plutonium
metallic plutonium is also a fire hazard especially if the material is finely divided it reacts chemically with oxygen and water which may result in an accumulation of plutonium hydride a pyrophoric substance that is a material that will ignite in air at room temperature plutonium expands considerably in size as it oxidizes and thus may break its container the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard magnesiumoxide sand is the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire it cools the burning material acting as a heat sink and also blocks off oxygen there was a major plutoniuminitiated fire at the rocky flats plant near boulder colorado in 1969 to avoid these problems special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form generally a dry inert atmosphere is required

krypton greek κρυπτόν kryptos meaning hidden was discovered in great britain in 1898 by sir william ramsay and morris travers in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air william ramsay was awarded the 1904 nobel prize in chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases including krypton
in 1960 an international agreement defined the meter in terms of wavelength of light emitted by the krypton86 isotope this agreement replaced the longstanding standard meter located in paris which was a metal bar made of a platinum iridium alloy the bar was originally estimated to be one tenmillionth of a quadrant of the earth s polar circumference and was itself replaced by a definition based on the speed of light a fundamental physical constant in october 1983 the bureau international des poids et mesures international bureau of weights and measures defined the meter as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1299792458 s
the concentration of krypton in earths atmosphere is about 1 ppm it can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation the amount of krypton in space is uncertain as is the amount is derived from the meteoritic activity and that from solar winds the first measurements suggest an overabundance of krypton in space
like the other noble gases krypton is chemically inert however following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962 synthesis of krypton difluoride was reported in 1963 other fluorides and a salt of a krypton oxoacid have also been found arkr and kr h molecule ions have been investigated and there is evidence for kr xe or krxe
at the university of helsinki in finland hkrcn and hkrcch krypton hydridecyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene were synthesized and determined to be stable up to 40 k m räsänen et al
if the kryptonite found in superman stories followed the naming conventions of chemical compounds it would be an oxyanion of krypton krypton cannot form an oxyanion
there are 31 known isotopes of krypton naturally occurring krypton is made of five stable and one slightly radioactive isotope its spectral signature can be produced with some very sharp lines 81kr the product of atmospheric reactions is produced with the other naturally occurring isotopes of krypton being radioactive it has a halflife of 250000 years krypton is highly volatile when it is near surface waters but 81kr has been used for dating old 50000 800000 year groundwater
sup85supkr is an inert radioactive noble gas with a halflife of 1076 years it is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors 85kr is released during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors concentrations at the north pole are 30 higher than at the south pole as most nuclear reactors are in the northern hemisphere
kryptons multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear white which in turn makes kryptonbased bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source krypton is thus used in some types of photographic flashes used in high speed photography fluorescent light bulbs are filled with a mixture of krypton and argon gases krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenishyellow light
kryptons white discharge is often used to good effect in colored gas discharge tubes which are then simply painted or stained in other ways to allow the desired color for example neon type advertising signs where the letters appear in differing colors are often entirely kryptonbased krypton is also capable of much higher light power density than neon in the red spectral line region and for this reason red lasers for high power laser light shows are krypton lasers with mirrors which select out the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission rather than the more familiar heliumneon variety which could never practically achieve the multiwatt red laser light outputs needed for this application
krypton has an important role in production and usage of the krypton fluoride laser the laser has been important in the nuclear fusion energy research community in confinement experiments the laser has high beam uniformity short wavelength and the ability to modify the spot size to track an imploding pellet
in experimental particle physics liquid krypton is used to construct quasihomogenious electromagnetic calorimeters a notable example is the calorimeter of the na48 experiment at cern containing about 27 tons of liquid krypton this usage is rare since the cheaper liquid argon is typically used the advantage of krypton over agron is a small molière radius of 47cm which allows for excellent spatial resolution and low degree of overlapping the other parameters relevant for calorimetry application are radiation length of cm density of 24gcm
