our great middle class is hardpressed 
millions of americans have lost their jobs and millions more are struggling under the mounting burden of lifes everyday costs 
we have a plan to build a strong growing economy creating good jobs rewarding hard work and restoring fiscal discipline 
and we will honor the values of a strong american community widening the circle of equality protecting the sanctity of freedom and deepening our commitment to this country 
alone among nations america was born in pursuit of an idea that a free people with diverse beliefs could govern themselves in peace 
for more than a century america has spared no effort to defend and promote that idea around the world 
and over and over that effort has been marked by the exercise of american leadership to forge powerful alliances based on mutual respect with longtime allies and reluctant friends with nations already living in the light of democracy and with peoples struggling to join them 
the might of our alliances coupled with the strength of our democratic ideals has been a driving force in the survival and success of freedom in two world wars in the korean war in the cold war in the gulf war and in kosovo 
america led instead of going it alone 
we extended a hand not a fist 
we respected the world and the world respected us 
as americans we respect and honor our veterans 
we are indebted to all those courageous men and women who have answered our countrys call to duty 
their service and sacrifice their dedication and love of country advance our cause of freedom and uphold our finest traditions as a nation 
but the bush administration has walked away from more than a hundred years of american leadership in the world to embrace a new and dangerously ineffective disregard for the world 
they rush to force before exhausting diplomacy 
they bully rather than persuade 
they act alone when they could assemble a team 
they hope for the best when they should prepare for the worst 
time and again this administration confuses leadership with going it alone and engagement with compromise of principle 
they do not understand that real leadership means standing by your principles and rallying others to join you 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a better stronger america an america that is respected not just feared and an america that listens and leads 
our vision has deep roots in our declaration of independence and franklin delano roosevelts four freedoms 
and in the toughminded tradition of engagement and leadershipa tradition forged by wilson and roosevelt in two world wars then championed by truman and kennedy during the cold war 
we believe in an america that people around the world admire because they know we cherish not just our freedom but theirs 
not just our democracy but their hope for it 
not just our peace and security but the worlds 
we believe in an america that cherishes freedom safeguards our people forges alliances and commands respect 
our overriding goals are the same as ever to protect our people and our way of life 
and to help build a safer more peaceful 
more prosperous 
more democratic world 
today we face three great challenges above all others first to win the global war against terror 
second to stop the spread of nuclear biological and chemical weapons 
and third to promote democracy and freedom around the world starting with a peaceful and stable iraq 
to meet these challenges we need a new national security policy guided by four new imperatives 
first america must launch and lead a new era of alliances for the postseptember world 
second we must modernize the worlds most powerful military to meet the new threats 
third in addition to our military might we must deploy all that is in americas arsenal 
our diplomacy 
our intelligence system 
our economic power 
and the appeal of our values and ideas 
fourth and finally to safeguard our freedom and ensure our nations future we must end our dependence on mideast oil 
today the bush administration is waging a war against a global terrorist movement committed to our destruction with insufficient understanding of our enemy or effort to address the underlying factors that can give rise to new recruits 
this war isnt just a manhunt 
we can not rest until osama bin laden is captured or killed but that day will mark only a victory in the war on terror not its end 
terrorists like al qaeda and its affiliates are unlike any adversary our nation has ever known 
we face a global terrorist movement of many groups funded from different sources with separate agendas but all committed to assaulting the united states and free and open societies around the globe 
despite his tough talk president bushs actions against terrorism have fallen far short 
he still has no comprehensive strategy for victory 
after allowing bin laden to escape from our grasp at tora bora he diverted crucial resources from the effort to destroy al qaeda in afghanistan 
his doctrine of unilateral preemption has driven away our allies and cost us the support of other nations 
we must put in place a strategy to win an approach that recognizes and addresses the many facets of this mortal challenge from the terrorists themselves to the root causes that give rise to new recruits and uses all the tools at our disposal 
agents of terrorism work in the shadows of more than nations on every continent 
the only possible path to victory will be found in the company of others not walking alone 
with john kerry as commanderinchief we will never wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake 
but we must enlist those whose support we need for ultimate victory 
victory in the war on terror requires a combination of american determination and international cooperation on all fronts 
it requires the ability and willingness to direct immediate effective military action when the capture or destruction of terrorist groups and their leaders is possible 
a massive improvement in intelligence gathering and analysis coupled with vigorous law enforcement 
a relentless effort to shut down the flow of terrorist funds 
a global effort to prevent failed or failing states that can become sanctuaries for terrorists 
a sustained effort to deny terrorists any more recruits by conducting effective public diplomacy 
and a sustained political and economic effort to improve education 
work for peace 
support democracy and extend hope 
we will train and equip the military to enhance its capabilities to seek out and destroy terrorists 
we will strengthen the capacity of intelligence and law enforcement around the world by forging stronger international coalitions to provide better information and communication 
we must also improve our intelligence here at home 
from the failure to uncover the september th plot to the deeply misguided reports about iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction we have experienced unprecedented intelligence failures in recent years 
we must do what president bush has refused to do reform our intelligence system by creating a true director of national intelligence with real control of intelligence personnel and budgets 
we must train more analysts in languages spoken by terrorists 
and we must break down the old communications barriers between national intelligence and local law enforcement taking care to fully preserve our liberties 
we will move decisively to cut off the flow of terrorist funds 
we will impose tough financial sanctions against nations or banks that engage in money laundering or fail to act against it 
we will strengthen our antimoney laundering laws to prevent terrorists from using hedge funds and unregulated institutions to finance terror 
we will launch a name and shame campaign against those that are financing terror 
if nations do not respond they will be shut out of the us financial system 
and in the specific case of saudi arabia we will put an end to the bush administrations kidglove approach to the supply and laundering of terrorist money 
nowhere is the need for collective endeavor greater than in afghanistan 
the bush administration has badly mishandled the wars aftermath 
two years ago president bush promised a marshall plan to rebuild that country 
instead he has all but turned away from afghanistan allowing it to become again a potential haven for terrorists 
we must expand nato forces outside kabul 
we must accelerate training for the afghan army and police 
the program to disarm and reintegrate warlord militias into society must be expedited and expanded into a mainstream strategy 
we will attack the exploding opium trade ignored by the bush administration by doubling our counternarcotics assistance to the karzai government and reinvigorating the regional drug control program 
beyond afghanistan terrorist attacks from saudi arabia and indonesia to kenya morocco and turkey point to a widening network of terrorists targeting this country and our friends 
failed and failing states like somalia or countries with large areas of limited government control like the philippines and indonesia need international help to close down terrorist havens 
at the core of this conflict is a fundamental struggle of ideas democracy and tolerance against those who would use any means and attack any target to impose their narrow views 
the war on terror is not a clash of civilizations 
it is a clash of civilization against chaos 
america needs a major initiative in public diplomacy to support the many voices of freedom in the arab and muslim world 
to improve education for the next generation of islamic youth we need a cooperative international effort to compete with radical madrassas 
and we must support human rights groups 
independent media 
and labor unions dedicated to building a democratic culture from the grassroots up 
democracy will not blossom overnight but america should speed its growth by sustaining the forces of democracy against repressive regimes and by rewarding governments that work toward this end 
there is no greater threat to american security than the possibility of terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction 
preventing terrorists from gaining access to these weapons must be our number one security goal 
containing this massive threat requires american leadership of the highest order 
leadership that brings our allies friends and partners to greater collaboration and participation 
and compels problem states to join and comply with international agreements and abandon their weapons programs 
unfortunately this administrations policies have moved america in the opposite direction 
they have weakened international agreements and efforts to enforce nonproliferation instead of strengthening them 
they have not done nearly enough to secure existing stockpiles and bombmaking materials 
they have failed to take effective steps to stop the north korean and iranian nuclear programs 
we must change course now 
first the world should be on notice that we will take every possible measure to defend ourselves against the possibility of attack by unconventional arms 
if such an attack appears imminent we will do everything necessary to stop it 
if such a strike does occur we will respond with overwhelming and devastating force 
but we should never wait to act until we have no other choice but war 
we must build and lead an international consensus for early preventive action to lock up and secure existing weapons of mass destruction and the material to manufacture more 
the first step is to safeguard all bomb making material worldwide 
we need to find it catalog it and lock it away 
our approach should be simple treat the nuclear materials that make bombs like they are bombs 
more than a decade after the fall of the berlin wall russia still has nearly nuclear weapons and enough nuclear material to produce more 
for most of these weapons and materials cooperative security upgrades have not been completed 
the world is relying on whatever measures russia has taken on its own 
at the current pace it will take years to secure potential bomb material in the former soviet union 
we can not wait that long 
we will do it in four years 
we will lead an international coalition to put an end to the production of new materials highly enriched uranium and plutonium for use in nuclear weapons 
and we will reduce excess stocks of existing nuclear materials and weapons 
we will conduct a global cleanout initiative to remove stockpiles of vulnerable highly enriched uranium at research reactors and facilities in dozens of countries around the world within four years 
we must show determined leadership to end the nuclear weapons program in north korea and prevent the development of nuclear weapons in places like iran 
north korea has sold ballistic missiles and technology in the past 
the north koreans have made it clear to the world and to the terrorists that they are open for business and will sell to the highest bidder 
but while this administration has been fixated on iraq the nuclear dangers from north korea have multiplied 
the north koreans allegedly have made enough new fuel to make six to nine nuclear bombs 
we should maintain the sixparty talks but we must also be prepared to talk directly with north korea to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that addresses the full range of issues for ourselves and our allies 
but we should have no illusions about kim jong il 
any agreement must have rigorous verification and lead to complete and irreversible elimination of north koreas nuclear weapons program 
even as we have scoured iraq for signs of weapons of mass destruction iran has reportedly been working to develop them next door 
a nucleararmed iran is an unacceptable risk to us and our allies 
the same is true for other countries that may be seeking nuclear weapons 
this is why strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is so critical 
we must close the loophole that lets countries develop nuclear weapons capabilities under the guise of a peaceful civilian nuclear power program 
we also need to strengthen enforcement and verification and make rigorous inspection protocols mandatory 
we must work with every country to tighten export controls 
stiffen penalties 
and beef up law enforcement and intelligence sharing 
that way we can make absolutely sure that a disaster like the aq khan black market network which grew out of pakistans nuclear program can never happen again 
we must also take steps to reduce tension between india and pakistan and guard against the possibility of their nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands 
we know that promoting democracy 
human rights 
and the rule of law is vital to our longterm security 
americans will be safer in a world of democracies 
we will work with people and nongovernmental organizations around the world struggling for freedom 
even as we work with their governments to protect our security from weapons of terror 
we will restore americas credibility and commitment as a force for democracy 
and human rights starting in iraq 
we believe that upholding international standards for the treatment of prisoners wherever they may be held advances americas national security the security of our troops and the values of our people 
and we believe torture is unacceptable 
america should abide by its own laws and the treaties it has ratified including the geneva conventions 
we will also support international efforts to address the problem of landmines 
while at the same time ensuring that our troops are protected 
more than a year ago president bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished 
but today we know that the mission is not finished hostilities have not ended and our men and women in uniform fight almost alone with the target squarely on their backs 
people of good will disagree about whether america should have gone to war in iraq but this much is clear this administration badly exaggerated its case particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction and the connection between saddams government and al qaeda 
this administration did not build a true international coalition 
this administration disdained the united nations weapons inspection process and rushed to war without exhausting diplomatic alternatives 
ignoring the advice of military leaders this administration did not send sufficient forces into iraq to accomplish the mission 
and this administration went into iraq without a plan to win the peace 
now this administration has been forced to change course in order to correct this fundamental mistake 
they are now taking up the suggestions that many democrats have been making for over a year 
and they must because having gone to war we can not afford to fail at peace 
we can not allow a failed state in iraq that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a destabilizing force in the middle east 
and we must secure more help from an international community that shares a huge stake in helping iraq become a responsible member of that community not a breeding ground for terror and intolerance 
as a first step we must create a stable and secure environment in iraq 
to do this right we must truly internationalize both politically and militarily we can not depend on a usonly presence 
other nations have a vital interest in the outcome and we must bring them in to commit troops and resources 
the bush administration has missed three great opportunities to do that 
first the president broke his promise to build a legitimate coalition in iraq by exhausting diplomacy before resorting to the use of military force 
second when the statue fell in baghdad kofi annan invited the united states to come to the table to discuss international support but we rejected his offer 
third when the president addressed the united nations last fall he once again refused to acknowledge the difficulties we faced in iraq and failed to elicit support from other nations 
the president has not given our troops the clarity of mission the equipment or the international support they need and deserve 
we have a different approach based on a simple commitment troops come first 
our helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best antimissile systems 
in a democratic administration that will change 
too many of our nations finest troops have died in attacks because tens of thousands were deployed to iraq without the best bulletproof vests and there is a shortage of armored vehicles on the ground 
in a democratic administration that will change 
thousands of national guardsmen and reservists have been forced to leave their families and jobs for more than a year with no end in sight because this administration ignored the pressing need for a true coalition 
in a democratic administration that will change 
to succeed america must do the hard work of engaging the worlds major political powers in this mission 
we must build a coalition of countries including the other permanent members of the un security council to share the political economic and military responsibilities of iraq with the united states 
to win over allies we must share responsibility with those nations that answer our call and treat them with respect 
we must lead but we must listen 
the rewards of respect are enormous 
we must convince nato to take on a more significant role and contribute additional military forces 
as other countries including muslim majority countries contribute troops the united states will be able to reduce its military presence in iraq and we intend to do this when appropriate so that the military support needed by a sovereign iraqi government will no longer be seen as the direct continuation of an american military presence 
second we need to create an international high commissioner to serve as the senior international representative working with the iraqi government 
this commissioner should be backed by a newly broadened security coalition and charged with overseeing elections assisting with drafting a constitution and coordinating reconstruction 
the commissioner should be highly regarded by the international community have the credibility to talk to all the iraqi people and work directly with iraqs interim government the new us ambassador and the international community 
at the same time us and international policies must take into consideration the best interests of the iraqi people 
the iraqi people desperately need financial and technical assistance that is not swallowed up by bureaucracy and nobid contracts but instead goes directly into grassroots organizations 
they need to see the tangible benefits of reconstruction jobs infrastructure and services 
they should also receive the full benefits of their own oil production as quickly as possible so as to rebuild their country and help themselves as individuals 
while also reducing the costs of security and reconstruction on the american taxpayer and the cost of gasoline to american consumers 
and they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international authorities without feeling they are being disrespected in their own country 
america also needs a massive training effort to build iraqi security forces that can actually provide security for the iraqi people 
it must be done in the field and on the job as well as in the classroom 
units can not be put on the street without backup from international security forces 
this is a task we must do in partnership with other nations not just on our own 
and this is a task in which we must succeed 
if we fail to create viable iraqi security forces military and police there is no successful exit for us and other nations 
the challenges in iraq are great but the opportunity is also significant 
under john kerry and john edwards we will meet those challenges win the peace in iraq and help to create new hope and opportunity for the entire middle east 
us engagement in africa should reflect its vital significance to us interests and the moral imperative to help a continent struggling with the scourge of hivaids and under the long shadow of chronic poverty 
the hivaids pandemic in southern and eastern africa is a massive human tragedy 
it is also a security risk of the highest order that threatens to plunge nations into chaos 
chronic and debilitating hunger also threatens the very survival of communities where investment in agriculture has suffered for over a decade 
we are committed to bringing the full weight of american leadership to bear against this crisis 
we must also work with the united nations and africas regional organizations to address africas persistent disproportionate share of the worlds weak failing states and chronic armed conflicts and to promote effective relief efforts when there is a humanitarian crisis particularly at this moment in sudan 
we value our deepening economic ties with africa including central and west africas rapidly rising position as a major source of nongulf oil 
we recognize africas promise as a trade and investment partner and the importance of trade policies that reduce poverty and promote growth in africa 
we will continue to promote policies to support newly democratic states that have shown a commitment to economic reform and respect for human rights 
in asia we must better engage with china to secure chinese adherence to international trade nonproliferation and human rights standards 
we are committed to a one china policy and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of crossstraits issues that is consistent with the wishes and best interests of the taiwanese people 
we must maintain our strong relationship with japan and explore new ways to cooperate further 
and we will actively seek to enhance relations with our historic ally south korea in order to advance our collaborative efforts on economic and security issues 
we must also work with our friends india and pakistan in their efforts to resolve longstanding differences 
throughout the th century americas most trusted and reliable allies were the democracies of europe together the two sides of the atlantic ensured that democracy and free markets prevailed against all challenges 
the bush administration has allowed the atlantic partnership to erode leaving the united states dangerously isolated from its indispensable allies 
the democratic party is committed to revitalizing the atlantic partnership 
the international goals that the united states pursues will be easier to attain if europe and america are working together 
we will ensure that nato remains strong continuing to consolidate peace in europe even as the alliance takes on new tasks in afghanistan and iraq 
we look forward to the evolution of the european union and to a prosperous and unified europe that joins the united states in meeting todays security challenges and expanding the global economy 
we believe that it is time to create a new community of the americas that reflects our close relationship with our regional neighbors 
we will return us latin american relations to a place marked by dialogue consensus and concerted action to address common concerns 
we understand that our collective security and prosperity are furthered by mutual efforts to promote democracy generate wealth reduce income disparities and provide sound environmental stewardship 
we are committed to strong and steady support for democratic processes and institutions in our hemisphere 
we believe that democratic governments deserve our support and that we should exercise our considerable diplomatic and moral force in support of democratically elected leaders 
mexico has made steady progress toward building a mature democracy and we will make relations with mexico a priority in order to best address economic environmental and social issues of concern 
we support effective and peaceful strategies to end the castro regime as soon as possible and enable the cuban people to take their rightful place in the democratic community of the americas 
we will work with the international community to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the castro regime to release all political prisoners support civil society promote the important work of cuban dissidents and begin a process of genuine political reform 
within this framework the democratic party supports a policy of principled travel to cuba that promotes family unity and peopletopeople contacts through educational and cultural exchanges 
we will seek to reinforce democratic values in haiti and throughout the caribbean 
we will support economic development to increase employment and economic opportunity reducing incentives for emigration by dangerous and lifethreatening means 
we will increase efforts to combat drugtrafficking throughout the caribbean and ensure that those involved in bringing drugs into the us are brought to justice 
we will assist in combating corruption so that funds made available for development are used appropriately 
the democratic party is fundamentally committed to the security of our ally israel 
and the creation of a comprehensive just and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors 
our special relationship with israel is based on the unshakable foundation of shared values and a mutual commitment to democracy and we will ensure that under all circumstances israel retains the qualitative edge for its national security and its right to selfdefense 
jerusalem is the capital of israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths 
under a democratic administration the united states will demonstrate the kind of resolve to end the israelipalestinian conflict that president clinton showed 
we will work to transform the palestinian authority by promoting new and responsible leadership committed to fighting terror and promoting democracy 
we support the creation of a democratic palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the jewish state of israel 
the creation of a palestinian state should resolve the issue of palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there rather than in israel 
furthermore all understand that it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 
and we understand that all final status negotiations must be mutually agreed 
we are determined to help create a lasting peace in northern ireland 
we support efforts by the irish and british governments and the political parties to break the current impasse and we stand ready to assist in any way to achieve full implementation of the belfast agreement 
democrats will pursue a russia policy that recognizes that countrys importance and 
advances the core us security interests at stake in russias historic transformation beginning with cooperative work to secure vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials 
we reiterate that respect for human rights the rule of law and russias fledgling democratic institutions and independent media outlets are essential to russias continued integration into international institutions and the global economy 
addressing global health challenges including the aids pandemic is a humanitarian obligation and a national security imperative 
we are committed to a coordinated effort to combat the hivaids epidemic in the united states and in all other regions throughout the world 
epidemics can decimate societies and contribute to failed states which can become bases for terrorists and other criminal elements 
and a strong global public health system is essential to effectively combating bioterror threats 
our global health policy will bring the best of our scientific knowledge financial resources management skills and compassion to the challenge of improving health conditions around the world 
and we will restore americas leadership in global health by rejecting policies driven by ideology instead of science 
we understand that promoting international economic development is a strategic imperative of the united states 
we will use american economic power to extend security and prosperity which leads to peace around the world 
and we will work with poor countries to help stabilize and diversify their economies including through the consideration of sensible debt relief measures where appropriate 
we will support efforts to reach universal basic education and the other millennium development goals 
we are committed to the best training facilities and support for americas diplomats the men and women of americas foreign affairs community who represent our country and work to promote our values around the world 
we need a new military to meet the new threats of the st century 
todays american military is the best in the world but tomorrows military must be even better 
it must be stronger faster better armed and never again stretched so thin 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party will send a clear message to every man and woman in our armed forces we guarantee that you will always be the bestled bestequipped and most respected fighting force in the world 
you will be armed with the right weapons schooled in the right skills and fully prepared to win on the battlefield 
you will never be sent into harms way without enough troops for the task and never asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace 
you will never be given assignments which have not been clearly defined and for which you are not professionally trained 
the bush administration was right to call for the transformation of the military 
but their version of transformation neglected to consider that the dangers we face have also been transformed 
the administration was concerned with fighting classic conventional wars instead of the asymmetrical threats we now face in iraq afghanistan and the war against al qaeda 
to rise to those challenges we must strengthen our military including our special forces improve our technology and task our national guard with homeland security 
as a first step we will expand americas active duty forces 
the war in iraq has overextended our armed services 
the vast majority of the armys active duty combat divisions are committed to iraqcurrently there preparing to go or recently returned 
that is a dangerous and potentially disastrous strain that limits our capacity to respond to other crises 
to pick up the slack weve called up our guard and reserves at historic levels 
some have been on the ground in iraq for as many as months much longer than was expected or promised 
many of these units are being pushed to the limit and stretched far too thin 
the administrations answer has just been to stretch further 
they have extended tours of duty delayed retirements and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service effectively using a stoploss policy and recall of individual ready reserve members as a backdoor draft 
we will add new soldiers not to increase the number of soldiers in iraq but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts 
this will help relieve the strain on our troops and bring back more of our soldiers guardsmen and reservists 
we are dedicated to keeping our military operating on a volunteer basis 
we are committed to management reform both to ensure that our defense funding is spent effectively and to help pay for these new forces 
doubling special forces capability 
next we need to create a new total force a military prepared to defeat any enemy at any time in any place 
we will double the capacity of our special forces the troops who took the fight to the taliban with remarkable creativity after september th 
these troops conduct counterterrorism operations perform reconnaissance missions and gather intelligence 
they also train local forces and build the relationships that are vital for our victory in the war on terror 
we will increase our civil affairs personnel those who arrive on the scene after the major conflict ends to work with local leaders and officials to get the schools back in shape the hospitals reopened and the banks up and running 
we also need more military police because public order is critical to establishing the conditions that allow peace to take hold 
third we need the best possible equipment 
we cant have a st century military unless were using st century technology and preparing our forces for st century threats 
that means educating training and arming every soldier with stateoftheart equipment whether body armor or weapons 
it also means employing the most sophisticated communications to help our troops prevail and protect themselves in battle 
every soldier in every unit should have access to technology that can mean the difference between life and death 
we will make sure every solider does 
and we will build and train new forces equipped with the mostsophisticated technology to specialize in finding securing and destroying weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that build them 
fourth we must match our commitment to innovation with a commitment to the training education and facilities necessary to make the most of it 
fifth we will make sure that americas commitment to the men and women of our armed forces our active duty our reservists and our national guard and their families is ironclad 
we will enact a military family bill of rights to ensure that our men and women in uniform and their families receive the benefits and respect they deserve competitive pay and quality housing decent health care and dental care quality education for their children and timely deployment information 
and we will ensure that america will care for them and their families if the worst should happen 
finally we need to make better use of a key asset in homeland defense our national guard 
the national guard has served in every war and theyre serving now 
they were the first ones called to line city streets guard bridges and patrol our airports after september th 
we will make homeland security one of the guards primary missions and assign guard units to a standing joint task force commanded by a general from the guard 
no strategy for american security is complete without a plan to end americas dependence on mideast oil 
today the american economy depends on oil controlled by some of the worlds most repressive regimes 
this leaves our economy dangerously vulnerable to nations that do not share our interests 
america too often is silent about the practices of some governments because we depend on oil they control 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe a strong america must no longer rely on the cooperation of regimes that do not share our values 
we believe a strong america must move toward energy independence 
in the bush administration energy independence doesnt get a thought 
their energy policy is simple government by big oil of big oil and for big oil 
this administration let oil industry lobbyists and executives write our nations energy policy in secret 
they even went to the supreme court to stop the public from learning what they were doing 
theyve done nothing as gas prices have soared to record levels 
even the administrations own economists have found that their energy plan will do nothing to reduce gas prices 
this presidents approach to energy policy leaves america shackled to foreign oil dependent vulnerable and exposed 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a better stronger more independent america 
we are committed to achieving energy independence and we know we can do it 
our ingenuity and determination built the cars we drive and the bridges we use 
it electrified rural america in the s and took us to the moon in the s 
our resolve helped conquer polio 
its this simple when we see a problem we roll up our sleeves and solve it 
and thats what we pledge to do now 
achieving energy independence will improve our ability to protect our values and interests in the world 
it will reduce energy costs for our families 
it will create highpaying new jobs 
and it will improve our environment and make our people healthier 
our plan begins with commonsense investments to harness the natural world around usthe sun wind water geothermal and biomass sources and a rich array of cropsto create a new generation of affordable energy for the st century 
by mobilizing the amazing productivity of americas farmers we can grow our own cleanerburning fuel 
we support tax credits for private sector investment in clean renewable sources of energy and we will make ethanol credits work better for farmers 
and we will ensure that billions of gallons of renewable fuel are part of americas energy supply while striving for strong national renewable energy goals 
we support creating more energyefficient vehicles from todays hybrid cars to tomorrows hydrogen cars 
we support the american peoples freedom to choose whatever cars suvs minivans and trucks they choose but we also believe american ingenuity is equal to the task of improving efficiency 
we support improving fuel standards and because of the challenges this poses we will offer needed incentives for consumers to buy efficient vehicles and for manufacturers to build them 
we are also committed to developing hydrogen as a clean reliable domestic source of energy 
our economy can not convert to hydrogen overnight so we will fund research to overcome the obstacles to hydrogen fuel and continue our other efforts to achieve energy independence 
we can improve our energy security in other ways 
we will seek more diverse sources of oil around the world and here at home 
we support balanced development of domestic oil supplies in areas already open for exploration like the western and central gulf of mexico 
we support the expansion of new infrastructure to develop supplies from nonopec nations like russia canada and nations in africa 
we will increase efficiency of natural gas use develop the alaska natural gas pipeline and enhance our nations infrastructure to help supply natural gas more effectively 
we will work to create new technology for producing electricity in a better more efficient manner 
coal accounts for more than onehalf of americas electric power generation capacity today 
we believe coal must continue its important role in a new energy economy while achieving high environmental standards 
working with the coal industry we will invest billions to develop and implement new cleaner coal technology and to produce electric and hydrogen power 
we will also work to make sure that our people have access to an affordable secure and reliable supply of electricity at all times 
we support mandatory enforceable reliability standards 
we also support publicprivate partnerships to make our power systems more flexible resilient and selfhealing 
and more environmentally friendly than ever before 
the federal government is the largest single consumer of energy in the world 
we will cut the federal governments energy use and challenge local governments corporations universities small businesses and hospitals to do the same 
a balanced energy policy must create real incentives for energy conservation in our homes our offices our factories and our infrastructure saving money and improving security even as it creates good jobs and rebuilds our communities 
with sixtyfive percent of the worlds oil reserves in the middle east we can not drill our way to energy independence 
but we can create think imagine and invent our way there 
and we will create jobs help our environment and build a stronger country as we do 
the first and foremost responsibility of government is to protect its citizens from harm 
unfortunately washington today is not doing enough to make america safe 
we have made some progress since the terrible attacks of september th 
we have taken steps to secure our airports 
after resisting democratic efforts for months the administration finally agreed to create the department of homeland security 
but we have not done nearly enough 
our intelligence services remain fragmented and lack coordination 
millions of massive shipping containers arrive at american ports every year without being searched and without even a reliable list of their contents 
our borders are full of holes 
our chemical plants are vulnerable to attack 
across america police officers firefighters and other first responders still lack the information protective gear and communications equipment to do their jobs safely and successfully 
the bush administration full of tough talk about terror has no coherent plan for domestic defense 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe america can do better 
we believe america must do better 
we believe america will do better 
we need a new strategy for homeland security that addresses five major challenges 
we need to improve our ability to gather analyze and share information so we can track down terrorists and stop them before they cause harm 
we need to do a better job securing our airports seaports and borders 
we need to harden likely terrorist targets 
we need to improve domestic readiness 
finally we must win the war on terror without losing the values of freedom and justice for all that make us so proud to be americans 
the war on terror begins with good intelligence 
shockingly many of the same flaws in intelligencesharing that allowed terrorists to slip in and out of america before september th still exist 
the government has missed its own deadlines for upgrading and integrating security databases and still fails to share information with the state and local law enforcement agencies on the frontlines 
this must change 
we will ensure that our watch lists are accessible when and where they are needed 
we will also give security clearances to appropriate state and local officials so they can get critical information at the critical times 
our intelligence apparatus needs significant reform and so creating a true director of national intelligence is critical 
we will improve security at our borders and entrypoints to block the individuals and weapons that would harm us 
we will strengthen container security rules improve the detection equipment in our shipping systems ensure that private companies are providing adequate information about the goods they are shipping and work with other nations to increase inspection levels abroad 
we will put an end to political delays in adopting tighter controls on air cargo tons of which goes uninspected every day 
we will increase perimeter inspections at us airports and work with international aviation authorities to make sure the same standards are in place overseas 
working with our northern and southern neighbors we will strengthen controls at border crossings and use modern technology and better staffing to improve the quality of border inspections while enhancing commerce 
we will launch a major effort to harden our most vulnerable targets from chemical and nuclear plants to rails and tunnels and better protect them from attack 
security upgrades at some nuclear weapons facilities are a shocking three years behind 
that is unacceptable and we will fix it 
we must better protect nuclear facilities and waste sites which today are too vulnerable to attack 
we will improve transit rail and subway security by adding chemical release detectors to deter attacks like we saw in tokyo and taking other steps 
there are more than chemical plants where an attack could endanger more than one million people and the fbi has warned that al qaeda may target our chemical industry 
the bush administration was actually moving toward a commonsense solution that would set minimum standards for safety at chemical plants 
but dangerously true to form after heavy lobbying by the chemical industry they backed down 
we will make these plants secure by requiring more guards more fencing and the use of less dangerous chemicals when possible 
we need to improve domestic readiness so people on the frontlines have the training and equipment to respond to any attack with all the speed skill and strength required 
our first responders are the first ones up the stairs in the event of the emergency and it is wrong that today they are last in line when it comes to this administrations budgets 
under the bush administration police departments in small cities have lost more than percent of their fulltime paid police and employees 
and today twothirds of our nations fire departments are not fully staffed 
we can do more for the heroes of and we can do more for our fellow citizens 
and we will 
we will provide direct assistance to our police officers and firefighters on the frontlines 
theyll have the equipment and manpower they need to protect us 
we will also ensure that front line workers throughout our transportation system receive the security training necessary to respond to terrorist threats 
we also need to modernize our emergency warning system to provide localized warnings treat the fighters on the frontlines as partners and give families all the information they need 
this administration may think that homeland security is about changing the alert from yellow to orange 
theyre wrong the colors of safety are firefighter red emt white and police officer blue 
we will dramatically improve our ability to respond to a biological attack 
we will appoint one individual to oversee all bioterrorism programs budgets and strategic priorities 
we will set national benchmarks for state and local preparedness so community leaders arent flying blind 
we will harness americas bioscience genius to increase drug and vaccine development 
we will revitalize our public health system improving monitoring capabilities and coordination 
and we will strengthen hospitals which today can not prepare for a bioterrorism emergency because they are overwhelmed by the everyday emergencies of people without insurance 
we also will encourage all americans to do their part to make america safer 
we support the development of a new community defense service grounded in neighborhoods and comprised of ordinary americans from across the country 
like a st century neighborhood watch members would work within their communities to make a contributionhelping health professionals assisting with evacuation plans and standing ready in emergency 
while terrorism poses an especially menacing threat to our nation a strong america must remain vigilant against the scourge of homegrown crime as well 
we are proud that democrats led the fight to put more than cops on the beat through the cops program and we will continue our steadfast support for cops and community policing 
to keep our streets safe for our families we support tough punishment of violent crime and smart efforts to reintegrate former prisoners into our communities as productive citizens 
we will crack down on the gang violence and drug crime that devastate so many communities and we will increase drug treatment including mandatory drug courts and mandatory drug testing for parolees and probationers so fewer crimes are committed in the first place 
we support the rights of victims to be respected to be heard and to be compensated 
we will help break the cycle of domestic violence by punishing offenders and standing with victims 
we will protect americans second amendment right to own firearms and we will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists by fighting gun crime reauthorizing the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole as president bush proposed and failed to do 
we must always remember that terrorists do not just target our lives they target our way of life 
and so we must be on constant guard not to sacrifice the freedom we are fighting to protect 
we will strengthen some provisions of the patriot act like the restrictions on money laundering 
and we will change the portions of the patriot act that threaten individual rights such as the library provisions while still allowing government to take all needed steps to fight terror 
our government should never round up innocent people only because of their religion or ethnicity and we should never stifle free expression 
we believe in an america where freedom is what we fight for not what we give up 
together we can make america safer stronger and more respected 
we can do it in a way that safeguards all the greatness of america by protecting our people securing our homeland and reinforcing our values 
faith and family duty and service individual freedom 
and a common purpose to build one nation under god 
we can do it in a way that keeps faith with the best measures of american leadership around the world the builder of alliances the defender of freedom the champion of human rights 
we can do it and we will 
we offer america a new economic plan that will put jobs first 
we will renew american competitiveness make honest budget choices and invest in our future 
a strong america keeps the promise of opportunity for all and heeds the warning of special privileges for none 
thats the america we believe in 
thats the america were fighting for 
and thats the america we can build together 
in president george bushs america unfortunately too often you need special privileges if you want opportunity 
this white house values wealth over hard work lavishes special treatment upon a fortunate few at the expense of most businesses and working people and defends policies that weaken americas competitive position and destroy american jobs 
instead of meeting the challenge of globalization by strengthening our workers ability to compete and win this administration uses globalization as an excuse not to fight for american jobs 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a better americaa strong america 
we believe that a strong america begins at home with good jobs that support families and an equal chance for all our people 
we believe in progress that brings prosperity for all americans not just for those who are already successful 
we believe that good jobs will help strengthen and expand the strongest middle class the world has ever known 
we believe the private sector not government is the engine of economic growth and job creation 
governments responsibility is to create an environment that will promote private sector investment foster vigorous competition and strengthen the foundations of an innovative economy 
we believe americans are the smartest toughest competitors in the world 
our products and ideas can compete and win anywhere as long as were given a fair chance 
and our companies can keep and create jobs in america without sacrificing competitiveness 
we will fight for american jobs and we will fight for american workers 
under john kerry and john edwards we will revive americas manufacturing sector create new jobs and protect existing ones by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and cutting taxes for companies that create jobs here at home by fighting for free fair and balanced trade by encouraging investment in small businesses and helping companies deal with rising health care costs 
by promoting new technologies like energy that will lead to the companies and jobs of tomorrow 
and by ensuring that people of every age learn the skills to succeed in todays economy 
todays tax law provides big breaks for companies that send american jobs overseas 
current deferral policies allow american companies to avoid paying american taxes on the income earned by their foreign subsidiaries 
john kerry and john edwards will end deferral that encourages companies to ship jobs overseas and they will close other loopholes to make the tax code work for the american worker 
theyll use the savings to offer tax cuts for companies that produce goods and create jobs here at home 
under john kerry and john edwards percent of american businesses will pay lower taxes than today 
manufacturing has lost million jobs under president bush in its worst jobs crisis since the depression 
john kerry john edwards and the democrats will launch a concerted effort to revitalize american manufacturing 
the measures outlined above are important components of our overall strategy 
in addition based on the model that has helped launch some of americas most successful companies we will establish new investment corporations to give small and mediumsized businesses access to capital 
and we will support the growth of hightechnology clusters that invest in new industries around research institutions 
exports sustain about in american factory jobs 
open markets spur innovation speed the growth of new industries and make our businesses more competitive 
we will make it a priority to knock down barriers to free fair and balanced trade so other nations markets are as open as our own 
we will stand up for american workers and consumers by building on president clintons progress in including enforceable internationally recognized labor and environmental standards in trade agreements 
we will aggressively enforce our trade agreements with a real plan that includes a complete review of all existing agreements 
immediate investigation into chinas workers rights abuses and currency manipulation 
increased funding for efforts to protect workers rights and stop child labor abuse 
new reforms to protect the innovations of hightech companies and vigorous enforcement of u s trade laws 
we will use all the tools we have to create new opportunities for american workers farmers and businesses and break down barriers in key export markets like the japanese auto market and the chinese hightechnology market 
we will effectively enforce our trade laws protecting against dumping illegal subsidies and import surges that threaten american jobs 
new trade agreements must protect internationally recognized workers rights 
and environmental standards as vigorously as they now protect commercial concerns 
we will build on and strengthen the progress made in the jordan agreement to include strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards in the core of new free trade agreements 
and no trade agreement should stop government from protecting the environment food safety or the health of its citizens 
nor should an agreement give greater rights to foreign investors than to us investors require the privatization of our vital public services or limit our governments ability to create good jobs in our communities 
we will invest in the technologies of the future from renewable energy to nanotechnology to biomedicine and will work to make permanent the research and development tax credit 
we will achieve universal access to broadband services which could add billion to our economy generate million jobs and transform the way we learn and work 
and we will put science ahead of ideology in research and policymaking 
our nations transportation network is an integral part of our economy and an engine for economic expansion that must be strengthened 
we are committed to vigorous federal highway and transit initiatives that put americans to work relieve traffic congestion and foster longterm projects at state and local levels 
economic growth and job creation depend on free markets and competition but competition and free markets depend on trust transparency and integrity 
we are committed to requiring honesty in corporate accounting effective corporate governance a fair shake for small investors and worker pension funds a level playing field and competitive bidding practices for those who wish to transact business with the government and vigorous prosecution of criminal conduct in executive suites 
small businesses and entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of our economy 
we will encourage small business growth with a plan to make it easier for small businesses to secure capital and loans 
we support tax credits and energy investments that slash overall operating costs for small businesses and encourage them to grow and expand here in america 
for americas small manufacturers which account for over half the total value of us industrial production and employ million people in highskill highwage jobs we will double funding to use technology to grow 
we will help businesses cope with the skyrocketing cost of health care by reforming our health care system and cutting taxes to help small businesses pay for health insurance 
retiree health costs impose major burdens on many employers particularly manufacturers and we will push for reform so that companies are not forced to choose among retirees current workers and their own ability to compete 
when states are the thrust into a fiscal crisis due to a national economic downturn we should support federal fiscal relief to states as an effective tool to jumpstart growth and job creation and to prevent harmful tuition and tax increases as well as painful cuts to vital education health homeland security and other critical services and to prevent underfunded mandates 
we will ensure that the right to organize a union exists in the real world not just on paper because thats how we create more jobs that can support families 
that means reforming our labor laws to protect the rights of workers including public employees to bargain contracts and organize on a level playing field without interference 
it also means barring the permanent replacement of legal strikers 
and we will of course reverse this administrations cuts in wages for working people by restoring overtime protections for hardworking americans 
we will strengthen health and safety protections as well 
we will make sure that americans are the bestskilled besttrained workers in the world 
in addition to reforming k education we will expand training and opportunities for americans of all ages 
we will support regional skills alliances workforce development conducted at community colleges and other initiatives that prepare workers for highskills jobs that offer familysustaining wages and benefits 
and we will support highquality distance learning so that americans everywhere can use a keyboard to learn from experts anywhere 
unlike the bush administration we will always stand by workers who lose their jobs as the economy changes 
we will require companies to give employees at least three months notice before a planned shutdown 
we will expand efforts to help manufacturers workers the longterm unemployed and communities hurt by imports including extending trade adjustment assistance to workers in the service sectors and making health insurance more affordable for workers who lose their jobs due to trade 
through our jobs plan we will bring hope and jobs back to the cities and small towns devastated by the shuttering of factories 
the heart of the american promise has always been the middle class the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever known 
when the middle class grows in size and security our country gets stronger 
and when more american families save and invest in their childrens future america grows stronger still 
but in president george bushs america where everyday costs are soaring and ordinary incomes are sinking the middle class is struggling and our economy is suffering 
today the average american family is earning less than in 
at the same time health care costs are up by nearly onehalf college tuition has increased by more than onethird gas and oil prices have gone through the roof and housing costs have soared 
life literally costs more than ever before and our families have less money to pay for it 
three million more americans have fallen into poverty since 
average family debt is higher than ever 
and as they lose the struggle to make ends meet one out of every seven middle class families may be bankrupt by the end of the decade 
president bush and the republicans in congress have ignored the middle class since day one of this administration 
they have catered to the wealth of the richest instead of honoring the work of the rest of us 
they have promised almost everything and paid for almost nothing 
and the middle class is shouldering more taxes earning less money and bearing higher costs 
the bottom line for the middle class under president bush and the republican party is this instead of working hard to get ahead the middle class is working hard just to get by 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a stronger more prosperous america for all our people 
we believe in an america where the great american promise of upward mobility is alive and well 
we believe in an america where the middle class is growing our economy is thriving and america is strong 
and we have a plan to build that america 
first we must restore our values to our tax code 
we want a tax code that rewards work and creates wealth for more people not a tax code that hoards wealth for those who already have it 
with the middle class under assault like never before we simply can not afford the massive bush tax cuts for the very wealthiest 
we should set taxes for families making more than a year at the same level as in the late s a period of great prosperity when the wealthiest americans thrived without special treatment 
we will cut taxes for percent of americans and help families meet the economic challenges of their everyday lives 
and we will oppose tax increases on middle class families including those living abroad 
we must help americans deal with the staggering increase in everyday costs of living from insurance premiums to child care to the price of gas 
today thousands of businesses that would otherwise provide raises are using that money to pay climbing health care premiums 
that is cutting wages for working people 
reforming health care offering tax credits to pay for it and cutting health costs will raise wages for working people 
college tuitions rose by percent between and and this year americans were priced out of college by its high costs 
we will make college affordable for every qualified student with a tax credit for four years of college 
child care costs are rising twice as fast as inflation and millions of working parents worry desperately how to care for their children between pm and pm each day 
other families must care not only for their children but also for loved ones who are older or have disabilities 
we will increase tax credits to pay for child care and eldercare and make sure those credits are available to lowerincome families and stayathome parents 
we will expand afterschool opportunities help schools stay open until pm and offer good transportation so young people can take advantage of it 
we support expanding family and medical leave to help parents meet the growing challenge of balancing work and family responsibilities 
the price of gas is at an all timehigh placing an enormous burden on millions of americans who have no choice but to drive to work 
we will help cut costs in the shortrun by halting additional stockpiling of oil reserves and working more effectively to ensure that opec increases production 
for the longrun we offer a detailed plan for energy independence 
we must protect the retirement security of americas workers and their families 
workers should never lose all their savings because their employer locked those savings into the companys own stock 
we will bar that practice 
we need to require honest information and full disclosure and protect older workers from unfair treatment when their benefits are converted to cash balance plans 
at the same time we will strengthen and promote both definedcontribution and definedbenefit pension plans and increase the portability of retirement savings and help all families save 
we are absolutely committed to preserving social security 
it is a compact across the generations that has helped tens of millions of americans live their retirement years in dignity instead of poverty 
democrats believe in the progressive guaranteed benefit that has ensured that seniors and people with disabilities receive a benefit not subject to the whims of the market or the economy 
we oppose privatizing social security or raising the retirement age 
we oppose reducing the benefits earned by workers just because they have also earned a benefit from certain public retirement plans 
we will repeal discriminatory laws that penalize some retired workers and their families while allowing others to receive full benefits 
because the massive deficits under the bush administration have raided hundreds of billions of dollars from social security the most important step we can take to strengthen social security is to restore fiscal responsibility 
social security matters to all americans democrats and republicans and strengthening social security should be a common cause 
the dream of the middle class should belong to all americans willing to work for it 
we still have work to do as long as millions of americans work fulltime fulfill their responsibilities and continue to live in poverty 
we will offer these americans a ladder to the middle class 
that means raising the minimum wage to increasing the earned income tax credit and extending child credits so that parents who work fulltime dont have to raise their children in poverty 
it means working to eliminate hunger in our rural and urban communities 
it means using our tax code and savings incentives to help families build their savings become homeowners and start businesses 
and it means continuing on the path of welfare reform 
we must match parents responsibility to work with the real opportunity to do so by making sure parents can get the health care child care and transportation they need 
and we must expect increased responsibility from fathers as well as mothers by increasing child support enforcement and promoting responsible fatherhood together with religious and civic organizations 
we will invest in the businesses schools and hospitals that metropolitan areas need to thrive 
we will support quality housing opportunities and a balanced housing policy for all americans defending good rental housing and extending the american dream of homeownership to more families 
at a time when so many families are losing their homes and life savings to unscrupulous lenders we will rein in predatory lending and expand access to mainstream financial services for urban families 
and we will redouble our nations commitment to closing the digital divide 
small towns are at the heart of america but today they are often losing people jobs and hope 
we will use new technologies like distance learning and telemedicine to link our towns with cuttingedge advances and bring back investment to our small towns 
we will ensure that american farmers have a strong safety net and can achieve profitability in the marketplace and we will support incentives for farmers to use conservation practices and sustainable farming methods 
americans should be able to make the choice to raise their children in the towns and rural communities where they grew up 
we must restore responsibility to our budget or we will strangle opportunity for the next generation of middle class americans 
over the last three years record surpluses have turned into record deficits 
not once has this administration tried to balance new spending with new savings or pay for new initiatives including its enormous tax breaks for the wealthy 
today we face unsustainable foreign borrowing and rising interest rates 
fiscal discipline helped create million new jobs in the s 
fiscal discipline frees up money for productive investment 
and over time fiscal discipline saves families thousands of dollars on their mortgages and credit cards 
we will roll back the bush tax cuts for those making more than 
we will restore commonsense budget rules that this administration has abandoned like payasyougo rules that require the government to pay for new initiatives 
we will commit to living within tough budget capsreal and enforceable limits on what the government can spend 
we will enact a constitutional version of the lineitem veto to make it easier to root out porkbarrel spending 
and we will make our government more efficient by cutting the waste of taxpayer dollars in the federal budget from unneeded travel budgets to crony contracting 
we are committed to cutting the deficit in half over the next four years 
many american corporations today pay less than ever in taxes because of tax loopholes secured by powerful lobbyists 
we will end corporate welfare as we know it 
we will eliminate the indefensible loopholes in our tax code from tax deals that have no purpose but avoiding taxes to the very shelters that enron used to drive so many lives toward financial ruin 
and we will eliminate the corporate subsidies that waste taxpayer dollars and undermine fair competition 
the democratic party understands that working people built modern america 
we understand that todays global economy requires new rules new skills and new approaches and we believe that the timehonored values of equal opportunity fair play and good rewards for hard work still apply 
thats how we give all our people the chance to succeed 
thats how we keep on building the america we believe in 
thats how we keep the promise of america 
family is the center of everyday american life 
our parents are our first protectors first teachers first role models and first friends 
parents know that americas great reward is the quiet but incomparable satisfaction that comes from building their families a better life 
strong families blessed with opportunity guided by faith and filled with dreams are the heart of a strong america 
we believe not just that a strong america begins at home but that a strong america begins in the home 
and just as governments first responsibility is the health and safety of its people parents first responsibility is the health and safety of their children 
we believe that health care is a right and not a privilege 
today a familys ability to ensure that all its members get the quality health care they deserve is challenged like never before 
for the most fortunate america offers the best health care in the world 
but tens of millions of americans pay too much and get too little from our health care system and tens of millions more have no health insurance at all 
skyrocketing health care costs not only hurt our families they hurt our economy 
american businesses pay more than their competitors for health care reducing their competitiveness 
american incomes suffer because raises are stifled by rising insurance premiums 
we will attack the health care crisis with a comprehensive approach 
our goal is straightforward quality affordable health coverage for all americans to keep our families healthy our businesses competitive and our country strong 
in president george bushs america drug company and hmo profits count for more than family and small business health costs 
health care costs increased four times as fast as wages in the last year alone 
prescription drug spending has more than doubled during the past five years 
nearly million americans went without health care coverage at some point in the last two years 
and the president has done nothing to bring costs down or lift these burdens 
the few small proposals he has offered would further divide our health system between one that is affordable for the healthy and wealthy and one that is unaffordable for the elderly the sick and increasingly for americas broad middle class 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a better stronger healthier america 
our resolve to fix the health crisis is stronger than ever 
in the wealthiest country in the world every expectant mother should get quality prenatal care every child should get regular checkups every senior should be able to get safe affordable prescription drugs and no hardworking family should ever lose everything because illness strikes a loved one 
the job begins with our children 
it is a disgrace that nearly million children still lack health insurance 
we will strengthen medicaid for our families and expand the childrens health program created under president clinton so no child goes without medical care 
under the leadership of john kerry and john edwards we will offer individuals and businesses tax credits to make quality reliable health coverage more affordable 
we will provide tax credits to americans who are approaching retirement age and those who are between jobs so they can afford quality reliable coverage 
we will expand coverage for low income adults through existing federalstate health care programs 
and we will provide all americans with access to the same coverage that members of congress give themselves 
at the center of our efforts will be a plan to reduce health costs 
we will lift a financial burden on families businesses and the selfemployed by picking up the tab for the highestcost medical cases 
that will save americas families up to on their premiums 
we will improve the quality of care and the efficiency of the medical system by using american technological knowhow to cut billions of dollars wasted in administrative processing and paperwork 
today about a quarter of all healthrelated spending is not even medical 
we can do better 
we will ensure that all americans have secure private electronic medical records by and we will give medical providers incentives and resources to simplify their paperwork so patients spend more time with doctors and less time filling out forms 
we recognize that our health care system is substantially strengthened by the daily efforts of the men and women in a variety of health professions and we support fair treatment for all health professionals 
we will enact a real patients bill of rights to put doctors and nurses back in charge of making medical decisions with their patients instead of allowing hmo bureaucrats to decide what a patient needs 
we oppose privatizing medicare 
we will not allow republicans to destroy a commitment that has done so much good for so many seniors and people with disabilities over the past years 
instead we want to strengthen medicare and make it more efficient 
we will ensure that seniors across the country particularly in smalltown and rural america no longer suffer from geographic discrimination 
we will end the disgrace of seniors being forced to choose between meals and medication 
today our seniors are paying too much for prescription drugs while options abroad are far cheaper and just as safe 
we will allow the safe reimportation of drugs from other countries 
the current medicare drug program serves drug companies more than seniors 
it allows these companies to change the price of prescriptions more frequently than seniors can change their plans 
it does virtually nothing to bring down prescription drug costs 
it forces seniors into hmos 
elderly americans deserve a real prescription drug benefit one that uses the governments purchasing power to lower costs and ensures access to new therapies for their illnesses 
we will cut the waste and abuse that cost medicare billions each year using competitive bidding to lower the costs of buying medical equipment educating providers to file claims more efficiently and increasing penalties for those who bilk the system 
we will ensure that elderly americans and people with disabilities can live in dignity with quality options for longterm care 
we need to expand alternative care options and provide better assistance for those who give care 
no one should be kept in a nursing home or institution if they prefer living in dignity elsewhere and can do so 
and we will ensure that no person with a disability has to choose between quality health care and the dignity of work 
we will also work to ensure that people with hiv and aids have the care they need and we will support the communitybased prevention programs built on experience with real life that president bush has cut 
we are committed to passing the wellstone mental health parity legislation ending discrimination against americans with mental illnesses and ensuring equal treatment for mental illness in our health system 
millions of african americans latinos asian americans pacific islanders and american indians continue to live sicker and die younger in america 
cultural and language barriers remain a particular problem for immigrant communities 
we will fight racial and ethnic health care disparities by increasing research and training in the medical profession breaking down language barriers and ensuring good health care for all americans 
we will encourage and support enabling more minority students to enter the sciences 
we will also work to ensure that women have access to the best medicines and stateoftheart prevention and detection techniques to stop diseases early 
we will also support prevention of illness through better nutrition and exercise 
we will push the boundaries of science in search of new medical therapies and cures 
the bush administration has put ideology over science skewing information about everything from womens health to scientific research 
americans deserve access to the best evidence available about illnesses therapies and cures 
from new therapies to prolong life for people with aids to new openings in the battle to cure cancer the possibilities of medical research fill us with hope 
we will secure more funding for aggressive biomedical research seeking affordable and effective therapies based on real science 
president bush has rejected the calls from nancy reagan christopher reeve and americans across the land for assistance with embryonic stem cell research 
we will reverse his wrongheaded policy 
stem cell therapy offers hope to more than million americans who have serious illnesses from alzheimers to heart disease to juvenile diabetes to parkinsons 
we will pursue this research under the strictest ethical guidelines but we will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering 
finally we will never forget the debt america owes our veterans 
patriotism means keeping faith with those who have worn the uniform of the united states 
this administration has broken its promises to our veterans raising their health costs and reducing their access to care 
john kerry john edwards and the democrats will keep faith with our veterans 
we will continue the fight for mandatory funding for veterans health care and we will make sure that disabled veterans and military retirees are not penalized with reductions in their pension benefits 
and we will aggressively address the inexcusable backlogs in veterans compensation and pension claims 
we believe in an america where health care is available and affordable 
where every family looks to the future with hope and excitement without worry that the cost of health care is becoming too great to bear 
where strong healthy families build a stronger america 
the simple bargain at the heart of the american dream offers opportunity to every american who takes the responsibility to make the most of it 
that bargain is the great source of american strength because it unleashes the amazing talent and determination of our people 
and as our people seize the opportunity to build a better life they build a stronger country 
today our people compete with workers on every continent 
information flows across oceans 
highwage jobs are more dependent than ever on highlevel skills 
now as never before education is the key to opportunity essential to a strong america 
so we believe in an america that offers the best education to all our children wherever they live whatever their background 
period 
we believe in an america where every child comes to school ready to learn 
where every student is held to high standards and every school has the resources and responsibility to meet those standards 
where every classroom has a great teacher and every student gets enough personal attention to foster a talent or overcome a difficulty 
we believe in an america where every teenager completes a rigorous high school curriculum 
where every qualified young person who wants to go to college can afford it 
and where every adult who needs additional job training can get it 
in president george bushs america our government ignores the shameful truth that the quality of a childs education depends on the wealth of that childs neighborhood 
our best public schools are the best schools in the world but too many children go to schools that just dont work 
too many children who beat the odds and succeed in school cant afford to go on to college 
and too many adults who need added training arent able to get it 
for this white house education is an easy promise easy come and easy go 
when president bush signed the no child left behind act he said the right things asking more from our schools and pledging to give them the resources to get the job done 
and then he promptly broke his word providing schools billion less than he had promised literally leaving millions of children behind 
the president also gets a failing grade for higher education 
over the last three years college tuitions have risen by percent pricing students out of college 
yet while thengovernor bush promised to increase college aid president bush tried to charge more for student loans and eliminate pell grants for students 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe that a strong america begins at home with strong families and that strong families need the best schools 
we believe schools must teach fundamental skills like math and science and fundamental values like citizenship and responsibility 
we believe providing resources without reform is a waste of money and reform without resources is a waste of time 
and we believe politicians who expect students to learn responsibility should start by keeping their own promises 
under john kerry and john edwards we will offer high quality early learning opportunities smaller classes more after school activities and more individualized attention for our students particularly students with special needs gifts and talents 
the federal government will meet its financial obligations for elementary and secondary education and for special education 
continuing the fight for reform we will make an intensive effort to put a great teacher in every classroom 
nothing has a bigger impact than a teacher on the quality of a childs education 
we need to do more to attract and retain teachers more to encourage their excellence and more to ensure that all teachers are offering highquality teaching 
we must raise pay for teachers especially in the schools and subjects where great teachers are in the shortest supply 
we must improve mentoring professional development and new technology training for teachers instead of leaving them to sink or swim 
at the same time we must create rigorous new incentives and tests for new teachers 
we need new rewards for teachers who go the extra mile and excel in helping children learn 
and teachers deserve due process protection from arbitrary dismissal but we must have fast fair procedures for improving or removing teachers who do not perform on the job 
parents are our childrens first and most important teachers and they have a responsibility to participate in their childrens education 
we will help them do so by offering information and resources to better teach their children whether reminding them about homework or attending a parentteacher conference 
vast achievement gaps persist in america 
nearly half of africanamerican latino and american indian youth dont graduate high school 
we believe in the potential of every child and we will not accept this loss of talent 
because education in the earliest years of a childs life is critical we will expand and improve preschool and head start initiatives with the goal of offering these opportunities to all children 
because children need safe loving and disciplined homes in order to learn we will work on a bipartisan basis to reform foster care 
and we will undertake a national campaign to raise graduation rates by raising student achievement expecting more from schools reaching out to troubled youth with mentoring and tutoring and strengthening the basic high school curriculum 
we will meet these challenges togetherparents teachers principals educational support professionals and paraprofessionals along with universities communitybased and faithbased organizations 
we will use testing to advance real learning not undermine it by developing highquality assessments that measure the complex skills students need to develop 
we will make sure that federal law operates with high standards and common sense not just bureaucratic rigidity 
instead of pushing private school vouchers that funnel scarce dollars away from the public schools we will support public school choice including charter schools and magnet schools that meet the same high standards as other schools 
and at a time when so many schools charged with our future are relics of the past we will build new schools and offer the technology and equipment for a st century education 
with the leadership of john kerry and john edwards we will make college more affordable so that more young people get higher education and more of those who graduate get relief from the crushing burden of debt 
we will make student aid faster and simpler to get so students arent scared off by the complicated process 
we will offer generous tax credits to reduce the price of four years of college for all students including those who pay their own way and can least afford college now 
we will strengthen our aid programs for students while eliminating wasteful subsidies for lenders 
at a time when all good jobs increasingly depend on advanced skills we will strengthen technical training for those who do not attend college 
finally we must place a special emphasis on expanding achievement in math and science 
these are subjects where america has always led the world and must continue to lead in the st century 
we must remain committed to the moral and civic dimensions of education 
education requires the engagement of the whole community in order to teach the whole child 
students should learn responsibility in our schools and students who are irresponsibleusing drugs or bringing violence into schoolsmust face strict discipline 
we should support character education in our elementary and secondary schools and community service as a condition of graduation from high schools 
we should also give back to those who give to america in the tradition of the gi bill and americorps 
the promise of america is the promise of opportunity 
if we are going to keep that promise every child should have a great teacher and every high school graduate should have the chance to go to college 
nothing less is good enough for america 
for generations americans of all political beliefs have understood that the protection of our environment and the stewardship of our land are vital to the strength of our nation 
god gave america extraordinary natural gifts it is our responsibility to protect them 
the health of our families the strength of our economy and the wellbeing of our world all depend upon a clean environment 
but in president george bushs government where polluters actually write environmental laws and oil company profits matter more than hard science and cold facts protecting the environment doesnt matter at all 
even though million americans already live with unhealthy air the bush administration bowed to energy industry lobbying and rewrote rules to allow facilities to spew more smog soot and mercury into the air 
even though public water systems in many cities are polluted they have taken environmental cops off the beat and pushed to allow more arsenic in our water 
even though the president promised more than five billion dollars for our national parks he has delivered a fraction of that leaving trails closed historic structures collapsing and our parks losing luster 
and even though overwhelming scientific evidence shows that global climate change is a scientific fact this administration has rewritten government reports to hide that fact 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a stronger safer healthier america 
a strong america depends on healthy families and healthy families depend on fresh air pure water and clean neighborhoods 
these are our commitments we will make our air cleaner and our water purer 
we will ensure our children can safely play in our neighborhoods our families can enjoy our national parks and our sportsmen can hunt and fish in our lakes and forests 
we will foster a healthy economy and a healthy environment by promoting new technologies that create good jobs and improve our world 
and we will work with our allies to achieve these goals and to protect the global environment for this generation and future generations 
we reject the false choice between a healthy economy and a healthy environment 
we know instead that farming fishing tourism and other industries require a healthy environment 
we know new technologies that protect the environment can create new highpaying jobs 
we know a cleaner environment means a stronger economy 
we will strengthen protection for our air by making our government and our markets work together 
we will strengthen the clean air act by controlling all of the top pollutants and offering new flexibility to industries that commit to cleaning up within that framework 
we will reduce mercury emissions smog and acid rain and will address the challenge of climate change with the seriousness of purpose this great challenge demands 
rather than looking at american industries only as polluters we will work with the private sector to create partnerships that make a profit and a cleaner world for us all 
at the same time we will plug republicancreated legal loopholes and renew public enforcement of the law 
we will work with communities to reduce water pollutionnot only from factories but also from large corporate farms storm water runoff and sewer overflows 
we will bring environmental justice to lowincome rural and minority communities using federal resources to improve public health and spur economic development by cleaning up polluted sites 
we will restore the polluter pays principle to fund the cleanup of the most polluted sites so that those who cause environmental problems pay to fix them 
we will protect nevada and its communities from the highlevel nuclear waste dump at yucca mountain which has not been proven to be safe by sound science 
we will use our natural resources to fuel our economy but end republican giveaways to special interests that exploit public lands without regard for environmental consequences 
we will require companies to restore leased lands to their original state after their work is done 
and we will make sure our government treats our national parks with the same respect and care that millions of families show each year when they visit 
we are committed to protecting the lands used by hunters and anglers and we will open millions of new acres of land to public hunting and fishing 
we will conserve and restore the habitats where wildlife flourish expanding use of voluntary incentivebased programs that target private landowners 
we know that americas fight for a healthy environment can not be waged within our borders alone 
environmental hazards from around the globe reach america through the oceans and the jet streams encircling our planet 
and climate change is a major international challenge that requires global leadership from the united states not abdication 
we must restore american leadership on this issue as well as others such as hazardous waste emissions and depleted fisheries 
this great land has been placed in our hands for safekeeping 
it is our responsibility to protect it 
we will exercise that responsibility with the courage to take on special interests the creativity to promote new technologies the determination to reassert our global leadership and the commitment to achieve real results 
that is how we will ensure that gods gifts of nature bless all of gods children for generations to come 
american history is the story of a diverse people striving sometimes fitfully but in the end faithfully to realize our ideals a common dream of equality and opportunity freedom and community 
each step along that path has made us stronger 
this year we recall two of our countrys greatest steps toward equality and inclusion fifty years ago brown v board of education and forty years ago the civil rights act of 
those great achievements of the civil rights movement strengthened america immeasurablyby breaking down the legal barriers to equal citizenship for africanamericans and expanding the circle of equal opportunity for all 
this year as we celebrate these anniversaries we recommit to the spirit of service that secured these breakthroughs and the values they embody all of our people should have the opportunity to fulfill all of their potential and each of us should be as equal in the eyes of the law as we are in the eyes of god 
that is the america we believe in 
that is the america we are fighting for 
that is the america we will build together 
president bush has a different vision instead of searching for common ground to bring our people together he has sought political advantage in driving our people apart 
he has neglected the opportunity of most americans choosing instead to lavish resources on those who need them least 
he has rejected the american vision of greater equality appointing judges more interested in rolling back rights than protecting them 
perhaps most striking of all in a time of war he has abandoned our great tradition of asking americans to meet shared challenges in a spirit of shared sacrifice 
this president has regularly governed for the benefit of special interests not the public interest 
john kerry john edwards and the democratic party believe in a better america more equal more free more american 
we believe in common service to our commonwealth 
and we will restore the commitment to ethics in government 
our commitment to civil rights is ironclad 
we will restore vigorous federal enforcement of our civil rights laws for all our people from fair housing to equal employment opportunity from title ix to the americans with disabilities act 
we support affirmative action to redress discrimination and to achieve the diversity from which all americans benefit 
we believe a days work is worth a days pay and at a time when women still earn cents for every dollar earned by men we need stronger equal pay laws and stronger enforcement of them 
we will enact the bipartisan legislation barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation 
we are committed to equal treatment of all service members and believe all patriotic americans should be allowed to serve our country without discrimination persecution or violence 
we support the appointment of judges who will uphold our laws and constitutional rights not their own narrow agendas 
voting is the foundation of democracy a central act of civic engagement and an expression of equal citizenship 
voting rights are important precisely because they are protective of all other rights 
we will call for legislative action that will fully protect and enforce the fundamental constitutional right of every american to vote to ensure that the constitutions promise is fully realized and that in disputed elections every vote is counted fully and fairly 
to advance these goals and to guarantee the integrity of our elections and to increase voter confidence we will seek action to ensure that voting systems are accessible independently auditable accurate and secure 
we will support the full funding of programs to realize this goal 
finally it is the priority of the democratic party to fulfill the promise of election reform reauthorize the expiring provisions of the voting rights act and vigorously enforce all our voting rights laws 
our voting procedures are observed by people and nations around the world 
every vote must count and every vote must be counted including absentee ballots 
to achieve all of our goals we support moving toward a census that duly counts every american 
and we support the election of candidates who express the many voices of america 
because our democracy thrives on public access to diverse sources of information from multiple sources we support measures to ensure diversity competition and localism in media ownership 
we will defend the dignity of all americans against those who would undermine it 
because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay 
we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right 
at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives 
abortion should be safe legal and rare 
racial and religious profiling is wrong and we will work to stamp it out 
hate crimes desecrate sacred spaces and demean good people and we support a strong national law to punish them 
we will extend the promise of citizenship to those still struggling for freedom 
todays immigration laws do not reflect our values or serve our security and we will work for real reform 
the solution is not to establish a massive new status of secondclass workers that betrays our values and hurts all working people 
undocumented immigrants within our borders who clear a background check work hard and pay taxes should have a path to earn full participation in america 
we will hasten family reunification for parents and children husbands and wives and offer more englishlanguage and civic education classes so immigrants can assume all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship 
as we undertake these steps we will work with our neighbors to strengthen our security so we are safer from those who would come here to harm us 
we are a nation of immigrants and from arabamericans in california to latinos in florida we share the dream of a better life in the country we love 
we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families 
in our country marriage has been defined at the state level for years and we believe it should continue to be defined there 
we repudiate president bushs divisive effort to politicize the constitution by pursuing a federal marriage amendment 
our goal is to bring americans together not drive them apart 
we will honor our nations tradition of equal justice under law 
president bush and attorney general ashcroft believe they can claim powers above and beyond the law of the land 
as democrats and americans we yield to no one in our commitment to do everything necessary to win the war on terror 
but we can and must win that war without sacrificing the values we are defending 
america must be strong and free 
as we encourage democracy around the world we must extend democracy here at home 
we support equal rights to democratic selfgovernment and congressional representation for the citizens of our nations capital 
we believe that four million disenfranchised american citizens residing in puerto rico have the right to the permanent and fully democratic status of their choice 
the white house and congress will clarify the realistic status options for puerto rico and enable puerto ricans to choose among them 
we support full selfgovernment for the people of guam american samoa and the virgin islands and their right to decide their future status 
for all those who live under our flag we support strong economic development and fair and equitable treatment under federal programs 
we honor the sovereignty of american indians and reaffirm our commitment to respectful and meaningful governmenttogovernment relations 
we must renew the trust obligations that this administration has disregarded and must improve the education health and job opportunities for american indians who too often face terrible poverty 
we honor the central place of faith in the lives of our people 
like our founders we believe that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires 
we will strengthen the role of faithbased organizations in meeting challenges like homelessness youth violence and other social problems 
at the same time we will honor first amendment protections and not allow public funds to be used to proselytize or discriminate 
throughout history communities of faith have brought comfort to the afflicted and shaped great movements for justice 
we know they will continue to do so and we will always protect all americans freedom to worship 
we pledge to stand up for our beliefs and rally americans to our cause 
but we recognize that disagreements will remain and we believe disagreement should not mean disrespect 
members of our party have deeply held and differing views on some matters of conscience and faith 
we view diversity of views as a source of strength and we welcome into our ranks all americans who seek to build a stronger america 
we are committed to resolving our differences in a spirit of civility hope and mutual respect 
thats the america we believe in
