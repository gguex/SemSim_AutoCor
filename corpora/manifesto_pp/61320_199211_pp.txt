two hundred summers ago this democratic party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the american revolution who once argued we should overthrow our own government every years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world 
in the party thomas jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew 
our land reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from americas very soul from the families in our bedrock neighborhoods from the unsung workaday heroes of the worlds greatest democracy and economy 
the american people are hurting 
the american dream of expanding opportunity has faded 
middle class families are working hard playing by the rules but still falling behind 
poverty has exploded 
our people are torn by divisions 
the last years have been a nightmare of republican irresponsibility and neglect 
americas leadership is indifferent at home and uncertain in the world 
republican mismanagement has disarmed government as an instrument to make our economy work and support the peoples most basic values needs and hopes 
the republicans brought america a false and fragile prosperity based on borrowing not income and so will leave behind a mountain of public debt and a backbreaking annual burden in interest 
it is wrong to borrow to spend on ourselves leaving our children to pay our debts 
we hear the anguish and the anger of the american people 
we know it is directed not just at the republican administrations that have had power but at government itself 
their anger is justified 
we can no longer afford business as usual neither the policies of the last years of tax breaks for the rich mismanagement lack of leadership and cuts in services for the middle class and the poor nor the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking 
it is time to listen to the grassroots of america time to renew the spirit of citizen activism that has always been the touchstone of a free and democratic society 
therefore we call for a revolution in government to take power away from entrenched bureaucracies and narrow interests in washington and put it back in the hands of ordinary people 
we vow to make government more decentralized more flexible and more accountable to reform public institutions and replace public officials who arent leading with ones who will 
the revolution of is about restoring americas economic greatness 
we need to rebuild america by abandoning the somethingfornothing ethic of the last decade and putting people first for a change 
only a thriving economy a strong manufacturing base and growth in creative new enterprise can generate the resources to meet the nations pressing human and social needs 
an expanding entrepreneurial economy of highskill highwage jobs is the most important family policy urban policy labor policy minority policy and foreign policy america can have 
the revolution of is about putting government back on the side of working men and women to help those who work hard pay their bills play by the rules dont lobby for tax breaks do their best to give their kids a good education and to keep them away from drugs who want a safe neighborhood for their families the security of decent productive jobs for themselves and a dignified life for their parents 
the revolution of is about a radical change in the way government operates 
not the republican proposition that government has no role nor the old notion that theres a program for every problem but a shift to a more efficient flexible and resultsoriented government that improves services expands choices and empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottom up 
we believe in an activist government but it must work in a different more responsive way 
the revolution of is about facing up to tough choices 
there is no relief for americas frustration in the politics of diversion and evasion of false choices or of no choices at all 
instead of everyone in washington blaming one another for inaction we will act decisively and ask to be held accountable if we dont 
above all the revolution of is about restoring the basic american values that built this country and will always make it great personal responsibility individual liberty tolerance faith family and hard work 
we offer the american people not only new ideas a new course and a new president but a return to the enduring principles that set our nation apart the promise of opportunity the strength of community the dignity of work and a decent life for senior citizens 
to make this revolution we seek a new covenant to repair the damaged bond between the american people and their government that will expand opportunity insist upon greater individual responsibility in return restore community and ensure national security in a profoundly new era 
we welcome the close scrutiny of the american people including americans who may have thought the democratic party had forgotten its way as well as all who know us as the champions of those who have been denied a chance 
with this platform we take our case for change to the american people 
our partys first priority is opportunity broad based noninflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it 
democrats in hold nothing more important for america than an economy that offers growth and jobs for all 
president bush with no interest in domestic policy has given america the slowest economic growth the slowest income growth and the slowest jobs growth since the great depression 
and the american people know the long bush recession reflects not just a business cycle but a longterm slide so that even in a fragile recovery were sinking 
the ballooning bush deficits hijacked capital from productive investments 
savings and loan sharks enriched themselves at their countrys expense 
the stock market tripled but average incomes stalled and poverty claimed more of our children 
we reject both the donothing government of the last twelve years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity 
instead we offer a third way 
just as we have always viewed working men and women as the bedrock of our economy we honor business as a noble endeavor and vow to create a far better climate for firms and independent contractors of all sizes that empower their workers revolutionize their workplaces respect the environment and serve their communities well 
we believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces 
but economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy to invest in people 
for twelve years our country has had no economic vision leadership or strategy 
it is time to put our people and our country first 
the only way to lay the foundation for renewed american prosperity is to spur both public and private investment 
we must strive to close both the budget deficit and the investment gap 
our major competitors invest far more than we do in roads bridges and the information networks and technologies of the future 
we will rebuild america by investing more in transportation environmental technologies defense conversion and a national information network 
to begin making our economy grow the president and congress should agree that savings from defense must be reinvested productively at home including research education and training and other productive investments 
this will sharply increase the meager nine percent of the national budget now devoted to the future 
we will create a future budget for investments that make us richer to be kept separate from those parts of the budget that pay for the past and present 
for the private sector instead of a sweeping capital gains windfall to the wealthy and those who speculate we will create an investment tax credit and a capital gains reduction for patient investors in emerging technologies and new businesses 
we will take back the advantage now ceded to japan and germany which invest in new technologies at higher rates than the u s and have the growth to show for it 
we will make the rd tax credit permanent double basic research in the key technologies for our future and create a civilian research agency to fastforward their development 
addressing the deficit requires fair and shared sacrifice of all americans for the common good 
in republican years a national debt that took years to accumulate has been quadrupled 
rising interest on that debt now swallows one tax dollar in seven 
in place of the republican supplyside disaster the democratic investment economic conversion and growth strategy will generate more revenues from a growing economy 
we must also tackle spending by putting everything on the table eliminate nonproductive programs achieve defense savings reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs cut federal administrative costs by percent annually for four years 
limit increases in the present budget to the rate of growth in the average americans paycheck apply a strict pay as you go rule to new noninvestment spending and make the rich pay their fair share in taxes 
these choices will be made while protecting senior citizens and without further victimizing the poor 
this deficit reduction effort will encourage private savings eliminate the budget deficit over time and permit fiscal policies that can restore americas economic health 
our economy needs both the people and the funds released from defense at the cold wars end 
we will help the stalwarts of that struggle the men and women who served in our armed forces and who work in our defense industries â€“ make the most of a new era 
we will provide early notice of program changes to give commun ties businesses and workers enough time to plan 
we will honor and support our veterans 
departing military personnel defense workers and defense support personnel will have access to job retraining continuing education placement and relocation assistance early retirement benefits for military personnel and incentives to enter teaching law enforcement and other vital civilian fields 
redirected national laboratories and a new civilian research agency will put defense scientists engineers and technicians to work in critical civilian technologies 
small business defense firms will have technical assistance and transition grants and loans to help convert to civilian markets and defense dependent communities will have similar aid in planning and implementing conversion 
we will strongly support our civilian space program particularly environmental missions 
only a robust economy will revitalize our cities 
it is in all americans interest that the cities once again be places where hardworking families can put down roots and find good jobs quality health care affordable housing and decent schools 
democrats will create a new partnership to rebuild americas cities after years of republican neglect 
this partnership with the mayors will include consideration of the seven economic growth initiatives set forth by our nations mayors 
we will create jobs by investing significant resources to put people back to work beginning with a summer jobs initiative and training programs for innercity youth 
we support a stronger community development program and targeted fiscal assistance to cities that need it most 
a national public works investment and infrastructure program will provide jobs and strengthen our cities suburbs rural communities and country 
we will encourage the flow of investment to inner city development and housing through targeted enterprise zones and incentives for private and public pension funds to invest in urban and rural projects 
while cracking down on redlining and housing discrimination we also support and will enforce a revitalized community reinvestment act that challenges banks to lend to entrepreneurs and development projects 
a national network of community development banks to invest in urban and rural small businesses and microenterprise lending for poor people seeking selfemployment as an alternative to we fare 
all americans producers and consumers alike benefit when our food and fiber are produced by hundreds of thousands of family farmers r ceiving fair prices for their products 
the abundance of our nations food and fiber system should not be taken for granted 
the revolution that lifted america to the forefront of world agriculture was achieved through a unique partnership of public and private interests 
the inattention and hostility that has characterized republican food agricultural and rural development policies of the past twelve years have caused a crisis in rural america 
the cost of republican farm policy has been staggering and its total failure is demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies 
a sufficient and sustainable agricultural economy can be achieved through fiscally responsible programs 
it is time to reestablish the privatepublic partnership to ensure that family farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment so that consumers receive safe and nutritious foods 
and that needed investments are made in basic research education rural business development market development and infrastructure to sustain rural communities 
our workplaces must be revolutionized to make them more flexible and productive 
we will reform the job safety laws to empower workers with greater rights and to hold employers accountable for dangers on the job 
we will act against sexual ha assment in the workplace 
we will honor the work ethic by expanding the earned income tax credit so no one with children at home who works fulltime is still in poverty 
by fighting on the side of family farmers to ensure they get a fair price for their hard work by working to sustain rural communities 
by making work more valuable than welfare 
and by supporting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively without fear of intimidation or permanent replacement during labor disputes 
a competitive american economy requires the global markets best educated best trained most flexible workforce 
its not enough to spend more on our schools we must insist on results 
we oppose the bush administrations efforts to bankrupt the public school system the bedrock of democracy through private school vouchers 
to help children reach school ready to learn we will expand child health and nutrition programs and extend head start to all eligible children and guarantee all children access to quality affordable child care 
we deplore the savage inequalities among public schools across the land and believe every child deserves an equal chance to a world class education 
reallocating resources toward this goal must be a priority 
we support education reforms such as sitebased decisionmaking and public school choice with strong protections against discrimination 
we support the goal of a percent graduation rate and programs to end dropouts 
we will invest in educational technology and establish worldclass standards in math science and other core subjects and support effective tests of progress to meet them 
in areas where there are no registered apprenticeship programs we will adopt a national apprenticeshipstyle program to ease the transition from school to work for noncollege bound students so they can acquire skills that lead to highwage jobs 
in the new economy opportunity will depend on lifelong learning 
we will support the goal of literacy for all americans 
we will ask firms to invest in the training of all workers not just corporate management 
over the past twelve years skyrocketing costs and declining middle class incomes have placed higher education out of reach for millions of americans 
it is time to revolutionize the way student loan programs are run 
we will make college affordable to all students who are qualified to attend regardless of family income 
a domestic gi bill will enable all americans to borrow money for college so long as they are willing to pay it back as a percentage of their income over time or through national service addressing u met community needs 
all americans should have universal access to quality affordable health care not as a privilege but as a right 
that requires tough controls on health costs which are rising at two to three times the rate of inflation terrorizing american families and businesses and depriving millions of the care they need 
we will enact a uniquely american reform of the health care system to control costs and make health care affordable ensure quality and choice of health care providers cover all americans regardless of preexisting conditions squeeze out waste bureaucracy and abuse 
improve primary and preventive care including child immunization and prevention of diseases like tuberculosis now becoming rampant in our cities 
provide expanded education on the relationship between diet and health 
expand access to mental health treatment services provide a safety net through support of public hospitals 
provide for the full range of reproductive choice education counseling access to contraceptives and the right to a safe legal abortion 
expand medical research 
and provide more long term care including home health care 
we will make ending the epidemic in breast cancer a major priority and expand research on breast cervical and ovarian cancer infertility reproductive health services and other special health needs of women 
we must be united in declaring war on aids and hiv disease implement the recommendations of the national commission on aids and fully fund the ryan white care act provide targeted and honest prevention campaigns combat hivrelated discrimination make drug treatment available for all addicts who seek it guarantee access to quality care expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines and speed up the fda drug approval process 
growth and equity work in tandem 
people should share in societys common costs according to their ability to pay 
in the last decade mounting payroll and other taxes have fallen disproportionately on the middle class 
we will relieve the tax burden on middle class americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair share 
we will provide longoverdue tax relief to families with children 
to broaden opportunity we will support fair lending practices 
we reject the republican myth that energy efficiency and environmental protection are enemies of economic growth 
we will make our economy more efficient by using less energy reducing our dependence on foreign oil and producing less solid and toxic waste 
we will adopt a coordinated transportation policy with a strong commitment to mass transit 
encourage efficient alternativefueled vehicles 
increase our reliance on clean natural gas 
promote clean coal technology 
invest in rd on renewable energy sources 
strengthen efforts to prevent air and water pollution 
support incentives for domestic oil and gas operations 
and push for revenueneutral incentives that reward conservation prevent pollution and encourage recycling 
we dont have an american to waste 
democrats will continue to lead the fight to ensure that no americans suffer discrimination or deprivation of rights on the basis of race gender language national origin religion age disability sexual orientation or other characteristics irrelevant to ability 
we support the ratification of the equal rights amendment affirmative action stronger protection of voting rights for racial and ethnic minorities including language access to voting and continued resistance to discriminatory englishonly pressure groups 
we will reverse the bush administrations assault on civil rights enforcement and instead work to rebuild and vigorously use machinery for civil rights enforcement 
support comparable remedies for women 
aggressively prosecute hate crimes 
strengthen legal services for the poor 
deal with other nations in such a way that americans of any origin do not become scapegoats or victims of foreign policy disputes 
provide civil rights protection for gay men and lesbians and an end to defense department discrimination 
respect native american culture and our treaty commitments 
require the united states government to recognize its trustee obligations to the inhabitants of hawaii generally and to native hawaiians in particular 
and fully enforce the americans with dis bility act to enable people with disabilities to achieve independence and function at their highest possible level 
we recognize the existing status of the commonwealth of puerto rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of puerto rico and the united states 
we pledge to support the right of the people of the commonwealth of puerto rico to choose freely and in concert with the us congress their relationship with the united states either as an enhanced commonwealth a state or an independent nation 
we pledge to the people of american samoa guam the northern mariana islands and the virgin islands just and fair treatment under federal policies assisting their economic and social development 
we respect their right and that of the people of palau to decide freely their future relationship with the united states and to be consulted on issues and policies that directly affect them 
sixty years ago franklin roosevelt gave hope to a nation mired in the great depression 
while government should promise every american the opportunity to get ahead it was the peoples responsibility he said to make the most of that opportunity faith in america demands that we recognize the new terms of the old social contract 
in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load 
for twelve years the republicans have expected too little of our public institutions and placed too little faith in our people 
we offer a new social contract based neither on callous donothing republican neglect nor on an outdated faith in programs as the solution to every problem 
we favor a third way beyond the old approaches to put government back on the side of citizens who play by the rules 
we believe that by what it says and how it conducts its business government must once again make responsibility an instrument of national purpose 
our future as a nation depends upon the daily assumption of personal responsibility by millions of americans from all walks of life for the religious faiths they follow the ethics they practice the values they instill and the pride they take in their work 
governments dont raise children people do 
people who bring children into this world have a responsibility to care for them and give them values motivation and discipline 
children should not have children 
we need a national crackdown on deadbeat parents an effective system of child support enforcement nationwide and a systematic effort to establish paternity for every child 
we must also make it easier for parents to build strong families through pay equity 
family and medical leave will ensure that workers dont have to choose between family and work 
we support a family preservation program to reduce child and spousal abuse by providing preventive services and foster care to families in crisis 
we favor ensuring quality and affordable child care opportunities for working parents and a fair and healthy start for every child including essential prenatal and well baby care 
we support the needs of our senior citizens for productive and healthy lives including hunger prevention income adequacy transportation access and abuse prevention 
welfare should be a second chance not a way of life 
we want to break the cycle of welfare by adhering to two simple principles 
no one who is able to work can stay on welfare forever and no one who works should live in poverty 
we will continue to help those who can not help themselves 
we will offer people on welfare a new social contract 
well invest in education and job training and provide the child care and health care they need to go to work and achieve longterm self sufficiency 
we will give them the help they need to make the transition from welfare to work and require people who can work to go to work within two years in available jobs either in the private sector or in community service to meet unmet needs 
this will restore the covenant that welfare was meant to be a promise of temporary help for people who have fallen on hard times 
democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose consistent with roe vwade regardless of ability to pay and support a national law to protect that right 
it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual americans not government can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction 
the goal of our nation must be to make abortion less necessary not more difficult or more dangerous 
we pledge to support contraceptive research family planning comprehensive family life education and policies that support healthy childbearing and enable parents to care most effectively for their children 
education is a cooperative enterprise that can only succeed if everyone accepts and exercises personal responsibility 
students must stay in school and do their best 
parents must get involved in their childrens education 
teachers must attain maintain and demonstrate classroom competency 
school administrators must enforce discipline and high standards of educational attainment 
governments must end the inequalities that create educational ghettos among school districts and provide equal educational opportunity for all 
and ensure that teachers pay measures up to their decisive role in childrens lives 
and the american people should recognize education as the core of our economy democracy and society 
the private sector is the engine of our economy and the main source of national wealth 
but it is not enough for those in the private sector just to make as much money as they can 
the most irresponsible people in all of the s were those at the top of the ladder the inside traders quick buck artists and sl kingpins who looked out for themselves and not for the country 
americas corporate leaders have a responsibility to invest in their country 
ceos who pay themselves times what they pay the average worker shouldnt get big raises unrelated to performance 
if a company wants to overpay its executives and underinvest in the future or transfer jobs overseas it shouldnt get special treatment and tax breaks from the treasury 
managers must work with employees to make the workplace safer more satisfying and more efficient 
workers must also accept added responsibilities in the new economy 
in return for an i creased voice and a greater stake in the success of their enterprises workers should be prepared to join in cooperative efforts to increase productivity flexibility and quality 
governments neutrality between labor and management can not mean neutrality about the collective bargaining process which has been purposely crippled by republican administrations 
our economic growth depends on processes including collective bargaining that permit labor and management to work together on their common interests even as they work out their conflicts 
for ourselves and future generations we must protect our environment 
we will protect our old growth forests preserve critical habitats provide a genuine no net loss policy on wetlands reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals conserve the critical resources of soil water and air oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nations many environmentally critical areas and address ocean pollution by reducing oil and toxic waste spills at sea 
we believe americas youth can serve its country well through a civilian conservation corps 
to protect the public health we will clean up the environmental horrors at federal facilities insist that private polluters clean up their toxic and hazardous wastes and vigorously prosecute environmental criminals 
we will oppose republican efforts to gut the clean air act in the guise of competitiveness 
we will reduce the volume of solid waste and encourage the use of recycled materials while discouraging excess packaging 
to avoid the mistakes of the past we will actively support energy efficiency recycling and pollution prevention strategies 
democrats in intend to lead a revolution in government challenging it to act responsibly and be accountable starting with the hardest and most urgent problems of the deficit and economic growth 
rather than throw money at obsolete programs we will eliminate unnecessary layers of management cut administrative costs 
give people more choices in the service they get and empower them to make those choices 
to foster greater responsibility in government at every level we support giving greater flexibility to our cities counties and states in achieving federal mandates and carrying out existing programs 
all branches of government must live by the laws the rest of us obey determine their pay in an open manner that builds public trust and eliminate special privileges 
people in public office need to be accessible to the people they represent 
its time to reform the campaign finance system to get big money out of our politics and let the people back in 
we must limit overall campaign spending and limit the disproportionate and excessive role of pacs 
we need new voter registration laws that expand the electorate such as universal sameday registration along with full political rights and protections for public employees and new regulations to ensure that the airwaves truly help citizens make informed choices among candidates and policies 
and we need fair political representation for all sectors of our country including the district of columbia which deserves and must get statehood status 
the success of democracy in america depends substantially on the strength of our community institutions families and neighborhoods public schools religious institutions charitable organizations civic groups and other voluntary associations 
in these social networks the values and character of our citizens are formed as we learn the habits and skills of self government and acquire an understanding of our common rights and responsibilities as citizens 
twelve years of republican rule have undermined the spirit of mutual dependence and obligation that binds us together 
republican leaders have urged americans to turn inward to pursue private interests without regard to public responsibilities 
by playing racial ethnic and genderbased politics they have divided us against each other created an atmosphere of blame denial and fear and undone the hardfought battles for equality and fairness 
our communities form a vital third sector that lies between government and the marke place 
the wisdom energy and resources required to solve our problems are not concentrated in washington but can be found throughout our communities including americas nonprofit sector which has grown rapidly over the last decade 
governments best role is to enable people and communities to solve their own problems 
americas special genius has been to forge a community of shared values from people of remarkable and diverse backgrounds 
as the party of inclusion we take special pride in our countrys emergence as the worlds largest and most successful multiethnic multiracial republic 
we condemn antisemitism racism homophobia bigotry and negative stereotyping of all kinds 
we must help all americans understand the diversity of our cultural heritage 
but it is also essential that we preserve and pass on to our children the common elements that hold this mosaic together as we work to make our country a land of freedom and opportunity for all 
both republican neglect and traditional spending programs have proven unequal to these challenges 
democrats will pursue a new course that stresses work family and individual responsibility 
and that empowers americans to liberate themselves from poverty and dependence 
we pledge to bolster the institutions of civil society and place a new emphasis on civic enterprises that seek solutions to our nations problems 
through common cooperative efforts we can rebuild our communities and transform our nation 
crime is a relentless danger to our communities 
over the last decade crime has swept through our country at an alarming rate 
during the s more than americans were murdered four times the number who died in vietnam 
violent crimes rose by more than percent since and nearly doubled since 
in our country today a murder is committed every minutes a rape every six minutes a burglary every seconds 
the pervasive fear of crime disfigures our public life and diminishes our freedom 
none suffer more than the poor an explosive mixture of blighted prospects drugs and exotic weaponry has turned many of our inner city communities into combat zones 
as a result crime is not only a symptom but also a major cause of the worsening poverty and demoralization that afflicts inner city communities 
to empower americas communities democrats pledge to restore government as the upholder of basic law and order for crimeravaged communities 
the simplest and most direct way to restore order in our cities is to put more police on the streets 
americas police are locked in an unequal struggle with crime since the ratio of police officers to reported crimes has reversed from threetoone to onetothree 
we will create a police corps in which participants would receive college aid in return for several years of service after graduation in a state or local police department 
as we shift people and resources from defense to the civilian economy we will create new jobs in law enforcement for those leaving the military 
we will expand drug counselling and treatment for those who need it intensify efforts to educate our children at the earliest ages to the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse and curb demand from the street corner to the penthouse suite so that the us with five percent of the worlds population no longer consumes percent of the worlds illegal drugs 
neighborhoods and police should be partners in the war on crime 
democrats support more community policing which uses foot patrols and storefront offices to make police officers visible fixtures in urban neighborhoods 
we will combat street violence and emphasize building trust and solving the problems that breed crime 
it is time to shut down the weapons bazaars in our cities 
we support a reason ble waiting period to permit background checks for purchases of handguns as well as assault weapons controls to ban the possession sale importation and manufacture of the most deadly assault weapons 
we do not support efforts to restrict weapons used for legitimate hunting and sporting purposes 
we will work for swift and certain punishment of all people who violate the countrys gun laws and for stronger sentences for criminals who use guns 
we will also seek to shut down the black market for guns and impose severe penalties on people who sell guns to children 
in contrast to the republican policy of leniency toward white collar crime which breeds cynicism in poor communities about the impartiality of our justice system democrats will redouble efforts to ferret out and punish those who betray the public trust rig financial markets misuse their depositors money or swindle their customers 
democrats also favor innovative sentencing and punishment options including community service and boot camps for first time offenders tougher penalties for rapists victimimpact statements and restitution to ensure that crime victims will not be lost in the complexities of the criminal justice system and initiatives to make our schools safe including alternative schools for disruptive children 
we must further the new direction set in the family support act of away from subsistence and dependence and toward work family and personal initiative and responsibility 
we advocate slower phasing out of medicaid and other benefits to encourage work 
special savings accounts to help lowincome families build assets 
fair lending an indexed minimum wage an expanded job corps and an end to welfare rules that encourage family breakup and penalize individual initiative such as the limit on personal savings 
our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people ideas and ways of life have become part of the american tapestry 
democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness non discrimination and family reunification and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech association and travel 
safe secure housing is essential to the institutions of community and family 
we support homeownership for working families and will honor that commitment through policies that encourage affordable mortgage credit 
we must also confront homelessness by renovating preserving and expanding the stock of affordable lowincome housing 
we support tenant management and ownership so public housing residents can manage their own affairs and acquire property worth protecting 
we will create new opportunities for citizens to serve each other their communities and their country 
by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of volunteers national service will enhance the role of ordinary citizens in solving unresolved community problems 
we believe in public support for the arts 
including a national endowment for the arts that is free from political manipulation and firmly rooted in the first amendments freedom of expression guarantee 
during the past four years we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past divorced from our values fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges 
under president bush crises have been managed rather than prevented dictators like saddam hussein have been wooed rather than deterred aggression by the serbian regime against its neighbors in what was yugoslavia has been met by american timidity r ther than toughness human rights abusers have been rewarded not challenged the environment has been neglected not protected and americas competitive edge in the global economy has been dulled not honed 
it is time for new american leadership that can meet the challenges of a changing world 
at the end of world war ii american strength had defeated tyranny and american ingenuity had overcome the depression 
under president truman the united states led the world into a new era redefining global security with bold approaches to tough challenges containing communism with the nato alliance and in korea building the peace through organizations such as the united nations and advancing global economic security through new multilateral institutions 
nearly a half century later we stand at another pivotal point in history 
the collapse of communism does not mean the end of danger or threats to our interests 
but it does pose an unprecedented opportunity to make our future more secure and prosperous 
once again we must define a compelling vision for global leadership at the dawn of a new era 
we have not seen the end of violence aggression and the conflicts that can threaten american interests and our hopes for a more peaceful world 
what the united states needs is not the bush administrations cold war thinking on a smaller scale but a comprehensive restructuring of the american military enterprise to meet the threats that remain 
america is the worlds strongest military power and we must remain so 
a postcold war restructuring of american forces will produce substantial savings beyond those promised by the bush administration but that restructuring must be achieved without undermining our ability to meet future threats to our security 
a military structure for the s and beyond must be built on four pillars first a survivable nuclear force to deter any conceivable threat as we reduce our nuclear arsenals through arms control negotiations and other reciprocal action 
second conventional forces shifted toward projecting power wherever our vital national interests are threatened 
this means reducing the size of our forces in europe while meeting our obligations to nato 
and strengthening our rapid deployment capabilities to deal with new threats to our security posed by renegade dictators terrorists international drug traffickers and the local armed conflicts that can threaten the peace of entire regions 
third maintenance of the two qualities that make americas military the best in the world the superiority of our military personnel and of our technology 
these qualities are vital to shortening any conflict and saving american lives 
fourth intelligence capabilities redirected to develop far more sophisticated timely and accurate analyses of the economic and political conditions that can fuel new conflicts 
the united states must be prepared to use military force decisively when necessary to defend our vital interests 
the burdens of collective security in a new era must be shared fairly and we should encourage multilateral peacekeeping through the united nations and other international efforts 
american policy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them 
to halt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction we must lead a renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear and chemical warfare technologies strengthen the international atomic energy agency and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate international restraints 
a comprehensive test ban would strengthen our ability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries which may be our greatest future security threat 
we must press for strong international limits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled regions 
a us troop presence should be maintained in south k rea as long as north korea presents a threat to south korea 
the united states can not be strong abroad if it is weak at home 
restoring americas global economic leadership must become a central element of our national security policies 
the strength of nations once defined in military terms now is measured also by the skills of their workers the imagination of their managers and the power of their technologies 
either we develop and pursue a national plan for restoring our economy through a partnership of government labor and business or we slip behind the nations that are competing with us and growing 
at stake are american jobs our standard of living and the quality of life for ourselves and our children 
economic strength indeed our national security is grounded on a healthy domestic economy 
but we can not be strong at home unless we are part of a vibrant and expanding global economy that recognizes human rights and seeks to improve the living standards of all the worlds people 
this is vital to achieving good quality high paying jobs for americans 
our government must work to expand trade while insisting that the conduct of world trade is fair 
it must fight to uphold american interests promoting exports expanding trade in agricultural and other products opening markets in major product and service sectors with our principal competitors and achieving reciprocal access 
this should include renewed authority to use americas trading leverage against the most serious problems 
the us government also must firmly enforce us laws against unfair trade 
multilateral trade agreements can advance our economic interests by expanding the global economy 
whether negotiating the north american free trade area nafta or completing the gatt negotiations our government must assure that our legitimate concerns about environmental health and safety and labor standards are included
