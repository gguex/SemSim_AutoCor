with this platform we the republican party reaffirm the principles that unite us in a common purpose 
we believe in american exceptionalism 
we believe the united states of america is unlike any other nation on earth 
we believe america is exceptional because of our historic role 
first as refuge 
then as defender 
and now as exemplar of liberty for the world to see 
we affirm as did the declaration of independence that all are created equal endowed by their creator with inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
we believe in the constitution as our founding document 
we believe the constitution was written not as a flexible document but as our enduring covenant 
we believe our constitutional system limited government separation of powers federalism and the rights of the people must be preserved uncompromised for future generations 
we believe political freedom and economic freedom are indivisible 
when political freedom and economic freedom are separated both are in peril when united they are invincible 
we believe that people are the ultimate resource 
and that the people not the government are the best stewards of our countrys godgiven natural resources 
as americans and as republicans we wish for peace 
so we insist on strength 
we will make america safe 
we seek friendship with all peoples and all nations 
but we recognize and are prepared to deal with evil in the world 
based on these principles this platform is an invitation and a roadmap 
it invites every american to join us and shows the path to a stronger safer and more prosperous america 
this platform is optimistic because the american people are optimistic 
this platform lays out in clear language the path to making america great and united again 
for the past years america has been led in the wrong direction 
our economy has become unnecessarily weak with stagnant wages 
people living paycheck to paycheck are struggling sacrificing and suffering 
americans have earned and deserve a strong and healthy economy 
our standing in world affairs has declined significantly our enemies no longer fear us and our friends no long trust us 
people want and expect an america that is the most powerful and respected country on the face of the earth 
the men and women of our military remain the worlds best 
the have been shortchanged in numbers equipment and benefits by a commander in chief who treats the armed forces and our veterans as a necessary inconvenience 
the president and the democratic party have dismantled americans system of healthcare 
they have replaced it with a costly and complicated scheme that limits choices and takes away our freedom 
the president and the democratic party have abandoned their promise of being accountable to the american people 
they have nearly doubled the size of the national debt 
they refuse to control our borders 
but try to control our schools farms businesses and even our religious institutions 
they have directly attacked the production of american energy 
and the industryrelated jobs that have sustained families and communities 
the president has been regulating to death a free market economy that he does not like and does not understand 
he defies the laws of the united states by refusing to enforce those with which he does not agree 
and he appoints judges who legislate from the bench rather than apply the law 
we as republicans and americans can not allow this to continue 
that is why the many sections of this platform affirm our trust in the people our faith in their judgment and our determination to help them take back their country 
this means removing the power from unelected unaccountable government 
this means relieving the burden and expense of punishing government regulations 
and this means returning to the people and the states the control that belongs to them 
it is the control and the power to make their own decisions about whats best for themselves and their families and communities 
this platform is many things a handbook for returning decisionmaking to the people 
a guide to the constitutional rights of every american 
and a manual for the kind of sustained growth that will bring opportunity to all those on the sidelines of our society 
every time we sing god bless america we are asking for help 
we ask for divine help that our country can fulfill its promise 
we earn that help by recommitting ourselves to the ideas and ideals that are the true greatness of america 
we are the party of a growing economy that gives everyone a chance in life an opportunity to learn work and realize the prosperity freedom makes possible 
government can not create prosperity though government can limit or destroy it 
prosperity is the product of selfdiscipline enterprise saving and investment by individuals but it is not an end in itself 
prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government 
raise their children by their own values 
practice their faith 
and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect 
it is also the foundation for our nations global leadership 
for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security 
pundits and democrats tell us that we should accept the new normal of a slowgrowing economy 
the consequences are too dire to ever accept that 
president obama and his party will set a record of being the first modern president ever to leave office without a single calendar year of three percent economic growth 
as a result the number of americans living in poverty has increased by million 
our nations economy has lost nearly trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery 
and the economic growth shortfall has left a cumulative real aftertax per person personal income shortfall of nearly compared with an average recovery 
under president obama and the democrats new privatesector jobs are three million below where they should have been with just average modern postrecession growth 
our labor force participation rate has plunged to at or below percent for far too long lows last seen two generations ago before president reagan was elected in 
business closures have exceeded business startups throughout the obama presidency 
strong growth more jobs increasing incomes and expanding opportunity are all in short supply under president obama and the democrats 
we repudiate the absurd idea this is the best america can do 
the american people rejected that nonsense the last time it was offered in the historic election of 
and we ask them to join us now to again repudiate the false gospel of americas di minishment and retreat 
we offer instead our vision of an opportunity society based on the economics of inclusion 
republicans consider the establishment of a progrowth tax code a moral imperative 
more than any other public policy the way government raises revenue how much at what rates under what circumstances from whom and for whom has the greatest impact on our economys performance 
it powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation 
which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind 
getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity 
the current tax code is rightly the object of both anger and mockery 
its length is exceeded only by its complexity 
we must start anew 
that will be an enormous undertaking and if it is to succeed it must command the attention and approval of the american people 
it can not be engineered from the top down 
but must have a common sense approach and be simplified 
our proposal is straightforward 
wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment they must be lowered 
wherever current provisions of the code are disincentives for economic growth they must be changed 
we will not divide the american people into winners and losers 
we will eliminate as many special interest provisions and loopholes as possible and curb corporate welfare 
especially where their erosion of the tax base has created pressure for higher rates 
we will be mindful of the burdens on families with children 
and the impact on an aging population 
we will seek simplicity and clarity so that every taxpayer can understand how much of their income is consumed by the federal government 
we will welcome all to this enterprise to discuss debate challenge and amend 
so that together we can restore economic growth for the american people 
and even more important renew their faith in the future 
to ensure that past abuses will not be repeated we assert these fundamental principles 
we oppose retroactive taxation 
we condemn attempts by activist judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse from the peoples elected representatives by ordering higher taxes 
we oppose tax policies that deliberately divide americans or promote class warfare 
because of the vital role of religious organizations charities and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering generosity and patriotism 
they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible 
to guard against hypertaxation of the american people in any restructuring of the federal tax system 
any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the sixteenth amendment which established the federal income tax 
competitiveness equals jobs 
that equation governs our policies regarding us corporations in the global economy 
private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation 
after falling dramatically during the recession private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace 
due in part to high corporate tax rates 
and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty 
american businesses now face the worlds highest corporate tax rates 
thats like putting lead shoes on your crosscountry team 
it reduces companies ability to compete overseas encourages them to move abroad lessens their investment 
cripples job creation here at home lowers american wages 
and fosters the avoidance of tax liability 
without actually increasing tax revenues 
a more damaging policy is hard to imagine 
we propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with or below the rates of other industrial nations 
we endorse the recommendation of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform as well as the current administrations export council to switch to a territorial system of taxation so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for jobcreating investment here at home 
we believe american companies should be headquartered in america 
we should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal 
international trade is crucial for all sectors of americas economy 
massive trade deficits are not 
we envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets what has been called a reagan economic zone in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned 
we need better negotiated trade agreements that put america first 
when trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports 
when those agreements do not adequately protect us interests us sovereignty or when they are violated with impunity they must be rejected 
we can not allow foreign governments to limit american access to their markets while stealing our designs patents brands knowhow and technology 
we can not allow china to continue its currency manipulation exclusion of us products from government purchases and subsidization of chinese companies to thwart american imports 
the current administrations way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender 
republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it 
a republican president will insist on parity in trade 
and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate 
at the same time we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness 
along with transparency in our commercial and business practices 
in pursuing that objective the american people demand transparency full disclosure 
protection of our national sovereignty and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of us workers 
significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a lame duck congress 
the republican vision for american banking calls for establishing transparent efficient markets where consumers can obtain loans they need at reasonable rates based on market conditions 
unfortunately in response to the financial institutions crisis of the democraticcontrolled congress enacted the wall street reform and consumer protection act otherwise known as doddfrank 
they did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nations financial markets 
the consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators 
rather than address the cause of the crisis the governments own housing policies 
the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies 
predictably central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs it has killed them 
it has not limited risks it has created more 
it has not encouraged economic growth it has shackled it 
since the enactment of doddfrank the number of community banks has significantly declined 
and the cost and complexity of complying with the law has created impediments to the remaining banks ability to support the customers they serve 
from community banks in only remain 
still the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks 
from startups foregone to home loans not made doddfranks excessive regulation and burdensome requirements have helped contribute to the slow economy we all endure today under president obama and the democrats 
community banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper 
community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations 
we support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital 
the worst of doddfrank is the consumer financial protection bureau deliberately designed to be a rogue agency 
it answers to neither congress nor the executive 
has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process 
and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups 
its director has dictatorial powers unique in the american republic 
its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks the source of most home mortgages and small business loans advantages big banks 
and makes it harder for americans to buy a home 
its onesizefitsall approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the countrys financial system 
and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions as in many european countries 
if the bureau is not abolished it should be subjected to congressional appropriation 
in that way consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional 
any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers 
with any remaining proceeds given to the general treasury 
diversion of settlement funds to politically connected parties should be a criminal offense 
republicans believe that no financial institution is too big to fail 
we support legislation to ensure that the problems of any financial institution can be resolved through the bankruptcy code 
we endorse prudent regulation of the banking system to ensure that fdicregulated banks are properly capitalized 
and taxpayers are protected against bailouts 
we will end the governments use of disparate impact theory in enforcing antidiscrimination laws with regard to lending 
homeownership expands personal liberty 
builds communities 
and helps americans create wealth 
the american dream is not a stale slogan 
it is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people 
it means a decent place to live 
a safe place to raise kids 
a welcoming place to retire 
it bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family 
and in the process create caring neighborhoods 
the great recession devastated the housing market 
us taxpayers paid billions to rescue freddie mac and fannie mae 
the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the carter and clinton administrations 
and to cover the losses of the poorlymanaged federal housing administration 
millions lost their homes millions more lost value in their homes 
more than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting 
rental costs escalated so that today nearly million families spend more than percent of their incomes just on rent 
the national homeownership rate has sharply fallen 
and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted 
so many remain unemployed or underemployed 
and for the lucky ones with jobs rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage 
there is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past 
we understand that pessimism but do not share it 
for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy vigor to the housing market and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity 
our goal is to advance responsible home ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse 
we must scale back the federal role in the housing market 
promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders 
and avoid future taxpayer bailouts 
reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices 
compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers 
we call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations 
especially those dealing with the environment 
that make it harder and more costly for americans to rent buy or sell homes 
for nine years fannie mae and freddie mac have been in conservatorship and the current administration and democrats have prevented any effort to reform them 
their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses 
the utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort homebuying 
the federal housing administration which provides taxpayerbacked guarantees in the mortgage market should no longer support high income individuals 
and the public should not be financially exposed by risks taken by fha officials 
we will end the government mandates that required fannie mae freddie mac and federally insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups 
discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry 
zoning decisions have always been and must remain under local control 
the current administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation 
it threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country 
while the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing nondiscrimination laws 
this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the selfgovernment of citizens 
our countrys investments in transportation and other public construction have traditionally been nonpartisan 
everyone agrees on the need for clean water 
and safe roads rail bridges ports and airports 
president eisenhower established a tradition of republican leadership in this regard by championing the creation of the interstate highway system 
in recent years bipartisan cooperation led to major legislation improving the nations ports and waterways 
our republican majority ended the practice of earmarks which often diverted transportation spending to politically favored projects 
in the current congress republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the highway trust fund in a decade 
and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the federal aviation administration to make flying easier and more secure 
the current administration has a different approach 
it subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit 
its illnamed livability initiative is meant to coerce people out of their cars 
this is the same mentality that once led congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation from manhattan to montana 
our republican platform pledged to repeal that edict 
after the election of ronald reagan we did 
now we make the same pledge regarding the current problems in transportation policy 
we propose to remove from the highway trust fund programs that should not be the business of the federal government 
more than a quarter of the funds spending is diverted from its original purpose 
one fifth of its funds are spent on mass transit 
an inherently local affair that serves only a small portion of the population 
concentrated in six big cities 
additional funds are used for bikeshare programs sidewalks recreational trails landscaping and historical renovations 
other beneficiaries of highway money are ferry boats the federal lands access program scenic byways and education initiatives 
these worthwhile enterprises should be funded through other sources 
we propose to phase out the federal transit program 
and reform provisions of the national environmental policy act which can delay and drive up costs for transportation projects 
we renew our call for repeal of the davisbacon law 
which limits employment 
and drives up construction and maintenance costs 
for the benefit of unions 
recognizing that over time additional revenue will be needed to expand the carrying capacity of roads and bridges 
we will remove legal roadblocks to publicprivate partnership agreements that can save the taxpayers money and bring outside investment to meet a communitys needs 
with most of the states increasing their own funding for transportation 
we oppose a further increase in the federal gas tax 
although unionization has never been permitted in any government agency concerned with national security the current administration has reversed that policy for the transportation security administration 
we will correct that mistake 
americans understand that with the threat of terrorism their travel may encounter delays 
but un acceptably long lines at security checks can have the same impact as a collapsed bridge or washed out highway 
tsa employees should always be seen as guardians of the publics safety 
not as just another part of the federal workforce 
amtrak is an extremely expensive railroad for the american taxpayers who must subsidize every ticket 
the federal government should allow private ventures to provide passenger service in the northeast corridor 
the same holds true with regard to highspeed and intercity rail across the country 
we reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like californias highspeed train to nowhere 
the digital revolution has transformed how we work learn sell shop socialize in short how we live 
technological change drives our positions with regard to stem education 
business and corporate involvement with educational certifications 
workforce issues 
privacy 
cyber and national security 
energy development 
regulation 
and other elements of our campaign for growth and jobs 
it is why we propose to simplify the tax code 
reduce corporate rates 
transition to a territorial system 
and create incentives for investment and innovation 
we envision government at all levels as a partner with individuals and industries in technological progress 
not a meddlesome monitor 
we want to create a business climate that rewards risk and promotes innovation 
a learning system that gives americans the skills needed to seize the opportunities of the st century 
and an international order that maintains a fair and open global market for americas goods and services 
we intend to advance policies that protect data privacy 
while fostering innovation and growth and ensuring the free flow of data across borders 
together broadband and good ideas have become the st century engines of american ingenuity 
innovation by its nature is disruptive 
in challenging legacy forms of business innovation creates new jobs gives access to new markets opens opportunity to underserved populations and expands consumer choice 
government must give americas innovators the freedom to create and on their merits succeed or fail 
our agenda includes balanced protections for intellectual property explained elsewhere in this document 
we intend to facilitate access to spectrum by paving the way for highspeed next generation broadband deployment 
and competition on the internet and for internet services 
we want government to encourage the sharing economy and ondemand platforms to compete in an open market 
and we believe public policies should encourage the innovation and competition that are essential for an internet of things to thrive 
government must keep pace with the technology deployed in the private sector 
there is an urgent need to modernize the federal governments legacy systems 
and to recruit the skilled technical personnel who can advance the adoption of innovation in the public sector 
at the cost of billions the current administration has done little to advance our goal of universal broadband coverage 
that hurts rural america where farmers ranchers and small business people need connectivity to operate in real time with the worlds producers 
almost ten million americans have given up wired broadband connections in just the last two years alone and millions more have never been connected in the first place 
we encourage publicprivate partnerships to provide predictable support for connecting rural areas 
so that every american can fully participate in the global economy 
the publicprivate partnerships between nasa the department of defense and commercial companies have given us technological progress that has reduced the cost of accessing space 
and extended americas space leadership in the commercial civil and national security spheres 
the entrepreneurship and innovation culture of the free market is revitalizing the nations space capabilities 
saving taxpayer money 
and advancing technology critical to maintain americas edge in space and in other fields 
to protect our national security interests 
and foster innovation and competitiveness 
we must sustain our preeminence in space by launching more scientific missions 
guaranteeing unfettered access and ensuring that our spacerelated industries remain a source of scientific leadership and education 
our nations interstate electric transmission system has long been a catalyst for developing and delivering low cost energy 
while spurring economic growth throughout the united states 
the grid is aging 
vulnerable to cyber and terrorist threats 
and unprepared to serve our energy needs of tomorrow 
it should not take seven to ten years to plan and construct a transmission line 
we support expedited siting processes and the thoughtful expansion of the grid so that consumers and businesses continue to have access to affordable and reliable electricity 
a central reason why the th century came to be called the american century was the ability of individuals to invent and create in a land of free markets 
back then they were called risktakers dreamers and small business owners 
today they are the entrepreneurs independent contractors and small business men and women of our new economy 
their innovation drives improvement and forces longestablished institutions to adapt or fade away 
many of them are so young they remember little if anything of the last century because dynamic progress does not look back 
as in the past they still create most new jobs and form the commercial network that holds communities together 
their enterprise is the lifeblood of our economy 
but it is weakening 
more businesses are closing in our country than are starting 
older firms are an increasing proportion of companies 
productivity growth has slowed 
this is not the way to jumpstart a new era of growth 
we need to consider the effect of capital gains rates on the availability of venture capital 
as well as the positive impact of expensing on startup firms 
we should reduce the occupational licensing laws that shut untold millions of potential workers out of entrepreneurial careers 
we must overturn the regulatory nightmare created by the dodd frank law for the community banks and savings and loans that provide nearly half of all small business loans 
and over threequarters of all agricultural loans 
indeed the world of the app economy cries out for the comprehensive regulatory reform proposed elsewhere in this platform 
we must challenge established interests and traditional business patterns to facilitate market entry of new business models i 
including inventive means of transport delivery and communication 
as incubators of unconventional thinking our countrys existing research infrastructure the national labs the national institutes of health nasa and elements of the defense department 
have the potential to form partnerships with small businesses to create an american startup century 
because the federal reserves monetary policy decisions affect job creation upward mobility for workers and equitable prosperity they should be transparent 
similarly the federal reserves important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner 
the republican party will advance legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the federal reserve the federal open market committee and the federal reserves dealing with foreign banks 
the first step is through an annual audit of the federal reserves activities 
such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the federal reserve remains insulated from political pressures 
and its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than political pressures for easy money and loose credit 
determined to crush the doubledigit inflation that was part of the carter administrations economic legacy president reagan shortly after his inauguration established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for us currency 
in facing the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current administrations policies 
we proposed a similar commission to investigate ways to set a fixed value for the dollar 
with republican leadership the house of representatives has passed legislation to set up just such a commission 
we recommend its enactment by the full congress and the commissions careful consideration of ways to secure the integrity of our currency 
the greatest asset of the american economy is the hardworking american 
that is why our first priority is getting people back to work by fostering the kind of growth that creates jobs 
that overarching goal unites all the sections of this platform 
it runs through our commitments on education and workforce development 
it underlies our approach to welfare reform regulatory reform and our determination to advance the kind of trade agreements that multiply opportunities for workers here at home 
it also impels us to challenge the anachronistic labor laws that limit workers freedom and lock them into the workplace rules of their greatgrandfathers 
instead of facilitating change the current administration and its agents at the national labor relations board are determined to reverse it 
they are attacking the franchise model of business development which is essential to the flexibility and creativity of the new economy 
they are wielding provisions of the fair labor standards act from the s designed to fit a manufacturing workplace to deny flexibility to both employers and employees 
they have repealed union transparency rules that allowed members to discover what was being done with their dues 
they have outlawed alternatives to unions 
even when they were favored by the workers 
their project labor agreements discriminate against the overwhelming majority of workers by barring them from jobs on taxpayerfunded projects 
their patronizing and controlling approach leaves workers in a form of peonage to the nlrb 
we intend to restore fairness and common sense to that agency 
technology has already created jobs that did not exist fifteen years ago 
and todays workers need flexibility and familyfriendly options to make the most of them 
especially portability in pension plans and health insurance 
we intend to encourage those trends by bringing labor law into the st century 
it should encourage cooperation between management and workers not conflict 
all workers including union members must be free to accept raises and rewards without veto power from union officials 
all unionized workers should be able to find out what is going on in their union trust funds and in their executive compensation 
we support the right of states to enact righttowork laws and call for a national law to protect the economic liberty of the modern workforce 
all americans deserve the opportunity to pursue their american dream free from discrimination 
clear nondiscrimination policies ensure all employees have the chance to succeed based solely on their merits 
these policies are vital to creating an inclusive innovative and competitive workforce 
republicans believe that the employer employee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment 
and workplace flexibility 
we therefore endorse employee stock ownership plans that enable workers to become capitalists 
expand the realm of private property 
and energize a free enterprise economy 
minimum wage is an issue that should be handled at the state and local level 
the federal workforce is larger and more highly paid than ever 
the taxpayers spend an average of a year per employee on noncash benefits triple the average noncash compensation of the average worker in the private sector 
federal employees receive extraordinary pension benefits and vacation time wildly out of line with those of the private sector 
we urge congress to bring federal compensation and benefits in line with the standards of most american employees 
a republican administration should streamline personnel procedures to expedite the firing of bad workers tax cheats and scammers 
the unionization of the federal workforce first permitted by democrat presidents in the s should be reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees to examine its effects on the cost quality and performance of the civil service 
union representatives in the federal workforce should not be paid to conduct union business on the publics time 
our national debt is a burden on our economy and families 
the huge increase in the national debt demanded by and incurred during the current administration has placed a significant burden on future generations 
we must impose firm caps on future debt 
accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government 
and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations 
a strong economy is one key to debt reduction 
but spending restraint is a necessary component that must be vigorously pursued 
we are the party of the declaration of independence and the constitution 
the declaration sets forth the fundamental precepts of american government 
that god bestows certain inalienable rights on every individual 
thus producing human equality 
that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights 
that manmade law must be consistent with godgiven natural rights 
and that if godgiven natural inalienable rights come in conflict with government court or humangranted rights godgiven natural inalienable rights always prevail 
that there is a moral law recognized as the laws of nature and of natures god 
and that american government is to operate with the consent of the governed 
we are also the party of the constitution the greatest political document ever written 
it is the solemn compact built upon principles of the declaration that enshrines our godgiven individual rights 
and ensures that all americans stand equal before the law 
defines the purposes and limits of government 
and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that makes the united states the worlds freest and most prosperous nation 
we reaffirm the constitutions fundamental principles limited government separation of powers individual liberty and the rule of law 
we denounce bigotry racism antisemitism ethnic prejudice and religious intolerance 
therefore we oppose discrimination based on race sex religion creed disability or national origin and support statutes to end such discrimination 
as the party of abraham lincoln we must continue to foster solutions to americas difficult challenges when it comes to race relations today 
we continue to encourage equality for all citizens and access to the american dream 
merit and hard work should determine advancement in our society 
so we reject unfair preferences quotas and setasides as forms of discrimination 
our ranks include americans from every faith and tradition 
and we respect the right of each american to follow his or her deeply held beliefs 
our constitution is in crisis 
more than percent of federal requirements are now imposed by regulatory agencies without any vote of the house or senate or signature of the president 
the current administration has exceeded its constitutional authority 
brazenly and flagrantly violated the separation of powers 
sought to divide america into groups and turn citizen against citizen 
the president has refused to defend or enforce laws he does not like 
used executive orders to enact national policies in areas constitutionally reserved solely to congress 
made unconstitutional recess appointments to senateconfirmed positions 
directed regulatory agencies to overstep their statutory authority 
and failed to consult congress regarding military action overseas 
he has changed what john adams called a government of laws and not of men into just the opposite 
democrats in congress have enabled supported and defended each of these breaches 
they have applauded the presidents efforts to do an endrun around congress and stymied republican efforts to restrain executive lawlessness 
democrats in congress have also endorsed an anticonstitutional agenda of their own 
fortyeight democratic senators for instance voted to amend the bill of rights to give government officials control over political speech 
democrats in congress have likewise proposed bills that would limit religious liberty 
undermine property rights 
and eviscerate the second amendment 
in a free society the primary role of government is to protect the godgiven inalienable rights of its citizens 
these constitutional rights are not negotiable for any american 
we affirm that all legislation regulation and official actions must conform to the constitutions original meaning as understood at the time the language was adopted 
our most urgent task as a party is to restore the american peoples faith in their government by electing a president who will enforce duly enacted laws 
honor constitutional limits on executive authority 
and return credibility to the oval office 
we need a republican president who will end abuses of power by departments and agencies like the irs and the epa 
and by the white house itself 
safeguarding our liberties requires a president who will respect the constitutions separation of powers 
including the authority of congress to write legislation and define agency authority 
americans also deserve a president who will speak for our nations history and values 
not apologize for them to our enemies 
the rule of law is the foundation of our republic 
a critical threat to our countrys constitutional order is an activist judiciary that usurps powers properly reserved to the people through other branches of government 
only a republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule of law expressed within the constitution and declaration of independence 
including the inalienable right to life 
and the laws of nature and natures god as did the late justice antonin scalia 
we are facing a national crisis in our judiciary 
we understand that only by electing a republican president in will america have the opportunity for up to five new constitutionallyminded supreme court justices appointed to fill vacancies on the court 
only such appointments will enable courts to begin to reverse the long line of activist decisions 
including roe obergefell and the obamacare cases that have usurped congresss and states lawmaking authority 
undermined constitutional protections 
expanded the power of the judiciary at the expense of the people and their elected representatives 
and stripped the people of their power to govern themselves 
we believe in the constitutional checks and balances and that the founders intended the judiciary to be the weakest branch 
we encourage congress to use the check of impeachment for judges who unconstitutionally usurp article i powers 
in tandem with a republican senate a new republican president will restore to the court a strong conservative majority that will follow the text and original meaning of the constitution and our laws 
the legitimate powers of government are rooted in the consent of the american people 
judicial activism that includes reliance on foreign law or unratified treaties undermines american sovereignty 
foreign laws and precedents should not be used to interpret our constitution or laws 
nor should foreign sources of law be used in state courts adjudication of criminal or civil matters 
we also affirm the wisdom of president george washingtons warning to avoid foreign entanglements and unnecessary alliances 
we therefore oppose the adoption or ratification of treaties that would weaken or encroach upon american sovereignty or that could be construed by courts to do so 
we will not recognize as binding upon the united states any international agreement forged without the constitutionally required assent of twothirds of the united states senate 
article i of the constitution directs that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states 
for more than a century however congress has delegated increasing amounts of legislative authority to executive departments agencies and commissions laying the foundation for todays vast administrative state 
unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch now write countless rules with the force of law and arbitrarily punish individuals who disobey those rules 
the constitution makes clear that these powers were granted to congress by the people and must therefore remain solely with the peoples elected representatives 
we call on congress to begin reclaiming its constitutional powers from the bureaucratic state by requiring that major new federal regulations be approved by congress before they can take effect such as through the regulation freedom amendment 
we further affirm that courts should interpret laws as written by congress rather than allowing executive agencies to rewrite those laws to suit administration priorities 
traditional marriage and family based on marriage between one man and one woman is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values 
we condemn the supreme courts ruling in united states v windsor which wrongly removed the ability of congress to define marriage policy in federal law 
we also condemn the supreme courts lawless ruling in obergefell v hodges which in the words of the late justice antonin scalia was a judicial putsch full of silly extravagances that reduced the disciplined legal reasoning of john marshall and joseph storey to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie 
in obergefell five unelected lawyers robbed million americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman 
the court twisted the meaning of the fourteenth amendment beyond recognition 
to echo scalia we dissent 
we therefore support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power 
and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions 
the bill of rights lists religious liberty with its rights of conscience as the first freedom to be protected 
religious freedom in the bill of rights protects the right of the people to practice their faith in their everyday lives 
as george washington taught religion and morality are indispensable supports to a free society 
similarly thomas jefferson declared that no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority 
ongoing attempts to compel individuals businesses and institutions of faith to transgress their beliefs are part of a misguided effort to undermine religion and drive it from the public square 
as a result many charitable religious institutions that have demonstrated great success in helping the needy have been barred from receiving government grants and contracts 
government officials threaten religious colleges and universities with massive fines and seek to control their personnel decisions 
places of worship for the first time in our history have reason to fear the loss of taxexempt status 
merely for espousing and practicing traditional religious beliefs that have been held across the world for thousands of years and for almost four centuries in america 
we value the right of americas religious leaders to preach and americans to speak freely according to their faith 
republicans believe the federal government specifically the irs is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs 
and therefore we urge the repeal of the johnson amendment 
we pledge to defend the religious beliefs and rights of conscience of all americans 
and to safeguard religious institutions against government control 
we endorse the first amendment defense act republican legislation in the house and senate which will bar government discrimination against individuals and businesses for acting on the belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman 
this act would protect the nonprofit tax status of faithbased adoption agencies 
the accreditation of religious educational institutions 
the grants and contracts of faithbased charities and small businesses 
and the licensing of religious professions 
all of which are under assault by elements of the democratic party 
we encourage every state to pass similar legislation 
we likewise endorse the efforts of republican state legislators and governors who have defied intimidation from corporations and the media in defending religious liberty 
we support laws to confirm the longstanding american tradition that religious individuals and institutions can educate young people receive government benefits and participate in public debates without having to check their religious beliefs at the door 
our first amendment rights are not given to us by the government but are rights we inherently possess 
the government can not use subsequent amendments to limit first amendment rights 
the free exercise clause is both an individual and a collective liberty protecting a right to worship god according to the dictates of conscience 
therefore we strongly support the freedom of americans to act in accordance with their religious beliefs 
not only in their houses of worship but also in their everyday lives 
we support the right of the people to conduct their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs 
and condemn public officials who have proposed boycotts against businesses that support traditional marriage 
we pledge to protect those business owners who have been subjected to hate campaigns threats of violence and other attempts to deny their civil rights 
we support the public display of the ten commandments as a reflection of our history and our countrys judeochristian heritage 
and further affirm the rights of religious students to engage in voluntary prayer at public school events and to have equal access to school facilities 
we assert the first amendment right of freedom of association for religious private service and youth organizations to set their own membership standards 
the rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box 
freedom of speech includes the right to devote resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports 
we oppose any restrictions or conditions that would discourage citizens from participating in the public square or limit their ability to promote their ideas 
such as requiring private organizations to publicly disclose their donors to the government 
limits on political speech serve only to protect the powerful and insulate incumbent officeholders 
we support repeal of federal restrictions on political parties in mccainfeingold 
raising or repealing contribution limits 
protecting the political speech of advocacy groups corporations and labor unions 
and protecting political speech on the internet 
we likewise call for an end to the socalled fairness doctrine 
and support freemarket approaches to free speech unregulated by government 
we believe the forced funding of political candidates through union dues and other mandatory contributions violates the first amendment 
just as americans have a first amendment right to devote resources to favored candidates or views they have a first amendment right not to be forced to individually support individuals or ideologies that they oppose 
we agree with thomas jefferson that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical 
we uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms a natural inalienable right that predates the constitution and is secured by the second amendment 
lawful gun ownership enables americans to exercise their godgiven right of selfdefense for the safety of their homes their loved ones and their communities 
we salute the republican congress for defending the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the president from installing a new liberal majority on the supreme court 
the confirmation to the court of additional antigun justices would eviscerate the second amendments fundamental protections 
already local officials in the nations capital and elsewhere are defying the courts decisions upholding an individual right to bear arms as affirmed by the supreme court in heller and mcdonald 
we support firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of lawabiding americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all states 
we support constitutional carry statutes and salute the states that have passed them 
we oppose illconceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle 
we also oppose any effort to deprive individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without due process of law 
we condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers and the current administrations illegal harassment of firearm dealers 
we oppose federal licensing or registration of lawabiding gun owners registration of ammunition and restoration of the illfated clinton gun ban 
we call for a thorough investigation by a new republican administration of the deadly fast and furious operation perpetrated by department of justice officials who approved and allowed illegal sales of guns to known violent criminals 
affirming the fourth amendment right of the people to be secure in their houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
we call for strict limitations on the use of aerial surveillance on us soil 
with the exception of patrolling our national borders for illegal entry and activity 
we oppose any attempts by government to require surveillance devices in our daily lives including tracking devices in motor vehicles 
in recent years technology companies have responded to market demand for products and services that protect the privacy of customers through increasingly sophisticated encryption technology 
these increased privacy protections have become crucial to the digital economy 
at the same time however such innovations have brought new dangers especially from criminals and terrorists who seek to use encryption technology to harm us 
no matter the medium citizens must retain the right to communicate with one another free from unlawful government intrusion 
it will not be easy to balance privacy rights with the governments legitimate need to access encrypted information 
this issue is too important to be left to the courts 
a republican president and a republican congress must listen to the american people and forge a consensus solution 
the foreign account tax compliance act fatca and the foreign bank and asset reporting requirements result in governments warrantless seizure of personal financial information without reasonable suspicion or probable cause 
americans overseas should enjoy the same rights as americans residing in the united states whose private financial information is not subject to disclosure to the government except as to interest earned 
the requirement for all banks around the world to provide detailed information to the irs about american account holders outside the united states has resulted in banks refusing service to them 
thus fatca not only allows unreasonable search and seizures but also threatens the ability of overseas americans to lead normal lives 
we call for its repeal and for a change to residencybased taxation for us citizens overseas 
the constitutions guarantee that no one can be deprived of life liberty or property deliberately echoes the declaration of independences proclamation that all are endowed by their creator with the inalienable right to life 
accordingly we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which can not be infringed 
we support a human life amendment to the constitution and legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to children before birth 
we oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations like planned parenthood 
so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare 
we urge all states and congress to make it a crime to acquire transfer or sell fetal tissues from elective abortions for research 
and we call on congress to enact a ban on any sale of fetal body parts 
in the meantime we call on congress to ban the practice of misleading women on socalled fetal harvesting consent forms a fact revealed by a investigation 
we will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage 
we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life 
we oppose the nonconsensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment including food and water from individuals with disabilities newborns the elderly or the infirm just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide 
we affirm our moral obligation to assist rather than penalize women who face an unplanned pregnancy 
in order to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose life 
we support legislation that requires financial responsibility for the child be equally borne by both the mother and father upon conception until the child reaches adulthood 
failure to require a father to be equally responsible for a child places an inequitable burden on the mother 
creating a financial and social hardship on both mother and child 
we celebrate the millions of americans who open their hearts homes and churches to mothers in need and women fleeing abuse 
we thank and encourage providers of counseling medical services and adoption assistance for empowering women experiencing an unintended pregnancy to choose life 
we support funding for ultrasounds and adoption assistance 
we salute the many states that now protect women and girls through laws requiring informed consent parental consent waiting periods and clinic regulation 
we condemn the supreme courts activist decision in whole womans health v hellerstedt striking down commonsense texas laws providing for basic health and safety standards in abortion clinics 
we applaud the us house of representatives for leading the effort to add enforcement to the bornalive infant protection act by passing the bornalive abortion survivors protection act 
which imposes appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion including early induction delivery whether the death of the infant is intended 
we strongly oppose infanticide 
over a dozen states have passed paincapable unborn child protection acts prohibiting abortion after twenty weeks the point at which current medical research shows that unborn babies can feel excruciating pain during abortions and we call on congress to enact the federal version 
not only is it good legislation but it enjoys the support of a majority of the american people 
we support state and federal efforts against the cruelest forms of abortion especially dismemberment abortion procedures in which unborn babies are literally torn apart limb from limb 
we call on congress to ban sexselection abortions and abortions based on disabilities discrimination in its most lethal form 
we oppose embryonic stem cell research 
we oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research 
we support adult stem cell research and urge the restoration of the national placental stem cell bank created by president george hw bush 
but abolished by his democrat successor president bill clinton 
we oppose federal funding for harvesting embryos and call for a ban on human cloning 
the democratic party is extreme on abortion 
democrats almost limitless support for abortion and their strident opposition to even the most basic restrictions on abortion 
put them dramatically out of step with the american people 
because of their opposition to simple abortion clinic safety procedures support for taxpayerfunded abortion and rejection of pregnancy resource centers that provide abortion alternatives 
the old clinton mantra of safe legal and rare has been reduced to just legal 
we are proud to be the party that protects human life and offers real solutions for women 
the framers of our government knew from history and experience 
that when private property is not secure freedom is at risk 
that is why the fifth amendment declares that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation 
the supreme courts kelo decision undermined this safeguard by allowing local governments to seize a persons home or land not only for vital public use but also for public purpose 
which thus allowed the government to seize it for transfer to private developers or other private entities 
we call on any state legislatures that have not already done so to nullify the impact of kelo within their jurisdiction by legislation or state constitutional amendments declaring that private property may be taken only for true public use 
and we join house republicans in supporting the private property rights protection act 
the government at every level must always pay just compensation whenever it takes private property to achieve a compelling public use 
with the money coming from the budget of the agency performing the taking 
this includes the taking of water rights and the taking of property by environmental regulations that destroy or diminish the propertys value 
civil asset forfeiture was originally intended as a way to cripple organized crime through the seizure of property used in a criminal enterprise 
regrettably it has become a tool for unscrupulous law enforcement officials 
acting without due process 
to profit by destroying the livelihood of innocent individuals 
many of whom never recover the lawful assets taken from them 
when the rights of the innocent can be so easily violated no ones rights are safe 
we call on congress and state legislatures to enact reforms to protect lawabiding citizens against abusive asset forfeiture tactics 
private property includes not only physical property such as lands and homes but also intellectual property like books and patents 
article section of the constitution gives congress the power to safeguard intellectual property rights for authors and inventors 
by protecting the proprietary rights of creators and innovators the constitution promotes the general welfare by providing incentives for investment in all sorts of technology 
and artistic works 
intellectual property is a driving force in todays global economy of constant innovation 
it is the wellspring of american economic growth and job creation 
with the rise of the digital economy it has become even more critical that we protect intellectual property rights 
and preserve freedom of contract rather than create regulatory barriers to creativity growth and innovation 
protecting intellectual property is also a national security issue 
we must guard against counterfeit parts that can compromise the reliability of our weapons systems 
and the safety of military personnel 
today the worst offenses against intellectual property rights come from abroad especially in china 
we call for strong action by congress and a new republican president to enforce intellectual property laws against all infringers whether foreign or domestic 
the ninth amendment to the constitution declares that the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people 
this provision codifies the principle that our national government derives its power from the governed and that all powers not delegated to the government are retained by the people 
we call upon legislators to give full force to this fundamental principle 
we welcome to our ranks all citizens who are determined to reclaim the rights of the people that have been ignored or usurped by the federal and intrusive state governments 
federalism is a cornerstone of our constitutional system 
every violation of state sovereignty by federal officials is not merely a transgression of one unit of government against another 
it is an assault on the liberties of individual americans 
hence the promise of the tenth amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people 
the constitution gives the federal government very few powers and they are specifically enumerated 
the states and the people retain authority over all unenumerated powers 
in obedience to that principle we condemn the current administrations unconstitutional expansion into areas beyond those specifically enumerated 
including bullying of state and local governments in matters ranging from voter identification id laws to immigration from healthcare programs to land use decisions 
and from forced education curricula to school restroom policies 
we pledge to restore the proper balance and vertical separation of powers between the federal government and state governments 
the governments closest to and most reflective of the american people 
we encourage states to reinvigorate their traditional role as the laboratories of democracy 
propelling the nation forward through local and state innovation 
big government undermines federalism through more than grantsinaid programs that consume more than onesixth of the federal budget 
for matters that should be the exclusive responsibility of the states 
through these programs money originating from state taxpayers is returned to the states 
usually greatly reduced with myriad strings attached 
these grants turn state and local elected officials into agents of the federal government 
the web of conditions and regulations 
especially the requirement of matching funds that comes with federal grants 
transforms recipients into appendages of the washington bureaucracy 
we call upon congress to help a republican president to reduce and ultimately eliminate this system of conditioned grants 
so that state and local taxpayers can decide for themselves what is best for their own communities 
we oppose the national popular vote interstate compact and any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the electoral college 
an unconstitutional effort to impose national popular vote would be a grave threat to our federal system 
and a guarantee of corruption as every ballot box in every state would offer a chance to steal the presidency 
we urge state legislatures that have voted for this proposal to rescind their approval 
honest elections are the foundation of representative government 
we pledge to protect the voting rights of every citizen 
as well as their rights of conscience when they are harassed or denied a job because of their contributions to a candidate or a cause 
we support state efforts to ensure ballot access for the elderly the handicapped military personnel and all legitimate voters 
we urge state and local officials to take all appropriate steps to allow voters to cast their ballots in a timely manner 
we are concerned however that some voting procedures may be open to abuse 
for this reason we support legislation to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote and secure photo id when voting 
we strongly oppose litigation against states exercising their sovereign authority to enact such laws 
in addition to guarantee that everyones vote is counted 
we urge that electronic voting systems have a voterverified paper audit trail 
we urge every state to join the interstate voter registration cross check program to keep voter rolls accurate 
and to prevent people from voting in more than one state in the same election 
to guard against foreign involvement in our elections we call for vigilance regarding online credit card contributions to candidates and campaigns 
the members of our armed forces must not be denied the basic rights that they are defending for others 
our troops wherever stationed must be allowed to vote in a timely manner 
we call upon the entire military chain of command to ensure the voting rights of our citizen soldiers 
the constitution gives congress authority to conduct the decennial census in such manner as they shall by law direct 
in order to preserve the principle of one person one vote we urge our elected representatives to ensure that citizenship 
rather than mere residency be made the basis for the apportionment of representatives among the states 
we are the party of americas growers producers farmers ranchers foresters miners commercial fishermen 
and all those who bring from the earth the crops minerals energy and the bounties of our seas that are the lifeblood of our economy 
their labor and ingenuity their determination in bad times and love of the land at all times 
powers our economy 
creates millions of jobs 
and feeds billions of people around the world 
only a few years ago a bipartisan consensus in government valued the role of extractive industries 
and rewarded their enterprise by minimizing its interference with their work 
that has radically changed 
we look in vain within the democratic party for leaders who will speak for the people of agriculture energy and mineral production 
agricultural production and exports are central to the republican agenda for jobs growth expanded trade and prosperity 
because our farmers and ranchers care for the land 
the united states does not depend on foreign imports for sustenance 
americans spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than any other nation 
on average one american farm produces enough food to feed people 
no other nation has been as generous with food aid to the needy 
we have good reason to celebrate our domestic security in food 
we are the largest agricultural exporter in the world 
and our exports are vital for other sectors of our economy 
those exports drive additional economic growth as each dollar of agricultural exports generates another in business activity 
that is why we remain committed to expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for agriculture 
under a republican president americas trade negotiators will insist that our global trading partners adhere to sciencebased standards with regard to food and health regulations 
we will not tolerate the use of bogus science and scare tactics to bar our products from foreign markets 
nor will we allow insufficient health and safety standards for products imported for our consumption 
we must also ensure that domestic policies do not compromise our global competitiveness through overregulation and undue interference in the marketplace 
there is growing recognition that federal dairy policies crafted during the great depression are increasingly an impediment to the ability of our dairy producers to meet the expected doubling in global demand coming by 
we oppose the policies pushed by special interest groups seeking to stop or make more expensive our current system of safe efficient and humane production of meat 
congress has repeatedly had to block the current administrations draconian rules concerning the marketing of poultry and livestock 
this regulatory impulse must be curbed 
not on a casebycase basis but through a fundamental restructuring of the regulatory process 
in the meantime the intrusive and expensive federal mandates on food options and menu labeling should be ended as soon as possible by a republican congress 
we oppose the mandatory labeling of genetically modified food 
which has proven to be safe healthy and a literal lifesaver for millions in the developing world 
the democratic administrations sustained support for additional regulation of agriculture has directly resulted in higher costs of production for those who produce the food we eat 
this federal regulatory overreach has resulted and will continue to result in higher food prices for americans 
these higher food costs are particularly challenging for those americans struggling to make ends meet 
like the rest of the economy agriculture has suffered through eight years of the democrats regulatory juggernaut particularly from the environmental protection agency epa 
states not washington bureaucrats are best equipped to engage farmers and ranchers to develop sound farm oversight policies 
the epas waters of the united states wotus rule issued jointly with the army corps of engineers is a travesty 
it extends the governments jurisdiction over navigable waters into the micromanagement of puddles and ditches on farms ranches and other privatelyheld property 
ditches dry creek beds stock ponds prairie potholes and other non navigable wet areas are already regulated by the states 
wotus is now subject to judicial review and must be invalidated 
but that will not be sufficient 
unelected bureaucrats must be stopped from furthering the democratic partys political agenda through regulatory demands forced upon citizens and businesses beyond that which is required by law 
we must never allow federal agencies to seize control of state waters watersheds or groundwater 
state waters watersheds and groundwater must be the purview of the sovereign states 
farmers and ranchers are among this countrys leading conservationists 
modern farm practices and technologies 
supported by programs from the department of agriculture 
have led to reduced erosion improved water and air quality increased wildlife habitat 
all the while maintaining improved agricultural yields 
this stewardship of the land benefits everyone 
and we remain committed to conservation policies based on the preservation not the restriction of working lands 
for this reason ranching on public lands must be fostered developed and encouraged 
this includes providing for an abundant water supply for americas farmers ranchers and their communities 
farming and ranching remain highrisk endeavors and they can not be isolated from market forces 
no segment of agriculture can expect treatment so favorable that it seriously disadvantages workers in other trades 
federal programs to assist farmers in managing risk must be as costeffective as they are functional 
offering tools that can improve producers ability to operate when times are tough 
while remaining affordable to the taxpayers 
even so the expansion of agricultural exports through the vigorous opening of new markets around the world is the surest path to farm security 
while uncertainty about natural weather and markets is a risk farmers and ranchers always face 
government should not add to their uncertainty by inaction and delay 
thanks in large part to a lack of leadership from the current administration and congressional democrats 
the last farm bill took far too long to enact 
creating instability about farm policy for nearly two years 
republicans are dedicated to leading this country forward 
which includes getting things done on time including the next farm bill 
the democrats play politics with farm security 
much of the democrats delay had nothing to do with the vital role of american agriculture 
it concerned their efforts to expand welfare through the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap 
which now comprises more than percent of all farm bill spending 
during the last eight years of a democratic administration nearly all the work requirements for ablebodied adults instituted by our landmark welfare reform of have been removed 
we will restore those provisions 
and to correct a mistake made when the food stamp program was first created in separate the administration of snap from the department of agriculture 
like all other sectors of our society agriculture is directly impacted by the constant advance in technology 
agriculture now faces a revolution in the generation of big data 
information produced not only through public oversight of regulations and programs 
but also from private business records of farming and ranching operations 
in the interest of protecting the safety of our farmers and ranchers we will advance policies to protect the security privacy and most of all the private ownership of individual farmers and ranchers data 
the u s forest service within the department of agriculture controls around million acres of land with enormous natural resources 
especially timber a renewable resource providing jobs for thousands of workers 
that should be used to the best economic potential for the nation 
many of our national forests are in worsening health with the threat of invasive species insect mortality and the severe risk of wildfire 
the increase in catastrophic wildfires has been needlessly killing millions of animals and destroying homes and watersheds for decades in the western states 
the expense to suppress wildfires related to failed federal forest policies continues to increase 
when timber is managed properly the renewable crops will result in fewer wildfires 
and at the same time produce jobs in the timber industry for countless families 
we believe in promoting active sustainable management of our forests 
and that states can best manage our forests to improve forest health and keep communities safe 
our country has greater energy resources than any other place on earth 
our engineers and miners the men and women whose labor taps the forces of nature are the best in the world 
together the people of americas energy sector provide us with power that is clean affordable secure and abundant 
their work can guarantee the nations energy security for centuries to come 
if instead of erecting roadblocks 
government facilitates the creation of an alloftheabove energy strategy 
we applaud congressional republicans for doing just that through farsighted legislation 
both houses have passed bills that will modernize pipelines and the electric grid 
protect the grid from disruption 
expedite energy exports 
and lower energy costs 
a republican administration will build on those policies to find new ways to store electricity a breakthrough of extraordinary import 
planning for our energy future requires us to first determine what resources we have in reserve 
thirty years ago the worlds estimated reserves of oil were billion barrels 
today that figure is trillion barrels 
the more we know what we will have in the future the better we can decide how to use it 
that is why we support the opening of public lands and the outer continental shelf to exploration and responsible production 
even if these resources will not be immediately developed 
because we believe states can best promote economic growth while protecting the environment 
congress should give authority to state regulators to manage energy resources on federally controlled public lands within their respective borders 
the democratic partys energy policy can be summed up in a slogan currently popular among its activists keep it in the ground 
keeping energy in the earth will keep jobs out of reach of those who need them most 
for lowincome americans expensive energy means colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer 
less mobility in employment 
and higher food prices 
the current administration and particularly its epa seems not to care 
its clean power plan the centerpiece of the presidents war on coal has been stayed by the supreme court 
we will do away with it altogether 
the democratic party does not understand that coal is an abundant clean affordable reliable domestic energy resource 
those who mine it and their families should be protected 
from the democratic partys radical anticoal agenda 
the democratic partys campaign to smother the us energy industry takes many forms 
but the permitting process may be its most damaging weapon 
it takes an average of days for states to permit an oil or gas well 
it takes the federal government longer than seven months 
three decades ago the bureau of land management blm leased million acres 
in it leased only onetenth of that number 
our nuclear industry cleanly generating almost percent of our electricity from its plants has a remarkable safety record 
but only a handful of plants have been permitted in over three decades 
permitting for a safe nonpolluting hydroelectric facility 
even one that is being relicensed can take many years because of the current presidents hostility to dams 
the keystone pipeline has become a symbol of everything wrong with the current administrations ideological approach 
after years of delay the president killed it to satisfy environmental extremists 
we intend to finish that pipeline and others as part of our commitment to north american energy security 
government should not play favorites among energy producers 
the taxpayers will not soon forget the current administrations subsidies to companies that went bankrupt without producing a kilowatt of energy 
the same administration now requires the department of defense operating with slashed budgets during a time of expanding conflict to use its scarce resources to generate percent of its electricity from renewables by 
climate change is far from this nations most pressing national security issue 
this is the triumph of extremism over common sense and congress must stop it 
we support the development of all forms of energy that are marketable in a free economy without subsidies including coal oil natural gas nuclear power and hydropower 
a federal judge has struck down the blms rule on hydraulic fracturing and we support upholding this decision 
we respect the states proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing methane emissions and horizontal drilling 
and we will end the administrations disregard of the nuclear waste policy act with respect to the longterm storage of nuclear waste 
we encourage the costeffective development of renewable energy sources wind solar biomass biofuel geothermal and tidal energy 
by private capital 
the united states is overwhelmingly dependent on china and other nations for rare earth and other hardrock minerals 
these minerals are critical to advanced technology 
renewable energy 
and defense manufacturing 
we support expediting the permitting process for mineral production on public lands 
we support lifting restrictions to allow responsible development of nuclear energy 
including research into alternative processes like thorium nuclear energy 
we oppose any carbon tax 
it would increase energy prices across the board 
hitting hardest at the families who are already struggling to pay their bills in the democrats nogrowth economy 
we urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas 
american energy producers should be free to export their product to foreign markets 
this is particularly important because of international demand for liquefied natural gas and we must expedite the energy export terminals currently blocked by the administration 
energy exports will create high paying jobs throughout the united states 
reduce our nations trade deficit 
grow our economy 
and boost the energy security of our allies and trading partners 
we remain committed to aggressively expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for american energy through multilateral and bilateral agreements 
whether current pending or negotiated in the future 
energy is both an economic and national security issue 
we support the enactment of policies to increase domestic energy production 
including production on public lands 
to counter market manipulation by opec and other nationally owned oil companies 
this will reduce americas vulnerability to energy price volatility 
conservation is inherent in conservatism 
as the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago the republican party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards of the godgiven natural beauty and resources of our country 
we believe that people are the most valuable resources 
and that human health and safety are the proper measurements of a policys success 
we assert that private ownership has been the best guarantee of conscientious stewardship 
while some of the worst instances of degradation have occurred under government control 
poverty not wealth is the gravest threat to the environment 
while steady economic growth brings the technological advances which make environmental progress possible 
the environment is too important to be left to radical environmentalists 
they are using yesterdays tools to control a future they do not comprehend 
the environmental establishment has become a selfserving elite 
stuck in the mindset of the s 
subordinating the publics consensus to the goals of the democratic party 
their approach is based on shoddy science scare tactics and centralized commandandcontrol regulation 
over the last eight years the administration has triggered an avalanche of regulation that wreaks havoc across our economy 
and yields minimal environmental benefits 
the central fact of any sensible environmental policy is that year by year the environment is improving 
our air and waterways are much healthier than they were a few decades ago 
as a nation we have drastically reduced pollution 
mainstreamed recycling 
educated the public 
and avoided ecological degradation 
even if no additional controls are added air pollution will continue to decline for the next several decades due to technological turnover of aging equipment 
these successes become a challenge for democratic party environmental extremists who must reach farther and demand more to sustain the illusion of an environmental crisis 
that is why they routinely ignore costs exaggerate benefits 
and advocate the breaching of constitutional boundaries by federal agencies to impose environmental regulation 
at the same time the environmental establishment looks the other way when environmental degradation is caused by the epa and other federal agencies as was the case during the animas river spill 
our agenda is high on job creation 
expanding opportunity 
and providing a better chance at life for everyone willing to work for it 
our modern approach to environmentalism is directed to that end 
and it starts with dramatic change in official washington 
we propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states 
and to transform the epa into an independent bipartisan commission similar to the nuclear regulatory commission with structural safeguards against politicized science 
we will strictly limit congressional delegation of rulemaking authority 
and require that citizens be compensated for regulatory takings 
we will put an end to the legal practice known as sue and settle in which environmental groups sue federal agencies whose officials are complicit in the litigation so that with the taxpayers excluded both parties can reach agreement behind closed doors 
that deceit betrays the publics trust it will no longer be tolerated 
we will also reform the equal access to justice act to cap and disclose payments made to environmental activists 
and return the act to its original intent 
we will enforce the original intent of the clean water act not its distortion by epa regulations 
we will likewise forbid the epa to regulate carbon dioxide something never envisioned when congress passed the clean air act 
we will restore to congress the authority to set the national ambient air quality standards 
and modernize the permitting process under the national environmental policy act so it can no longer invite frivolous lawsuits thwart sorely needed projects 
kill jobs and strangle growth 
the federal government owns or controls over million acres of land in the united states most of which is in the west 
these are public lands and the public should have access to them for appropriate activities like hunting fishing and recreational shooting 
federal ownership or management of land also places an economic burden on counties and local communities in terms of lost revenue to pay for things such as schools police and emergency services 
it is absurd to think that all that acreage must remain under the absentee ownership or management of official washington 
congress shall immediately pass universal legislation providing for a timely and orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled public lands to states 
we call upon all national and state leaders and representatives to exert their utmost power and influence to urge the transfer of those lands identified in the review process to all willing states for the benefit of the states and the nation as a whole 
the residents of state and local communities know best how to protect the land where they work and live 
they practice bootson theground conservation in their states every day 
and to further require the approval of the state where a national monument is designated or a national park is proposed 
there is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction 
however the endangered species act esa should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country 
to upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities 
we must ensure that this protection is done effectively reasonably and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources 
the esa should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science 
and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance 
and the rights of property owners 
instead over the last few decades the esa has stunted economic development 
halted the construction of projects 
burdened landowners 
and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the esa 
all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species 
for example we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse 
neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers ranchers 
and oil and gas production 
while species threatened with extinction must be protected under the esa any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner 
with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources 
information concerning a changing climate especially projections into the longrange future must be based on dispassionate analysis of hard data 
we will enforce that standard throughout the executive branch among civil servants and presidential appointees alike 
the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change is a political mechanism not an unbiased scientific institution 
its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy 
we will evaluate its recommendations accordingly 
we reject the agendas of both the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories 
no such agreement can be binding upon the united states until it is submitted to and ratified by the senate 
we demand an immediate halt to us funding for the uns framework convention on climate change unfccc in accordance with the foreign relations authorization act 
that law prohibits washington from giving any money to any affiliated organization of the united nations which grants palestinians membership as a state 
there is no ambiguity in that language 
it would be illegal for the president to follow through on his intention to provide millions in funding for the unfccc and hundreds of millions for its green climate fund 
we firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of new technologies 
not through topdown commandandcontrol regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs 
founding father and constitution framer james wilson declared that in america the people are the masters of government but that in other countries the government is master of the people 
we pledge to make government work for the people rather than the other way around 
much of what the federal government does can be improved 
much should be replaced 
and much needs to be done away with or returned to the states 
it is long past time for just tinkering around the edges of a bloated and unresponsive bureaucratic state 
its poorly managed programs some begun generations ago are illsuited to meet present needs and future requirements 
its credit card budgets impose massive indebtedness on every american today 
and on children yet unborn 
the more it intrudes into every aspect of american life the more it alienates the citizens who work pay taxes and wonder what has happened to the country they love 
we agree with thomas jefferson that the multiplication of public offices increase of expense beyond income growth and entailment of a public debt are indications soliciting the employment of the pruning knife 
the federal fiscal burden threatens the security 
liberty 
and independence of our nation 
the current administrations refusal to work with republicans took our national debt from trillion to nearly trillion today 
left unchecked it will hit trillion by 
at the same time the administrations policies systematically crippled economic growth and job creation 
driving up government costs and driving down revenues 
when congressional republicans tried to reverse course the administration manufactured fiscal crises phony government shutdowns 
to demand excessive spending 
the administrations demands have focused on significantly expanding government spending and benefits for its preferred groups 
paid for through loans that our children and grandchildren will have to pay 
this is the path to bankrupting the next generation 
the republican path to fiscal sanity and economic expansion begins with a constitutional requirement for a federal balanced budget 
we will fight for congress to adopt and for the states to ratify a balanced budget amendment 
which imposes a cap limiting spending to the appropriate historical average percentage of our nations gross domestic product 
while requiring a supermajority for any tax increase 
with exceptions only for war or legitimate emergencies 
only a constitutional safeguard such as this can prevent deficits from mounting to government default 
republican budgets will prioritize thrift over extravagance 
and put taxpayers first 
we support the following test is a particular expenditure within the constitutional scope of the federal government 
if not stop it 
has it been effective in the past and is it still absolutely necessary 
if not end it 
is it so important as to justify borrowing especially foreign borrowing to fund it 
if not kill it 
more than million americans depend on medicare or medicaid for their healthcare 
with our population aging that number will increase 
to preserve medicare and medicaid the financing of these important programs must be brought under control 
before they consume most of the federal budget 
including national defense 
the good news is that it can be done 
and it can be done without endangering the elderly and the needy who depend on those programs 
we intend to save medicare by modernizing it 
empowering its participants 
and putting it on a secure financial footing 
we will preserve the promise of medicaid as well by making that program designed for medicine a vehicle for good health in an entirely new era 
medicares longterm debt is in the trillions 
and it is funded by a workforce that is shrinking relative to the size of future beneficiaries 
obamacare worsened the situation 
and imperiled seniors 
by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to medicare providers to pay for its new spending 
when a vital program is so clearly headed for a train wreck its time to put it on a more secure track 
that is why we propose these reforms impose no changes for persons or older 
give others the option of traditional medicare or transition to a premiumsupport model designed to strengthen patient choice 
promote costsaving competition among providers 
and better guard against the fraud and abuse that now diverts billions of dollars every year away from patient care 
guarantee to every enrollee an incomeadjusted contribution toward a plan of their choice with catastrophic protection 
without disadvantaging present retirees or those nearing retirement 
a more realistic age for eligibility in light of todays longer life span 
this is an agenda to improve healthcare 
not just to manage its costs 
we reject the democrats approach of rationing inherent in obamacare 
we recognize the de facto rationing of healthcare caused by reduced access to doctors who increasingly opt out of participating in medicare and medicaid 
we will not accept that or any other approach which denies care or lowers its quality for americas elderly 
medicaid presents related but somewhat different challenges 
as the dominant force in the health market with regard to longterm care births and persons with mental illness it is the next frontier of welfare reform 
it is simply too big and too flawed to be administered from washington 
most of the vaunted expansion of health insurance coverage under obamacare actually has been an unprecedented expansion of the medicaid rolls in many states 
we applaud the republican governors and state legislators who have undertaken the hard work of modernizing medicaid 
we will give them a free hand to do so by blockgranting the program without strings 
their initiatives whether premium supports for purchasing insurance 
refundable tax credits 
alternatives to hospitalization for chronic patients 
disease prevention activities 
and other innovations 
are the best strategy for preserving medicaid for those who need it the most 
block granting medicaid is particularly needed to address mental health care 
mental illness affects people from all walks of life 
but there has been little success in developing effective systemwide medical models for addressing mental health 
for a variety of unique reasons government is often the first frontier for people experiencing mental health problems 
from first responders who deal with crises 
to publicly funded mental health facilities 
and prisons where large numbers of inmates suffer from mental illnesses 
using block grants would allow states to experiment with different systems to address mental health 
and develop successful models to be replicated in states across the nation 
the current federally dictated mental health care regime is wasteful and ineffective 
and moving to a block grant approach would allow for state and local governments to create solutions for individuals and families in desperate need of help in addressing mental illness 
we respect the states authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children 
we reject the old maxim that social security is the third rail of american politics deadly for anyone who would change it 
the democratic party still treats it that way even though everyone knows that its current course will lead to a financial and social disaster 
younger americans have lost all faith in the program and expect little return for what they are paying into it 
as the party of americas future we accept the responsibility to preserve and modernize a system of retirement security forged in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most americans 
current retirees and those close to retirement can be assured of their benefits 
of the many reforms being proposed all options should be considered to preserve social security 
as republicans we oppose tax increases 
and believe in the power of markets to create wealth and to help secure the future of our social security system 
saving social security is more than a challenge 
it is our moral obligation to those who trusted in the governments word 
the survival of the internet as we know it is at risk 
its gravest peril originates in the white house the current occupant of which has launched a campaign both at home and internationally to subjugate it to agents of government 
the president ordered the chair of the supposedly independent federal communications commission to impose upon the internet rules devised in the s for the telephone monopoly 
he has unilaterally announced americas abandonment of the international internet 
by surrendering us control of the root zone of web names and addresses 
he threw the internet to the wolves 
and they russia china iran and others are ready to devour it 
we salute the congressional republicans who have legislatively impeded his plans to turn over the information freedom highway to regulators and tyrants 
that fight must continue for its outcome is in doubt 
we will consistently support internet policies that allow people and private enterprise to thrive 
without providing new and expanded government powers to tax and regulate 
so that the internet does not become the vehicle for a dramatic expansion of government power 
the internets independence is its power 
it has unleashed innovation enabled growth 
and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history 
we will therefore resist any effort to shift control toward governance by international or other intergovernmental organizations 
we will ensure that personal data receives full constitutional protection from government overreach 
the only way to safeguard or improve these systems is through the private sector 
the internets free market needs to be free and open to all ideas and competition without the government or service providers picking winners and losers 
our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice 
we welcome all to the great opportunity party 
the greatest asset of the american economy is the american worker 
our immigration system must protect american working families and their wages 
for citizens and legal immigrants alike 
in a way that will improve the economy 
just as immigrant labor helped build our country in the past 
todays legal immigrants are making vital contributions in every aspect of national life 
their industry and commitment to american values strengthens our economy 
enriches our culture 
and enables us to better understand and more effectively compete with the rest of the world 
we are particularly grateful to the thousands of new legal immigrants many of them not yet citizens who are serving in the armed forces and among first responders 
their patriotism should encourage all to embrace the newcomers legally among us 
assist their journey to full citizenship 
and help their communities avoid isolation from the mainstream of society 
we are also thankful for the many legal immigrants who continue to contribute to american society 
to that end we both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues 
and support english as the nations official language 
a unifying force essential for the advancement of immigrant communities and our nation as a whole 
americas immigration policy must serve the national interest of the united states 
and the interests of american workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs 
with all our fellow citizens we have watched in anger and disgust the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation 
we stand with the victims of his policies 
especially the families of murdered innocents 
illegal immigration endangers everyone 
exploits the taxpayers 
and insults all who aspire to enter america legally 
we oppose any form of amnesty for those who by breaking the law have disadvantaged those who have obeyed it 
the executive amnesties of and are a direct violation of federal law and usurp the powers of congress as outlined in article i of the constitution 
these unlawful amnesties must be immediately rescinded by a republican president 
in a time of terrorism drug cartels human trafficking and criminal gangs 
the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this country poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the united states 
our highest priority therefore must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry 
and to enforce our immigration laws 
that is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry 
the border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border 
and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic 
we insist upon workplace enforcement of verification systems 
so that more jobs can be available to all legal workers 
use of the everify program an internetbased system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees must be made mandatory nationwide 
we reaffirm our endorsement of the save program systematic alien verification for entitlements to ensure that public funds are not given to persons not legally present in this country 
we demand tough penalties against those who engage in identity theft deal in fraudulent documents and traffic in human beings 
the department of homeland security must use its authority to keep dangerous aliens off our streets 
and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens 
gang membership should be a deportable offense 
any previously deported illegal alien who continues to show a lack of respect for our borders and rule of law must be penalized 
this is why we support stiffer penalties such as a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for any illegal alien who illegally reenters our nation after already having been deported 
because sanctuary cities violate federal law and endanger their own citizens they should not be eligible for federal funding 
using state licenses to reward people in the country illegally is an affront to the rule of law and must be halted 
in light of both current needs and historic practice we urge the reform of our guest worker programs to eliminate fraud 
improve efficiency 
and ensure they serve the national interest 
in light of the alarming levels of unemployment and underemployment in this country 
it is indefensible to continue offering lawful permanent residence to more than one million foreign nationals every year 
the supreme court has correctly recognized that states have the constitutional authority to take steps to reduce illegal immigration 
we condemn the obama administrations lawsuits against states that are seeking to reinforce federal law 
we support the right of the states to enact laws deterring illegal aliens from residing within their states 
from its beginning our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum 
that should continue 
but with major changes 
asylum should be limited to cases of political ethnic or religious persecution 
as the director of the fbi has noted it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees 
to ensure our national security refugees who can not be carefully vetted can not be admitted to the country 
especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism 
we intend to restore the treaty system specified by the constitution the president negotiates agreements submits them to the senate with ratification requiring twothirds of the senators present and voting 
this was good enough for george washington but is too restrictive for the current chief executive 
who presumes to bind this country to bilateral and multilateral agreements of his devising 
his media admirers portray his personal commitments whether on climate change iranian weapons or other matters as done deals 
they are not and a new republican executive will work with the congress to reestablish constitutional order in americas foreign relations 
all international executive agreements and political arrangements entered into by the current administration must be deemed null and void as mere expressions of the current presidents preferences 
those which are in the national interest but would traditionally have been made by treaty must be abrogated renegotiated as treaties and transmitted to the senate for its advice and consent as required by the constitution 
the united states will withdraw from all agreements and arrangements failing those standards 
many good civil servants work at the irs but the agency itself is toxic 
its leadership employs known tax delinquents 
rehires workers previously fired for misconduct 
spends user fees without congressional oversight 
and awards bonuses for customer service that would put any private company out of business 
worst of all the irs has become an ideological attack dog for the worst elements of todays democratic party 
it systematically targets conservative prolife and libertarian organizations 
harassing them with repeated audits and denying their tax exempt status 
its commissioner has lied to congress hidden evidence and stonewalled investigations 
he should be impeached by the house of representatives and convicted by the senate 
we value the right of americas churches pastors and religious leaders to preach and speak freely according to their faith 
republicans believe the federal government specifically the irs is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring the speech of americas churches pastors and religious leaders 
we support repeal of the johnson amendment which restricts first amendment freedoms of all nonprofit organizations by prohibiting political speech 
we also support making the federal tax code so simple and easy to understand that the irs becomes obsolete and can be abolished 
no major part of the department of defense has ever passed an audit 
republican leaders in congress have called for a full financial audit of the pentagon to ensure that every dollar spent is truly benefitting our national security 
every taxpayer must be prepared to pass an audit and we urge congress to demand the same level of accountability from the pentagon and the department of defense 
we recognize the dedication of most employees of the federal government and thank them for their service 
with special praise for the whistleblowers who risk their careers to expose waste fraud and misuse of power 
none of them should ever be compelled to join a union or pay dues to it 
in fairness to their fellow workers union representatives should not be allowed to engage in unionrelated activities while on the publics time 
the inability of federal managers to discipline and if necessary dismiss problem staff members is an affront to every conscientious worker 
as is the misuse of funds for lavish conferences and routine bonuses 
the appointees of a republican president will work with career managers to end those abuses and enforce high standards for all federal employees 
we reaffirm the existing protections that provide all employees of the federal government the opportunity to pursue their desire to serve their country free from discrimination 
we call for renewed efforts to reduce rather than expand government responsibilities 
and we urge particular attention to the bloated public relations budgets of the departments and agencies 
the federal government spends too much of the peoples money telling the people what they should do 
our national platform has repeatedly endorsed term limits for members of congress 
in response the gop leadership in brought to a vote in both the house and senate a constitutional amendment 
it failed to secure the necessary twothirds vote in the house where percent of republicans voted for it 
and percent of democrats voted against it 
every senate republican voted to allow a vote on term limits 
but the democrats killed it by a filibuster 
blocked by that opposition republicans sought other ways to modernize the national legislature 
they set term limits for their own committee chairs and leadership positions 
and by law they required congress to live by the same rules it imposes on others 
to make further progress to advance a constitutional amendment for consideration by the states we must expand the current republican majorities in both chambers 
overregulation is the quiet tyranny of the nanny state 
it hamstrings american businesses and hobbles economic growth 
the great recession may be over but in the experience of most americans the economy is still sick 
the federal regulatory burden has been a major contributor to that stagnation 
the ability of the american people to govern themselves has been undermined by a vast array of agencies with sweeping power to regulate every aspect of american life 
they legislate as if they were congress 
they decide guilt and issue penalties as if they were courts 
they collectively impose many billions of dollars in costs to the economy 
the current president and his allies on capitol hill have used those agencies as a superlegislature 
disregarding the separation of powers to declare as law what they could not push through the congress 
the environmental protection agency has rewritten laws to advance the democrats climate change agenda 
the department of health and human services has ignored the enacted text of the affordable care act to do whatever it wants in healthcare 
both the department of labor and national labor relations board have scrapped decades of labor law to implement the agenda of big labor 
the doddfrank law the democrats legislative godzilla is crushing small and community banks and other lenders 
the federal communications commission is imperiling the freedom of the internet 
we support reinstating the glasssteagall act of which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in highrisk investment 
sensible regulations can be compatible with a vibrant economy 
they can prevent the strong from exploiting the weak 
right now the regulators are exploiting everyone 
we are determined to make regulations minimally intrusive 
confined to their legal mandate 
and respectful toward the creation of new and small businesses 
we will revisit existing laws that delegate too much authority to regulatory agencies and review all current regulations for possible reform or repeal 
we endorse republican legislation already passed by the house to require approval by both houses of congress for any rule or regulation that would impose significant costs on the american people 
further congress should work towards legislation that requires removal of a regulation of equal or greater economic burden when a new regulation is enacted 
because regulations are just another tax on the consumers congress should consider a regulatory budget that would cap the costs federal agencies could impose on the economy in any given year 
cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state 
when government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system 
by enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats 
it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism 
it is the enemy of reform in education 
the workplace 
and healthcare 
it gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small 
it is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law which is packed with corporate welfare 
crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks customdesigned regulations and special exemptions for favored parties 
the solyndra debacle is a perfect example 
it creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other 
by putting the weight of government behind the status quo it leads to economic stagnation 
we applaud the republican members of congress who have taken the lead in fighting crony capitalism and urge others to rally to their cause 
based on both treaty and other law the federal government has a unique governmentto government relationship with and trust responsibility for indian tribal governments american indians and alaska natives 
these obligations have not been sufficiently honored 
the social and economic problems that plague indian country have grown worse over the last several decades we must reverse that trend 
ineffective federal programs deprive american indians of the services they need 
and longterm failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself 
american indians have established elected tribal governments to carry out the public policies of the tribe administer services to its tribal member constituents and manage relations with federal state and local governments 
we respect the tribal governments as the voice of their communities and encourage federal state and local governments to heed those voices in developing programs and partnerships to improve the quality of life for american indians and their neighbors in their communities 
republicans believe that economic selfsufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges confronting indian country 
we believe that tribal governments and their communities not washington bureaucracies are best situated to craft solutions that will end systemic problems that create poverty and disenfranchisement 
just as the federal government should not burden states with regulations it should not stifle the development of resources within the reservations 
which need federal assistance to advance their commerce nationally through roads and technology 
federal and state regulations that thwart job creation must be withdrawn or redrawn so that tribal governments acting on behalf of american indians are not disadvantaged 
it is especially egregious that the democratic party has persistently undermined tribal sovereignty in order to provide advantage to union bosses in the tribal workplace 
native communities should have the same authority as state governments in labor matters so that union bosses and the national labor relations board nlrb can not undermine the authority of tribal governments 
republicans recognize that each tribe has the right of consultation before any new regulatory policy is implemented on tribal land 
to the extent possible such consultation should take place in indian country with the tribal government and its members 
before promulgating and imposing any new laws or regulations affecting trust land or members 
the federal government should encourage indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives 
and should defer to tribes to develop their own standards or standards in conjunction with state governments 
republicans reject a onesizefitsall approach to federaltribalstate partnerships and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it 
better partnerships will help us to expand economic opportunity 
deliver topflight education to future generations 
modernize and improve the indian health service to make it more responsive to local needs 
and build essential infrastructure in indian country in cooperation with tribal neighbors 
our approach is to empower american indians through tribal selfdetermination and selfgovernance policies to develop their greatest assets human resources and the rich natural resources on their lands 
without undue federal interference 
like all americans american indians want safe communities for their families 
but inadequate resources and neglect have over time allowed criminal activities to plague indian country 
to protect everyone 
and especially the most vulnerable children women and elders 
the legal system in tribal communities must provide stability and protect property rights 
everyones due process and civil rights must be safeguarded 
we support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by american indians including alaska natives and native hawaiians 
and to preserve their culture and languages that we consider to be national treasures 
lastly we recognize that american indians have responded to the call for military service in percentage numbers far greater than have other groups of americans 
we honor that commitment loyalty and sacrifice of all american indians serving in the military today and in years past 
and will ensure that all veterans and their families receive the care and respect they have earned through their loyal service to america 
throughout the history of our nation the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the territories of guam the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands american samoa the us virgin islands and puerto rico has often gone unacknowledged 
year after year the citizens quietly without fanfare send their sons and daughters into the us armed services 
we honor the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women of the territories who protect our freedom through their service in the us armed forces 
geographically the territories and commonwealths especially those in the pacific are of vital importance to our national security as the outermost line of defense and gateway to america against potential encroachment by foreign powers 
we welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process 
and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution with all the rights and responsibilities that entails 
we recognize the challenges facing all the us territories in an era of dramatic global economic change 
they need venture capital to retain existing industries and develop new ones 
a stronger private sector can reduce dependence on public employment and lead toward selfsufficiency 
their development of local energy options will be crucial to reduce dependence on costly imported fuel 
the territories economic stability and potential for growth must be considered in any trade agreements between the united states and other pacific nations 
they should be given flexibility or exemption from laws that increase costs for their populations 
such as the minimum wage 
and the jones act concerning shipping 
all unreasonable impediments to their prosperity should be removed including unreasonable us customs practices 
territories such as american samoa should be able to properly develop their resources including fishing when jobs and the economy depend on it 
we call for the appointment of a commonwealth and territories advisory committee consisting of representatives from all five us territories 
the committee will be integrated into the presidents transition team and be tasked with performing a holistic review of all federal regulations affecting the territories and commonwealths 
we further call for the appointment of a special assistant to the president responsible for daytoday interaction with the territories and commonwealths 
this position will be the direct connection for the office of insular affairs the citizens of the territories and commonwealths and the white house 
we support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state 
we further recognize the historic significance of the local referendum in which a percent majority voted to end puerto ricos current status as a us territory and percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood 
we support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an act of congress in to ascertain the aspirations of the people of puerto rico 
once the local vote for statehood is ratified congress should approve an enabling act with terms for puerto ricos future admission as the st state of the union 
the nations capital city is a special responsibility of the federal government because it belongs both to its residents and to all americans millions of whom visit it every year 
congressional republicans have fostered homeownership 
and open access to higher education for washington residents 
against the opposition of the current president and leaders of the democratic party they have established and expanded the dc opportunity scholarship program through which thousands of lowincome children have been able to attend a school of their choice and receive a quality education 
republicans have been in the forefront of combating chronic corruption among the citys top democratic officials 
we call for congressional action to enforce the spirit of the home rule act assuring minority representation on the city council 
that council backed by the current mayor is attempting to seize from the congress its appropriating power over all funding for the district 
the illegality of their action mirrors the unacceptable spike in violent crime and murders currently afflicting the city 
we expect congress to assert by whatever means necessary its constitutional prerogatives regarding the district 
since the supreme courts decisions affirming the second amendment rights of its citizens city officials have engaged in a campaign of massive resistance by denying virtually all applications for gun ownership 
the republican congress should be prepared upon the inauguration of a republican president to enact legislation allowing lawabiding washingtonians to own and carry firearms 
statehood for the district can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment 
any other approach would be invalid 
a statehood amendment was soundly rejected by the states when last proposed in and should not be revived 
we are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they create together families schools congregations neighborhoods to advance their ideals and make real their dreams 
those institutions standing between the citizen and the power of government are the pillars of a free society 
they create spaces where the power of government should not intrude 
they allow americans to work together to solve most of the problems facing their communities 
they thus reduce the need for intervention by government in the form of more and bigger programs or a larger public workforce 
they minimize decisionmaking by those who hold or are appointed to office 
that is precisely why todays progressives distrust and seek to control them because this is more than a conflict of ideas 
it is a struggle for power 
our society is at a crossroads 
for several generations an expansive federal regime has marginalized and supplanted the institutions holding our society together 
no wonder then that so much seems to be coming apart now 
the question is whether we are going to reinvigorate the private sector institutions under citizen control or allow their continued erosion by the forces of centralized social planning 
in that divide the republican party stands with the people 
foremost among those institutions is the american family 
it is the foundation of civil society 
and the cornerstone of the family is natural marriage the union of one man and one woman 
its daily lessons cooperation patience mutual respect responsibility selfreliance are fundamental to the order and progress of our republic 
strong families depending upon god and one another 
advance the cause of liberty by lessening the need for government in their daily lives 
conversely as we have learned over the last five decades the loss of faith and family life leads to greater dependence upon government 
that is why republicans formulate public policy from taxation to education from healthcare to welfare with attention to the needs and strengths of the family 
it is also why everyone should be concerned about the state of the american family today 
not because of ideology or doctrine but because of the overwhelming evidence of experience social science and common sense 
all of which give us these truths about traditional marriage children raised in a twoparent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier 
more likely to do well in school 
less likely to use drugs and alcohol 
engage in crime or become pregnant outside of marriage 
we oppose policies and laws that create a financial incentive for or encourage cohabitation 
moreover marriage remains the greatest antidote to child poverty 
the percent of children who now are born outside of marriage are five times more likely to live in poverty than youngsters born and raised by a mother and father in the home 
nearly threequarters of the billion government annually spends on welfare goes to singleparent households 
this is what it takes for a governmental village to raise a child and the village is doing a tragically poor job of it 
the data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion every child deserves a married mom and dad 
the reality remains that millions of american families do not have the advantages that come with that structure 
we honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone 
and embrace the principle that all americans should be treated with dignity and respect 
but respect is not enough 
our laws and our governments regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman 
and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society 
for that reason as explained elsewhere in this platform we do not accept the supreme courts redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal 
whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the states 
we oppose government discrimination against businesses or entities which decline to sell items or services to individuals for activities that go against their religious views about such activities 
families formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation 
private entities which facilitate adoptions enrich our communities 
we support measures such as the first amendment defense act to ensure these entities do not face government discrimination because of their views on marriage and family 
we applaud the republican initiatives which have led to an increase in adoptions an achievement which should be recognized in any restructuring of the federal tax code 
while the number of children in foster care has stabilized teens who age out of that setting often are abruptly left to face the world on their own 
we urge states and community groups to help these young adults become independent 
thirty years ago president reagan commissioned a special working group on the family to study how government at all levels could be more supportive of family life 
we urge marriage penalties to be removed from the tax code and public assistance programs 
we invite all who care about children to join us in this proposal to ensure that all federal programs in the words of president kennedy stress the integrity and preservation of the family unit 
we have been fighting the war on poverty for years and poverty is winning 
our social safety net about separate meanstested programs costing over trillion every year is designed to help people born into or falling into poverty 
it rarely lifts them out 
its apologists judge success by the amount of money spent to keep people in the system 
that is a cruel measurement 
republicans propose to evaluate a poverty program by whether it actually reduces poverty and increases the personal independence of its participants 
the results are damning intergenerational poverty has persisted and worsened since 
this year marks another important anniversary it has been years since the landmark republican welfare reform of broke away from the discredited great society model 
by making welfare a benefit instead of an entitlement it put millions of recipients on a transition from dependence to independence 
welfare rolls declined by half as recipients and prospective recipients discovered a better way to reach their goals 
best of all about million children moved out of poverty 
today that progress has been lost 
defying the law as it was plainly written the current administration has nullified any meaningful work requirement and made tanf a mockery of the name we gave it temporary assistance for needy families 
this decision ensures that those families will remain needy and cut off from the economic mainstream of american society 
this is the progressive pathology keeping people dependent so that government can redistribute income 
the result is million people on food stamps and million on medicaid plus another million in the childrens health insurance program 
this is the false compassion of the status quo 
we propose instead the dynamic compassion of work requirements in a growing economy 
where opportunity takes the place of a handout 
where true selfesteem can grow from the satisfaction of a job well done 
we call for removal of structural impediments which progressives throw in the path of poor people 
overregulation of startup enterprises 
excessive licensing requirements 
needless restrictions on formation of schools and daycare centers serving neighborhood families 
and restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few 
we will continue our fight for school choice until all parents can find good safe schools for their children 
to protect religious liberty we will ensure that faithbased institutions especially those that are vital parts of underserved neighborhoods do not face discrimination by government 
we propose new partnerships between those who manage federal programs and those who are on the front lines of fighting poverty on the ground 
we must encourage their efforts to reclaim their communities from the culture of poverty 
to advance this process we urge greater state and local responsibility for and control over public assistance programs 
education is much more than schooling 
it is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation not just knowledge and skills but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions 
it is the handing over of a cultural identity 
that is why american education has for the last several decades been the focus of constant controversy as centralizing forces from outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake america 
they have done immense damage 
the federal government should not be a partner in that effort as the constitution gives it no role in education 
at the heart of the american experiment lies the greatest political expression of human dignity 
the self evident truth that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
that truth rejects the dark view of the individual as human capital a possession for the creation of anothers wealth 
parents are a childs first and foremost educators and have primary responsibility for the education of their children 
parents have a right to direct their childrens education care and upbringing 
we support a constitutional amendment to protect that right from interference by states the federal government or international bodies such as the united nations 
we reject a one sizefitsall approach to education 
and support a broad range of choices for parents and children at the state and local level 
we likewise repeat our longstanding opposition to the imposition of national standards and assessments 
encourage the parents and educators who are implementing alternatives to common core 
and congratulate the states which have successfully repealed it 
their education reform movement calls for choicebased parentdriven accountability at every stage of schooling 
it affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations 
it recognizes the wisdom of local control of our schools 
and it wisely sees consumer rights in education choice as the most important driving force for renewing education 
it rejects excessive testing and teaching to the test 
and supports the need for strong assessments to serve as a tool so teachers can tailor teaching to meet student needs 
we applaud americas great teachers who should be protected against frivolous lawsuits 
and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom 
administrators need flexibility to innovate and to hold accountable all those responsible for student performance 
a good understanding of the bible being indispensable for the development of an educated citizenry we encourage state legislatures to offer the bible in a literature curriculum as an elective in americas high schools 
we urge school districts to make use of teaching talent in the business community stem fields and the military 
especially among our returning veterans 
rigid tenure systems should be replaced with a meritbased approach in order to attract the best talent to the classroom 
all personnel who interact with school children should pass background checks and be held to the highest standards of personal conduct 
maintaining american preeminence requires a worldclass system of education in which all students can reach their potential 
republicans are leading the effort to create it 
since the federal government through more than programs in the department of education has spent trillion on elementary and secondary education with little substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates 
the united states spends an average of more than per pupil per year in public schools for a total of more than billion 
that represents more than percent of gdp devoted to k education in 
of that amount federal spending amounted to more than billion 
clearly if money were the solution our schools would be problemfree 
more money alone does not necessarily equal better performance 
after years of trial and error we know the policies and methods that have actually made a difference in student advancement choice in education 
building on the basics 
stem subjects and phonics 
career and technical education 
ending social promotions 
merit pay for good teachers 
classroom discipline 
parental involvement 
and strong leadership by principals superintendents and locally elected school boards 
because technology has become an essential tool of learning it must be a key element in our efforts to provide every child equal access and opportunity 
we strongly encourage instruction in american history and civics by using the original documents of our founding fathers 
we support options for learning including homeschooling 
career and technical education 
private or parochial schools magnet schools charter schools online learning 
and earlycollege high schools 
we especially support the innovative financing mechanisms that make options available to all children education savings accounts esas vouchers and tuition tax credits 
empowering families to access the learning environments that will best help their children to realize their full potential is one of the greatest civil rights challenges of our time 
a young persons ability to succeed in school must be based on his or her godgiven talent and motivation not an address zip code or economic status 
we propose that the bulk of federal money through title i for lowincome children and through idea for children with special needs should follow the child to whatever school the family thinks will work best for them 
in sum on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for k public education with overall results that do not justify that spending level 
on the other hand the common experience of families teachers and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education 
in congress and in the states republicans are bridging the gap between those two realities 
congressional republicans are leading the way forward with major reform legislation advancing the concept of block grants 
and repealing numerous federal regulations which have interfered with state and local control of public schools 
their workplace innovation and opportunity act modernizing workforce programs repealing mandates and advancing employment for persons with disabilities is now law 
their legislation to require transparency in unfunded mandates imposed upon our schools is advancing 
their dc opportunity scholarship program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country 
we deplore the efforts of congressional democrats and the current president to eliminate this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers unions 
to ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of american life we support the english first approach and oppose divisive programs that limit students ability to advance in american society 
we renew our call for replacing family planning programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior 
that approach the only one always effective against premarital pregnancy and sexuallytransmitted disease empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes 
we oppose schoolbased clinics that provide referral or counseling for abortion and contraception 
and believe that federal funds should not be used in mandatory or universal mental health psychiatric or socioemotional screening programs 
the federal government has pushed states to collect and share vast amounts of personal student and family data including the collection of social and emotional data 
much of this data is collected without parental consent or notice 
this is wholly incompatible with the american experiment and our inalienable rights 
we emphatically support the original authentic meaning of title ix of the education amendments of 
it affirmed that no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 
that language opened up for girls and women a world of opportunities that had too often been denied to them 
that same provision of law is now being used by bureaucrats 
and by the current president of the united states 
to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the american people by wrongly redefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories 
their agenda has nothing to do with individual rights it has everything to do with power 
they are determined to reshape our schools and our entire society to fit the mold of an ideology alien to americas history and traditions 
their edict to the states concerning restrooms locker rooms and other facilities is at once illegal dangerous and ignores privacy issues 
we salute the several states which have filed suit against it 
sexual assault is a terrible crime 
we commend the goodfaith efforts by law enforcement educational institutions and their partners to address that crime responsibly 
whenever reported it must be promptly investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom not a faculty lounge 
questions of guilt or innocence must be decided by a judge and jury with guilt determined beyond a reasonable doubt 
those convicted of sexual assault should be punished to the full extent of the law 
the administrations distortion of title ix to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse contravenes our countrys legal traditions and must be halted before it further muddles this complex issue and prevents the proper authorities from investigating and prosecuting sexual assault effectively with due process 
our colleges universities and trade schools large and small public and private form the worlds greatest assemblage of learning 
they drive much of the research that keeps america competitive 
and by admitting large numbers of foreign students convey our values and culture to the world 
their excellence is undermined by an ideological bias deeply entrenched within the current university system 
whatever the solution may be in private institutions in state schools the trustees have a responsibility to the taxpayers 
to ensure that their enormous investment is not abused for political indoctrination 
we call on state officials to preserve our public colleges universities and trade schools as places of learning and the exchange of ideas 
not zones of intellectual intolerance or safe zones as if college students need protection from the free exchange of ideas 
a students first amendment rights do not end at the schoolhouse gates 
colleges universities and trade schools must not infringe on their freedom of speech and association in the name of political correctness 
we condemn the campusbased bds boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel 
it is antisemitism and should be denounced by advocates of academic freedom 
the cost of a college education has long been on an unsustainable trajectory rising year by year far ahead of inflation 
nationwide student debt now exceeds credit card debt with average debt levels per student totaling roughly 
delinquency rates on student loans are now as high as they were on subprime mortgages during the housing crisis 
over half of recent college grads are unemployed or underemployed working at jobs for which their expensive educations gave them no preparation 
we need new systems of learning to compete with traditional fouryear schools technical institutions online universities lifelong learning and work based learning in the private sector 
public policy should advance their affordability innovation and transparency 
and should recognize that a fouryear degree from a brickandmortar institution is not the only path toward a prosperous and fulfilling career 
the federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans 
in order to bring down college costs and give students access to a multitude of financing options private sector participation in student financing should be restored 
any regulation that increases college costs must be challenged to balance its worth against its negative economic impact on students and their families 
in order to encourage new modes of higher education delivery to enter the market accreditation should be decoupled from federal financing 
and states should be empowered to allow a wide array of accrediting and credentialing bodies to operate 
this model would foster innovation 
bring private industry into the credentialing market 
and give students the ability to customize their college experience 
any honest agenda for improving healthcare must start with repeal of the dishonestly named affordable care act of obamacare 
it weighs like the dead hand of the past upon american medicine 
it imposed a eurostyle bureaucracy to manage its unworkable budgetbusting conflicting provisions 
it has driven up prices for all consumers 
their insurance premiums have dramatically increased while their deductibles have risen about eight times faster than wages in the last ten years 
it drove up drug prices by levying a billion tax on manufacturers and importers 
and through mandated price cuts for drugs under medicare and medicaid forced pharmaceutical companies to raise prices for everyone else 
its silver plans the most common option on the government insurance exchanges limit peoples access to their own doctor through narrow networks 
and restrict drug coverage forcing many patients to pay for extremely costly medicines for their chronic diseases 
we agree with the four dissenting judges of the supreme court in our view the entire act before us is invalid in its entirety 
it must be removed and replaced with an approach based on genuine competition patient choice excellent care wellness and timely access to treatment 
to that end a republican president on the first day in office will use legitimate waiver authority under the law to halt its advance and then with the unanimous support of congressional republicans will sign its repeal 
the supreme court upheld obamacare based on congress power to tax 
it is time to repeal obamacare and give america a muchneeded tax cut 
in its place we must combine what worked best in the past with changes needed for the future 
we must recover the traditional patientphysician relationship based on mutual trust informed consent and confidentiality 
to simplify the system for both patients and providers we will reduce mandates and enable insurers and providers of care to increase healthcare options and contain costs 
our goal is to ensure that all americans have improved access to affordable highquality healthcare including those struggling with mental illness 
we will return to the states their historic role of regulating local insurance markets 
limit federal requirements on both private insurance and medicaid 
and call on state officials to reconsider the costly medical mandates imposed under their own laws that price millions of lowincome families out of the insurance market 
to guarantee firstrate care for the needy we propose to block grant medicaid and other payments and to assist all patients including those with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage in a robust consumer market 
through obamacare the current administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare 
we however affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life 
numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and wellbeing of women and we stand firmly against it 
to ensure vigorous competition in healthcare and because costawareness is the best guard against overutilization 
we will promote price transparency so consumers can know the cost of treatments before they agree to them 
we will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured 
we believe that individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous coverage should be protected from discrimination 
we applaud the advance of technology in electronic medical records 
while affirming patient privacy and ownership of personal health information 
consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform 
todays highly mobile workforce needs portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job 
the need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work 
we propose to end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines 
in light of that we propose repealing the mccarranferguson act which protects insurance companies from antitrust litigation 
we look to the growth of health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts that empower patients and advance choice in healthcare 
our aging population must have access to safe and affordable care 
because most seniors desire to age at home we will make homecare a priority in public policy and will implement programs to protect against elder abuse 
americas healthcare professionals should not be forced to choose between following their faith and practicing their profession 
we respect the rights of conscience of healthcare professionals doctors nurses pharmacists and organizations especially the faithbased groups which provide a major portion of care for the nation and the needy 
we support the ability of all organizations to provide purchase or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious moral or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty 
we support the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children 
we support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their minor children and urge enactment of legislation that would require parental consent for their daughter to be transported across state lines for abortion 
providers should not be permitted to unilaterally withhold services because a patients life is deemed not worth living 
american taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortion 
as democrats abandon this four decadeold bipartisan consensus we call for codification of the hyde amendment and its application across the government including obamacare 
we call for a permanent ban on federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage 
medical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for everyone by forcing physicians to practice defensive medicine through tests and treatments which otherwise might be optional 
rural america is especially affected as obstetricians surgeons and other providers move to urban settings or retire in the face of escalating insurance premiums 
many republican governors have advanced the legal reforms necessary to reverse that trend 
we support state and federal legislation to cap noneconomic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of higher medical bills 
american medicine is poised to enter a new era of technological advance 
federal and private investment in basic and applied biomedical research holds enormous promise especially with diseases and disorders like autism alzheimers and parkinsons 
just as we today take for granted wonders that seemed impossible a few decades ago mris and cat scans robotic surgery and in utero treatment 
patients a decade hence will have care and treatment that will make much of todays medicine look primitive 
modern miracles involving genetics the immune system cures for deadly diseases and more are in the research pipeline 
this is the consequence of marrying significant investment both public and private 
with the worlds best talent a formula that has for a century given the american people the worlds best healthcare 
we are determined that it should continue to do so especially as we confront new dangers like ebola zika chikungunya and antibioticresistant pathogens 
to continue our headway against breast and prostate cancer diabetes and other killers research must consider the needs of formerly neglected demographic groups 
we call for expanded support for the stem cell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions through adult stem cells umbilical cord blood and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells 
without the destruction of embryonic human life 
we urge a ban on human cloning for research or reproduction 
and a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research 
we applaud congress ban on the fda approval of research involving threeparent embryos 
we believe the fdas approval of mifeprex a dangerous abortifacient formerly known as ru threatens womens health 
as does the agencys endorsement of overthecounter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physicians recommendation 
we support cutting federal and state funding for entities that endanger womens health by performing abortions in a manner inconsistent with federal or state law 
the united states has led life sciences and medical innovation for decades bringing millions of highpaying jobs to our country and helping americans and people around the world live longer healthier lives 
unfortunately the continuously increasing burden of governmental regulation and red tape is taking its toll on our innovative companies and their pipeline of new lifesaving devices and drugs to our nations patients is slowing and diminishing 
the fda has slowly but relentlessly changed into an agency that more and more puts the public health at risk by delaying chilling and killing the development of new devices drugs and biologics that can promote our lives and our health 
the fda needs leadership that can reform the agency for our century and fix the lack of predictability consistency transparency 
and efficiency at the agency 
the fda needs to return to its traditional emphasis on hard science and approving new breakthrough medicines 
rather than divert its attention and consume its resources trying to overregulate electronic health records or vaping 
we pledge to restore the fda to its position as the premier scientific health agency focused on both promoting and protecting the public health in equal measure 
so we can ensure that americans live longer healthier lives 
that the united states remains the world leader in life sciences and medical innovation 
that millions of highpaying cuttingedge device and drug jobs stay in the united states 
that us patients benefit first and most from new devices and drugs 
and that the fda no longer wastes us taxpayer and innovators resources through bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty 
we commend those states that have passed right to try legislation allowing terminally ill patients the right to try investigational medicines not yet approved by the fda 
we urge congress to pass federal legislation to give all americans with terminal illnesses the right to try 
under the last two republican presidents landmark civil rights legislation affirmed the inherent rights of persons with disabilities 
republicans want to support those rights by guaranteeing access to education and the tools necessary to compete in the mainstream of society 
this is not just a moral obligation to our fellow americans with disabilities 
it is our duty to our countrys future to tap this vast pool of talented individuals who want to work and contribute to the common good 
for that reason republican leadership led to enactment of the able act achieving a better life experience and the steve gleason act 
the former for the first time lets people with disabilities maintain access to services while saving to develop assets 
the latter bearing the name of the former nfl player with als provides access to speechgenerating devices 
in addition our workforce innovation and opportunity act will make it easier for students with disabilities to pursue competitive employment 
persons with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to be selfemployed as the general population 
to encourage their entrepreneurship it makes sense to include them in the small business administrations a certification program which opens up federal contracting for emerging businesses 
any restructuring of the tax code should consider ways in which companies can benefit from the talent and energy of their disabled employees 
the individuals with disabilities education act idea has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students 
congressional republicans will lead in its reauthorization as well as renewal of the higher education act which can offer students with disabilities increased access to the general curriculum 
our time act transition to integrated and meaningful employment will modernize the fair labor standards act to encourage competitive employment for persons with disabilities 
we affirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers 
we endorse efforts like employment first that replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the american workforce 
we oppose the nonconsensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities 
including newborns the elderly and infirm 
just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide which endanger especially those on the margins of society 
we urge the drug enforcement administration to restore its ban on the use of controlled substances for physicianassisted suicide 
the men and women of law enforcement whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders 
fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror 
deserve our gratitude and support 
their jobs are never easy especially in crisis situations 
and should not be made more difficult by politicized secondguessing from federal officials 
the current administrations lack of respect for them from white house intervention in local arrests to the attorney generals present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country has been unprecedented 
with all americans we mourn those whom we have lost to violence and hatred 
to honor their sacrifice we recommit ourselves as individuals and as a party to the rule of law and the pursuit of justice 
the conduct of the department of justice has included refusal to enforce laws stonewalling congressional committees destroying evidence reckless dealing with firearms that led to several deaths on both sides of our border and defying a citation for contempt 
it has urged leniency for rioters while turning a blind eye to mob attacks on peaceful citizens exercising their political rights 
a new administration must ensure the immediate dismissal and where appropriate prosecution of any department officials who have violated their oath of office 
the next president must restore the publics trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law himself 
additionally the next president must not sow seeds of division and distrust between the police and the people they have sworn to serve and protect 
the republican party a party of law and order must make clear in words and action that every human life matters 
two grave problems undermine the rule of law on the federal level overcriminalization 
and overfederalization 
in the first case congress and federal agencies have increased the number of criminal offenses in the us code from in the early s to more than today 
that does not include an estimated regulations containing criminal penalties 
no one including the department of justice can come up with accurate numbers 
that recklessness is bad enough when committed by congress 
but when it comes from the unelected bureaucrats of the federal agencies it is intolerable 
the power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state 
to deal with this morass we urge caution in the creation of new crimes 
and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the code and the body of regulations of old crimes 
we call for mens rea elements in the definition of any new crimes to protect americans who in violating a law act unknowingly or without criminal intent 
we urge congress to codify the common laws rule of lenity which requires courts to interpret unclear statutes in favor of a defendant 
the overfederalization of criminal justice is one of many ways in which the government in washington has intruded beyond its proper jurisdiction 
the essential role of federal law enforcement personnel in protecting federal property and combating interstate crime should not be compromised by diversion to matters properly handled by state and local authorities 
we applaud the republican governors and legislators who have been implementing criminal justice reforms like those proposed by our platform 
along with diversion of firsttime nonviolent offenders to community sentencing accountability courts drug courts veterans treatment courts 
and guidance by faith based institutions with proven track records of rehabilitation 
our platform emphasized restorative justice to make the victim whole and put the offender on the right path 
as variants of these reforms are undertaken in many states we urge the congress to learn from what works 
in the past judicial discretion about sentences led to serious mistakes concerning dangerous criminals 
mandatory minimum sentencing became an important tool for keeping them off the streets 
modifications to it should be targeted toward particular categories especially nonviolent offenders and persons with drug alcohol or mental health issues 
and should require disclosure by the courts of any judicial departure from the states sentencing requirements 
the constitutionality of the death penalty is firmly settled by its explicit mention in the fifth amendment 
with the murder rate soaring in our great cities we condemn the supreme courts erosion of the right of the people to enact capital punishment in their states 
in solidarity with those who protect us we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers 
we call on the congress to make the federal courts a model for the rest of the country in protecting the rights of victims and their families 
they should be told all relevant information about their case allowed to be present for its trial assured a voice in sentencing and parole hearings given access to social and legal services and benefit from the crime victims fund established under president reagan for that sole purpose 
public officials must regain control of their correctional institutions some of which have become ethnic and racial battlegrounds 
persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates 
courts should not tie the hands of prison officials in dealing with these problems 
we encourage states to offer opportunities for literacy and vocational education to prepare prisoners for release to the community 
breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are prisoners 
deprived of a parent through no fault of their own youngsters from these families should be a special concern of our schools social services and religious institutions 
the internet must not become a safe haven for predators 
pornography with its harmful effects especially on children has become a public health crisis that is destroying the lives of millions 
we encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to childrens safety and wellbeing 
we applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation 
we urge energetic prosecution of child pornography which is closely linked to human trafficking 
the progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding 
whether for cultural reasons 
or for lack of national leadership 
in many jurisdictions marijuana is virtually legalized despite its illegality under federal law 
at the other end of the drug spectrum heroin use nearly doubled from to while deaths from heroin have quadrupled 
all this highlights the continuing conflicts and contradictions in public attitudes and public policy toward illegal substances 
congress and a new administration should consider the long range implications of these trends for public health and safety and prepare to deal with the problematic consequences 
the misuse of prescription painkillers opioids is a related problem 
heroin and opioid abuse touches our communities our homes and our families in ways that have grave effects on americans in every community 
with a quadrupling of both their sales and their overdose deaths the opioid crisis is ravaging communities all over the country 
often hitting rural areas harder than urban 
because overprescription of drugs is such a large part of the problem republican legislation now allows medicare part d and medicare advantage plans to limit patients to a single pharmacy 
congressional republicans have also called upon the centers for medicare and medicaid services to ensure that no physician will be penalized for limiting opioid prescriptions 
we look for expeditious agreement between the house and senate on the comprehensive addiction and recovery act which addresses the opioid epidemic from both the demand and supply sides of the problem 
alexander hamilton wrote in federalist that the first of the principal constitutional obligations of the federal government is to provide for the common defense of the united states and president george washington wisely reminded us that to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace 
after nearly eight years of a democratic commanderinchief who has frequently placed strategic and ideological limitations and shackles on our military 
our enemies have been emboldened and our national security is at great risk 
our country faces a national security crisis and only by electing a republican to the white house will we restore law and order to our land 
and safety to our citizens 
we are the party of peace through strength 
we believe that american exceptionalism the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership in the world 
requires the united states to retake its natural position as leader of the free world 
tyranny and injustice thrive when america is weakened 
the oppressed have no greater ally than a confident and determined united states 
backed by the strongest military on the planet 
quite simply the republican party is committed to rebuilding the us military into the strongest on earth with vast superiority over any other nation or group of nations in the world 
we face a dangerous world and we believe in a resurgent america 
in all of our countrys history there is no parallel to what president obama and his former secretary of state have done to weaken our nation 
our aging naval capabilities are inadequate for their job 
the air force fields the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft in its history 
the marines have only twothirds the number of battalions they have historically needed to meet day to day operational demands 
the army is at its lowest troop levels since before world war ii 
our us ambassador and american personnel were left without adequate security or backup halfway across the world in benghazi 
in summary we have returned to the hollow force days of jimmy carter 
also neglected are our strategic forces especially the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses 
the groundbased midcourse defense system has been delayed and underfunded 
to curry favor with russia defense installations in poland and the czech republic have been neutralized and the number of planned interceptors in alaska has been reduced 
a new start agreement strategic arms reduction treaty so weak in verification and definitions that it is virtually impossible to prove a violation has allowed russia to build up its nuclear arsenal while reducing ours 
meanwhile moscow has repeatedly violated the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty a treaty agreeing to the elimination of landbased midrange nuclear missiles with impunity covertly testing missiles banned under that agreement 
in the international arena a weak administration has invited aggression 
the results of the administrations unilateral approach to disarmament are already clear 
an emboldened china in the south china sea 
a resurgent russia occupying parts of ukraine and threatening neighbors from the baltic to the caucasus 
and an aggressive islamist terror network in the middle east 
we support maintaining and if warranted increasing sanctions together with our allies against russia unless and until ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored 
we also support providing appropriate assistance to the armed forces of ukraine and greater coordination with nato defense planning 
all our adversaries heard the message in the administrations cutbacks america is weaker and retreating 
concomitantly we honor support and thank all law enforcement first responders and emergency personnel for their service 
in the face of these threats the first order of business for a republican president and congress will be to restore our nations military might 
republicans continue to support american military superiority which has been the cornerstone of a strategy that seeks to deter aggression 
or defeat those who threaten our vital national security interests 
we must rebuild troop numbers and readiness 
and confirm their mission protecting the nation 
not nation building 
the united states should meet the reagan model of peace through strength by a force that is capable of meeting any and all threats to our vital national security 
we will no longer tolerate a president whose rules of engagement put our own troops in harms way 
or commanders who tell their soldiers that their first duty is to fight climate change 
a republican administration will begin at once to undo the damage of the last eight years 
we must move from a budgetbased strategy to one that puts the security of our nation first 
this means that our republican presidents strategic vision will include the development of a balanced force to meet the diverse threats facing our nation 
special operations forces are simply not intended to deal with the full spectrum of threats 
we need a reaganera force that can fight and win twoand onehalf wars ranging from counterterrorism to deterring major power aggressors 
we should abandon arms control treaties that benefit our adversaries without improving our national security 
we must fund develop and deploy a multilayered missile defense system 
we must modernize nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms 
end the policy of mutually assured destruction 
and rebuild relationships with our allies 
who understand that as long as the us nuclear arsenal is their shield they do not need to engage in nuclear proliferation 
while immigration is addressed in more detail elsewhere we can not ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue 
and that our nations immigration and refugee policies are placing americans at risk 
to keep our people safe we must secure our borders 
enforce our immigration laws 
and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country 
in particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the united states from terrorsponsoring countries or from regions associated with islamic terrorism 
this was done successfully after september under the national security entryexit registration system which should be renewed now 
we owe it to the american people and to those who fight our wars that we remain the strongest military on earth 
and be prepared to defeat any adversary under any circumstances on any battlefield including land air sea or cyber 
successive years of cuts to our defense budget have put an undue strain on our men and women in uniform 
this is especially harmful at a time when we are asking our military to do more in an increasingly dangerous world 
the us defense budget has suffered a percent cut in real dollars in the five years since sequestration 
we support lifting the budget cap for defense and reject the efforts of democrats to hold the militarys budget hostage for their domestic agenda 
congress and the administration should work together to approve military spending at the level necessary to defend our country 
we must not be encumbered by decades old legacy procurement processes 
americas incredible talent and ingenuity must be unleashed by modernizing the military procurement system and embracing competition among traditional and nontraditional suppliers 
competitive acquisition and maintenance of weapon systems including the sustainment and support of such systems 
will benefit the us economy 
us taxpayers 
and most important the american warfighter 
increased competition will enable new department of defense suppliers 
particularly small businesses to participate in the defense sector 
that will promote new demand for skilledlabor jobs 
while making the departments procurement more costefficient 
the increased agility and effectiveness will ensure that our troops are equipped with the right resources more quickly than our current procurement systems allow 
with republican leadership the congress recently passed legislation that begins to reverse americas military decline 
the national defense authorization act of begins to correct the shortfalls in our military readiness by reversing troop cuts increasing investments in training and maintenance and rebuilding facilities 
it gives our troops the full pay raise to which they are entitled under the law 
and gives the next administration the ability to review operations and funding make adjustments and ask for more money if necessary 
all this represents a sound start in supporting those who put their lives on the line in defense of our country 
while protecting our national security in a dangerous world 
military families must be assured of the pay healthcare housing education and overall support they have earned 
in recent years they have been carrying the burden of budgetary restraint more than any other americans through cuts in their pay health benefits and retirement plans 
about percent of enlistees come from military families 
we can not expect that level of patriotic commitment to continue among young people who have experienced the way their families have been treated 
we must ensure that the nation keeps its commitments to those who signed on the dotted line of enlistment 
the repeated troop deployments during conflicts in the middle east have been unusually hard on all members of their households worsening unemployment and underemployment among spouses 
in many cases they and their children have been at war for years 
we must strengthen existing programs that offer families readjustment information and counseling and we urge states to help by providing job programs license reciprocity onestop service centers and education 
the burden of our countrys extended military involvement in the middle east has taken a toll on our service personnel 
suicides among our military active duty troops reservists national guardsmen and veterans are at shocking levels 
while postservice medical conditions including addiction and mental illness require more and more assistance 
more than ever our government must work with the private sector to advance opportunities and provide assistance to those wounded in spirit as well as in body 
whether through experimental efforts like the paws puppies assisting wounded servicemen program for service dogs or through the faithbased institutions that have traditionally been providers of counseling and aid 
we support the rights of conscience of military chaplains of all faiths to practice their faith free from political interference 
we reject attempts by the obama administration to censure and silence them particularly christians and christian chaplains 
we support an increase in the size of the chaplain corps 
a republican commanderin chief will protect the religious freedom of all military members especially chaplains and will not tolerate attempts to ban bibles or religious symbols from military facilities 
a republican commanderin chief will also encourage education regarding the religious liberties of military personnel under both the first amendment of the us constitution and the current national defense authorization act 
our countrys allvolunteer force has been a success 
we oppose the reinstatement of the draft except in dire circumstances like world war whether directly or through compulsory national service 
we support the allvolunteer force and oppose unnecessary policy changes including compulsory national service and selective service registration of women for a possible future draft 
we reiterate our support for both the advancement of women in the military 
and their exemption from direct ground combat units and infantry battalions 
we affirm the cultural values that encourage selfless service and superiority in battle 
and we oppose anything which might divide or weaken team cohesion including intramilitary special interest demonstrations 
in particular we warn against modification or lessening of standards in order to satisfy a nonmilitary agenda imposed by the white house 
we call for an objective review of the impact on readiness of the current administrations ideology based personnel policies and will correct problems with appropriate administrative legal or legislative action 
we reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation 
and will not accept or continue attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness 
we believe that our nation is most secure when the president and the administration prioritize readiness recruitment and retention 
rather than using the military to advance a social or political agenda 
military readiness should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness 
we oppose legislative attempts to modify the system of military justice that would undermine its fairness and due process rights for all concerned both the accuser and the accused 
our reserve and national guard forces are national assets that must be nurtured in a manner commensurate with their role as americas sentinels 
their historic mission as citizensoldiers is a proud tradition linking every town and city across america to libertys cause 
since september the national guard has transformed from a strategic reserve to a fully integrated operational fighting force 
the guard has bled on missions in iraq afghanistan the balkans and the sinai 
today more than fifty percent of our guardsmen have combat experience 
the guard has demonstrated its value to the nation not only in war but during emergencies here at home such as hurricane katrina and super storm sandy 
to avoid the overextension of our military we support a larger active force 
and oppose the current administrations cuts to the national guard and reserves 
those reductions are dangerous and counterproductive because the men and women of the guard and reserve tend to be older and more experienced than their active duty counterparts 
guard and reserve forces are currently deployed at historically high rates 
the army reserve alone has soldiers in countries 
to its credit the republican congress by passing the national defense authorization act has moved to ensure these troops have what they need 
that provision has triggered another veto threat from the commander inchief even though the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the house and senate 
he would have the members of the reserve and guard train on and potentially be deployed with equipment that is no longer used by their active duty comrades 
we can not tolerate this endangerment of both our troops and our national security 
therefore we recommend a permanent line item for national guard affairs one that is not eliminated by the president and reinstated by congress 
the guard is too essential to our national defense to be a secondary decision 
our nations veterans have been our nations strength and remain a national resource 
their service to their country as community leaders volunteers mentors educators problem solvers and public officials continues long after they leave the military 
in the same way our obligation to the one percent who defend the other ninety nine percent does not end when they take off the uniform 
america has a sacred trust with our veterans 
and we are committed to ensuring them and their families care and dignity 
the work of the department of veterans affairs va is essential to meet our commitments to them providing health education disability survivor and home loan benefits and arranging memorial services upon death 
we heed abraham lincolns command to care for him who bore the battle 
to care as well for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice who must be assured of meaningful financial assistance remains our solemn duty 
as shown by recent controversies at the department senior leaders must be held accountable for ensuring that their subordinates are more responsive to veterans needs 
the va has failed those who have sacrificed the most for our freedom 
the va must move from a sometimes adversarial stance to an advocacy relationship with vets 
to that end we will empower the secretary to hold all va employees accountable 
and will seek fundamental change in the vas senior leadership structure by placing presidential appointees rather than careerists in additional positions of significant responsibility 
we can not allow an unresponsive bureaucracy to blunt our national commitment 
the va must strengthen and improve its efforts through partnerships with private enterprises 
veteran service organizations 
technology and innovation 
and competitive bidding to enable the va to better provide both quality and timely care along with all earned benefits to our nations veterans and their families 
this will allow the va to reduce the backlog and save immense resources all at the same time 
therefore let us look to innovative solutions that allow higher quality va care 
reduce backlogs 
and save immense resources all at the same time 
our wounded warriors whether still in service or discharged deserve the best medical care the country can provide 
we must make military and veterans medicine the gold standard for mental health traumatic brain injury multiple traumas loss of limbs and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd 
those injuries require a new commitment of targeted resources and personnel for treatment and care to advance recovery 
that includes allowing veterans to choose to access care in the community and not just in va facilities 
because the best care in the world is not effective if it is not accessible 
we will seek to consolidate the vas existing community care authorities to make a single program that will be easily understood by both veterans and va healthcare providers 
like the rest of american medicine the va faces a critical shortage of primary care and mental health physicians 
thats why there are long waiting times to see a doctor and why doctors are often frustrated by the limited time they have with their patients 
this is especially the case with mental health care which often amounts to prescribing drugs because there are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists to do anything else 
inadequate treatment of ptsd drives other problems like suicide homelessness and unemployment 
this situation may not be quickly reversed but a republican administration will begin on day one to undertake the job 
as a nation we honor the sacrifice of our fallen service members at the graves where we lay them to rest in national state and veterans cemeteries around the world 
in doing so we make it clear that their ultimate sacrifice and service to our country will never be forgotten 
as a party we seek to honor their sacrifice and comfort their families by ensuring all veterans cemeteries are adequately equipped and a standard of care established using arlington cemetery as a guide that is befitting their service 
the level of financial distress and homelessness among vets is a shame to the nation 
for a veteran a job is more than a source of income 
it is a new mission with a new status and the transition can be difficult 
we urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the organizations that have proven programs to accomplish this 
we will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment 
we urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans affairs 
particularly with regard to expediting disability claims since those closest to an individual can often best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy 
we will halt the current administrations unconstitutional automatic denial of gun ownership to returning members of our armed forces who have had representatives appointed to manage their financial affairs 
we urge state education officials to promote the hiring of qualified veterans as teachers in our public schools 
their proven abilities and life experiences will make them more successful instructors and role models for students than would any teaching certification 
overprescription of opioids has become a nationwide problem hindering the treatment of veterans suffering from mental health issues 
we therefore support the need to explore new and broader ranges of options 
including faith based programs 
that will better serve the veteran and reduce the need to rely on drugs as the sole treatment 
for the last several generations our countrys two major political parties were dedicated to the nations security and the advance of freedom around the world 
both had learned from mistakes of the past and realized that a weak america invited aggression 
both recognized the need to stand with friends and oppose those who wished us evil 
whatever their disagreements both the republican and democratic parties stood for peace through strength 
and strength meant american military superiority 
this bipartisan commitment has tragically changed 
the leadership of the democratic party both those in office and those who seek it no longer see america as a force for good in the world 
they do not stand by allies or stand strong against our foes 
they pander to world opinion and neglect the national interest 
they can not be trusted to advance either the cause of liberty or our national security in the dangerous years in which we live 
we affirm our partys tradition of world leadership established by president eisenhower and followed by every republican president since 
it stands for enormous power and the prudence to use it sparingly precisely and only in grave necessity 
it stands for involvement not intervention 
it requires consultation not permission to act 
it leads from the front and ensures all others do their parts as well 
it embraces american exceptionalism 
and rejects the false prophets of decline and diminution 
it is in sum the way we will lead the world into a new century of greater peace and prosperity another american century 
the middle east is more dangerous now than at any time since the second world war 
whatever their disagreements presidents of both parties had always prioritized americas national interests 
the trust of friendly governments 
and the security of israel 
that sound consensus was replaced with impotent grandstanding on the part of the current president and his secretaries of state 
the results have been ruinous for all parties except islamic terrorists and their iranian and other sponsors 
we consider the administrations deal with iran to lift international sanctions and make hundreds of billions of dollars available to the mullahs a personal agreement between the president and his negotiating partners and nonbinding on the next president 
without a twothirds endorsement by the senate it does not have treaty status 
because of it the defiant and emboldened regime in tehran continues to sponsor terrorism across the region develop a nuclear weapon testfire ballistic missiles inscribed with death to israel and abuse the basic human rights of its citizens 
a republican president will not be bound by it 
we must retain all options in dealing with a situation that gravely threatens our security our interests and the survival of our friends 
over the last four years we have seen the rise of a murderous fanaticism in the form of isis the so called islamic state 
its reach now extends far beyond the middle east to virtually every continent 
isis has brought ancient butchery into the st century 
nations are imploding erasing long established borders 
the obama administration and its secretary of state so mishandled the arab spring that it destabilized the entire region 
the hope some saw in the arab spring has transformed into disappointment 
the dictator of syria bashar assad has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people and created millions of refugees 
and an american president has been unable to rally the world against him 
understandably our allies fear for their future in a region far more dangerous than it was eight years ago 
a republican administration will restore our nations credibility 
we must stand up for our friends 
challenge our foes 
and destroy isis 
hezbollah controlling over missiles in lebanon must be isolated and lebanons independence restored 
we will support the transition to a postassad syrian government that is representative of its people 
protects the rights of all minorities and religions 
respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors 
and contributes to peace and stability in the region 
the iraqi people have been on the front lines in the fight against terror 
hundreds of thousands have been killed and the attacks against them continue even in baghdad 
our partnership with them should continue as long as isis and others like it survive in the region 
we are deeply concerned that in the face of genocide against them christian communities in cities like erbil are receiving no financial support from either the us government or the un to help with displaced persons and urban refugees 
their survival is sustained only by private charities 
this must change immediately 
defeating isis means more than pushing back its fighters while abandoning its victims 
it must mean aiding those who have suffered the most and doing so before they starve 
it means supporting the longterm survival of indigenous religious and ethnic communities 
punishing the perpetrators of crimes against humanity 
and conditioning humanitarian and military assistance to governments on their observable commitment to human rights 
we continue to support the kurdish people whose bravery and cooperation with our forces merit our respect and their autonomy 
many countries in the region have given and continue to give substantial assistance to the united states because they understand that our struggle against terrorism is not an ethnic or religious fight 
they consider violent extremists to be abusers of their faith not its champions 
we applaud their courage and value their counsel 
the us government together with its global partners should mobilize its political economic and military assets to support the creation of a safe haven in northern iraq to protect those ethnic and religious minorities continuing to face genocide at the hands of isis 
like the united states of america the modern state of israel is a country born from the aspiration for freedom and stands out among the nations as a beacon of democracy and humanity 
beyond our mutual strategic interests israel is likewise an exceptional country that shares our most essential values 
it is the only country in the middle east where freedom of speech and freedom of religion are found 
therefore support for israel is an expression of americanism 
and it is the responsibility of our government to advance policies that reflect americans strong desire for a relationship with no daylight between america and israel 
we recognize jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the jewish state and call for the american embassy to be moved there in fulfillment of us law 
we reaffirm americas commitment to israels security 
and will ensure that israel maintains a qualitative military edge over any and all adversaries 
we support israels right and obligation to defend itself against terror attacks upon its people 
and against alternative forms of warfare being waged upon it legally economically culturally and otherwise 
we reject the false notion that israel is an occupier and specifically recognize that the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds is antisemitic in nature and seeks to destroy israel 
therefore we call for effective legislation to thwart actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with israel or persons or entities doing business in israel or in israelicontrolled territories in a discriminatory manner 
the united states seeks to assist in the establishment of comprehensive and lasting peace in the middle east 
to be negotiated among those living in the region 
we oppose any measures intended to impose an agreement or to dictate borders or other terms and we call for the immediate termination of all us funding of any entity that attempts to do so 
our party is proud to stand with israel now and always 
we are a pacific nation with economic military and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim 
and treaty alliances with japan south korea australia the philippines and thailand 
with them we look toward the establishment of human rights for the people of north korea 
we urge the government of china to recognize the inevitability of change in the kim familys slave state 
and for everyones safety against nuclear disaster to hasten positive change on the korean peninsula 
the united states will continue to demand the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons program with full accounting of its proliferation activities 
we also pledge to counter any threats from the north korean regime 
we salute the people of taiwan with whom we share the values of democracy human rights a free market economy and the rule of law 
our relations will continue to be based upon the provisions of the taiwan relations act and we affirm the six assurances given to taiwan in by president reagan 
we oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the taiwan straits on the principle that all issues regarding the islands future must be resolved peacefully through dialogue 
and be agreeable to the people of taiwan 
if china were to violate those principles the united states in accord with the taiwan relations act will help taiwan defend itself 
we praise efforts by the new government in taipei to continue constructive relations across the taiwan strait and call on china to reciprocate 
as a loyal friend of america taiwan has merited our strong support 
including free trade agreement status 
the timely sale of defensive arms including technology to build diesel submarines 
and full participation in the world health organization international civil aviation organization and other multilateral institutions 
chinas behavior has negated the optimistic language of our last platform concerning our future relations with china 
the liberalizing policies of recent decades have been abruptly reversed 
dissent brutally crushed 
religious persecution heightened 
the internet crippled 
a barbaric population control twochild policy of forced abortions and forced sterilizations continued 
and the cult of mao revived 
critics of the regime have been kidnapped by its agents in foreign countries 
to distract the populace from its increasing economic problems and more importantly to expand its military might the government asserts a preposterous claim to the entire south china sea and continues to dredge ports and create landing fields in contested waters where none have existed before ever nearer to us territories and our allies 
while building a navy far out of proportion to defensive purposes 
the complacency of the obama regime has emboldened the chinese government and military to issue threats of intimidation throughout the south china sea 
not to mention parading their new missile the guam killer down the main streets of beijing 
a direct shot at guam as americas first line of defense 
meanwhile cultural genocide continues in tibet and xinjiang 
the promised autonomy of hong kong is eroded 
the currency is manipulated 
our technology is stolen 
and intellectual property and copyrights are mocked in an economy based on piracy 
in business terms this is not competition it is a hostile takeover 
for any american company to abet those offenses 
especially governmental censorship and tracking of dissenters is a disgrace 
the return to maoism by chinas current rulers is not reason to disengage with the chinese people or their institutions 
we welcome students tourists and investors who can see for themselves our vibrant american democracy and how real democracy works 
we caution however against academic or cultural operations under the control of the chinese government 
and call upon american colleges to dissociate themselves from this increasing threat to academic freedom and honest research 
most of the nations of southeast asia have set aside crippling ideologies and sought material progress in free enterprise and democracy 
we congratulate the people of burma on their emergence from authoritarian rule 
and urge their respect for the rights of their countrys minority populations 
our improved relations with vietnam including arms sales must advance efforts to obtain an accounting for and repatriation of the remains of americans who gave their lives in the cause of vietnamese freedom 
we can not overlook the continued repression of fundamental rights and religious freedom 
as well as retribution against ethnic minorities and others who assisted us forces during the conflict there 
india is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner 
the dynamism of its people 
and the endurance of their democratic institutions 
are earning their country a position of leadership not only in asia but throughout the world 
we encourage the indian government to permit expanded foreign investment and trade 
the key to rising living standards for those left out of their countrys energetic economy 
for all of indias religious communities we urge protection against violence and discrimination 
republicans note with pride the contributions to our country that are made by our fellow citizens of indian ancestry 
conflicts in the middle east have created special political and military challenges for the people of pakistan 
our working relationship is a necessary though sometimes difficult benefit to both and we look toward the strengthening of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict 
this process can not progress as long as any citizen of pakistan can be punished for helping the war on terror 
pakistanis afghans and americans have a common interest in ridding the region of the taliban and securing pakistans nuclear arsenal 
that goal has been undermined by the current administrations feckless treatment of troop commitments 
and blatant disregard of advice from commanders on the ground particularly with regard to afghanistan 
a republican president will work with all regional leaders to restore mutual trust 
while insisting upon progress against corruption and the narcotic trade that fuels insurgency 
with bipartisan support president truman forged the north atlantic treaty organization nato as an alliance of the western democracies 
its continued effectiveness is vital especially in light of recent military challenges in eastern europe 
with the american people spending on defense per capita four times the amount spent by europeans we demand as we have in the past that our fellow members of nato fulfill their commitments and meet their need for greater investment in their armed forces 
our historic ties to the peoples of europe have been based on shared culture and values 
common interests and goals 
their endurance can not be taken for granted especially in light of the continents economic problems and demographic changes 
we recognize with regret the increasing trend among many of our allies to move away from rights and liberties that americans hold dear especially freedom of speech 
it would be a tragic irony if the nations of europe which withstood soviet repression were to now impose a form of it upon themselves 
we honor our special relationship with the people of the united kingdom 
and are grateful for their staunch support in the fight against terrorism 
we respect their decision concerning their nations relationship to the european union and pledge that however much other international relationships may change those who were first to our side in our hour of loss will always rank first in our policies and our esteem 
we thank the several nations of europe that have contributed to a united effort in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere 
their support and sacrifice in the fight against islamic terrorism will not be forgotten 
we applaud the ongoing reconciliation in northern ireland 
and hope that its success might be replicated in cyprus 
we urge greater coordination in economic and security affairs between the united states and the republics of eastern europe 
we urge that poland be granted visa waiver status and we support placement of nato troops in poland 
for the people of russia we affirm our respect and our determination to maintain a friendship beyond the reach of those who wish to divide us 
we have common imperatives ending terrorism 
combating nuclear proliferation 
promoting trade and more 
we also have a common problem the continuing erosion of personal liberty and fundamental rights under the current officials in the kremlin 
repressive at home and reckless abroad 
their policies imperil the nations which regained their selfdetermination upon the collapse of the soviet union 
we will meet the return of russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the soviet union 
we will not accept any territorial change in eastern europe imposed by force in ukraine georgia or elsewhere 
and will use all appropriate constitutional measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination 
we urge greater attention in us diplomacy trade and strategic planning to the nations of eurasia formerly parts of the soviet empire 
caught between their two authoritarian neighbors their path toward democratic institutions has been uncertain 
we urge our government and our allies to work toward the integration of the central asian republics into the global economy 
through foreign investment 
which can bring with it market and political reforms 
and a firmer establishment of the rule of law 
those developments will not only improve the living conditions throughout that vast area 
but are likely to reduce the lure of the radical ideologies that already threaten the region 
our future is intimately tied to the future of the americas 
family language culture environment and trade link us closely with both canada 
and mexico 
our relations with both of these friends will be based upon continuing cooperation and our mutually shared interests 
our attention to trade and environmental issues will contribute to strong economic growth and prosperity throughout the americas 
we thank our neighbors in mexico and canada who have been our partners in the fight against terrorism and the war on drugs 
the mexican people deserve our assistance as they bravely resist the drug cartels that traffic in death on both sides of our border 
their rich cultural and religious heritage shared by many millions of our fellow citizens 
should foster greater understanding and cooperation between our countries 
our canadian neighbors can count on our cooperation and respect 
to advance north americas energy independence we intend to reverse the current administrations blocking of the keystone xl pipeline 
apart from its economic value that project has become a symbol in the contest between the publics desire for economic development 
and the governments hostility to growth 
we stand with the people 
we express our solidarity with all the peoples of the western hemisphere 
their aspirations for economic betterment and political liberty have deserved better from our government than its policies of the last eight years 
the current administration has abandoned americas friends and rewarded its enemies 
a republican president will never embrace a marxist dictator in venezuela or anywhere else 
the current chief executive has allowed that country to become a narcoterrorist state an iranian outpost threatening central america and a safe haven for the agents of hezbollah 
now with their country ruined by socialism and on the verge of chaos the venezuelan people are fighting to restore their democracy and regain their rights 
when they triumph as they surely will the united states will stand ready to help them restore their country to the family of the americas 
we affirm our friendship and admiration for the people of colombia 
and call on the republican congress to express its solidarity with their decadeslong fight against the terrorist farc 
their sacrifice and suffering must not be betrayed by the accession to power of murderers and drug lords 
we want to welcome the people of cuba back into our hemispheric family 
after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to account for their crimes against humanity 
we stand with the women in white and all the victims of the loathsome regime that clings to power in havana 
we do not say this lightly they have been betrayed by those who are currently in control of us foreign policy 
the current administrations opening to cuba was a shameful accommodation to the demands of its tyrants 
it will only strengthen their military dictatorship 
we call on the congress to uphold current us law which sets conditions for the lifting of sanctions on the island legalization of political parties 
an independent media 
and free and fair internationallysupervised elections 
we call for a dedicated platform for the transmission of radio and tv marti and for the promotion of internet access and circumvention technology as tools to strength cubas prodemocracy movement 
we support the work of the commission for assistance to a free cuba 
and affirm the principles of the cuban adjustment act of recognizing the rights of cubans fleeing communism 
we recognize africas extraordinary potential 
both the united states and our many african allies will become stronger through investment trade 
and promotion of the democratic and free market principles that have brought prosperity around the world 
we pledge to be the best partner of all african nations in their pursuit of economic freedom 
and human rights 
the republican congress has extended to the african growth and opportunity act 
and president george w bushs health initiatives aids relief under pepfar and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria continue to save millions of lives 
peace corps volunteers and us seabees teach and build in villages that know firsthand our countrys idealism 
we stand in solidarity with those african countries now under assault by the forces of radical islam boko haram alshabaab and others like them 
their terror falls on both muslims and christians on anyone who will not submit to their savage ideology 
we urge governments throughout the continent to recognize this threat to their own people 
we support closer cooperation in both military and economic matters with those on the front lines of civilizations battle against the forces of evil 
there is no substitute for principled american leadership 
since the end of world war ii the united states through the founding of the united nations and nato has participated in a number of international organizations which can 
but sometimes do not 
serve the cause of peace and prosperity 
while acting through them our country must always reserve the right to go its own way 
we must not be silent about our countrys cause 
that is why we have long supported our countrys international broadcasting to eastern europe the middle east and asia 
our continued participation in the united nations should be contingent upon the enactment of longoverdue changes in the way that institution functions 
american taxpayers the chief funders of the un deserve full transparency in the financial operations of its overpaid bureaucrats 
we should no longer tolerate its managerial scandals 
its human rights council composed of some of the worlds worst tyrants 
and its treatment of israel as a pariah state 
the uns population fund has from its origin been rooted in nogrowth policies that limit economic development in the countries needing it most 
its complicity in chinas barbaric program of forced abortion led president reagan to set a wall of separation his mexico city policy which prohibits the granting of federal monies to nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortion 
we affirm his position and in light of plummeting birth rates around the world 
suggest a reevaluation of the uns record on economic progress 
precisely because we take our countrys treaty obligations seriously we oppose ratification of international agreements whose longrange implications are ominous or unclear 
we do not support the un convention on womens rights the convention on the rights of the child the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and the un arms trade treaty as well as various declarations from the un conference on environment and development 
because of our concern for american sovereignty 
domestic management of our fisheries 
and our countrys longterm energy needs 
we have deep reservations about the regulatory legal and tax regimes inherent in the law of the sea treaty 
we emphatically reject un agenda as erosive of us sovereignty and we oppose any form of global tax 
to shield members of our armed forces and others in service to america from ideological prosecutions overseas the republican party does not accept the jurisdiction of the international criminal court 
we support statutory protection for us personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet our global security requirements 
and we deplore the current inaction of the administration in that regard 
our service members must be subject only to american law 
the us commission on international religious freedom an initiative of congressional republicans has been neglected by the current administration at a time when its voice more than ever needs to be heard 
religious minorities across the middle east have been driven from their ancient homelands 
and thousands there and in africa have been slaughtered for their faith in what the state department has belatedly labeled genocide 
the united states must stand with leaders like president sisi of egypt who has bravely protected the rights of coptic christians in egypt 
and call on other leaders across the region to ensure that all religious minorities whether yazidi bahai orthodox catholic or protestant christians are free to practice their religion without fear of persecution 
at a time when china has renewed its destruction of churches 
christian homeschooling parents are jailed in parts of europe 
and even canada threatens pastors for their preaching 
a republican administration will return the advocacy of religious liberty to a central place in its diplomacy 
will quickly designate the systematic killing of religious and ethnic minorities a genocide 
and will work with the leaders of other nations to condemn and combat genocidal acts 
foreign aid must serve americas interests first 
in todays world of complex challenges international assistance is a critical tool for advancing americas security and economic interests by preventing conflict 
building stability 
opening markets for private investment 
and responding to suffering and need with the compassion that is at the heart of our countrys values 
a strong commitment to international development and diplomacy 
alongside defense was a key component of president reagans peace through strength strategy 
it can sometimes serve as an alternative means of keeping the peace far less costly both in dollars and in human lives than military engagement 
the millennium challenge corporation spearheaded by the last republican administration has established a new model of foreign assistance that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on projects that are effective resultsdriven transparent and accountable 
we must embrace this model throughout our foreign assistance programs and efforts as a catalyst for private sector investment to combat corruption 
strengthen the rule of law 
and open new markets for american goods and services in a competitive global economy 
foreign assistance programs must not only project the best of american values 
but must work to create selfsustainability and leverage the resources and capacity of the private sector 
even more important is the overseas assistance billions of dollars and volunteer hours provided by americas foundations 
educational institutions 
faithbased groups 
and charitable individuals 
their essential role in international development should be weighed in any revision of the tax code 
the advance of political freedom and entrepreneurial capitalism drives economic growth 
catalyzes private sector development 
and is the only sustainable solution to poverty 
over the last years the level of private investment overseas from the united states has eclipsed aid many times over 
our development strategy must build on recent republican efforts to use foreign assistance to catalyze private sector investment and expertise in addressing global challenges that can build a more stable world 
and advance americas national security 
and economic interests 
the integrity of our countrys foreign assistance program has been compromised by the current administrations attempt to impose on foreign recipients especially the peoples of africa its own radical social agenda 
while excluding faithbased groups the sector with the best track record in promoting development because they will not conform to that agenda 
we pledge to reverse this course encouraging more involvement by the most effective aid organizations 
and trusting developing peoples to build their futures through their own values 
to those who stand in the darkness of tyranny america has always been a beacon of hope and so it must remain 
radical islamic terrorism poses an existential threat to personal freedom and peace around the world 
we oppose its brutal assault on all human beings all of whom have inherent dignity 
the republican party stands united with all victims of terrorism 
and will fight at home and abroad to destroy terrorist organizations 
and protect the lives and fundamental liberties of all people 
republicans have led the way in promoting initiatives that have protected and rescued millions of the worlds most vulnerable and persecuted 
standing up for repressed religious groups 
prisoners of conscience 
women trafficked into sexual slavery 
and those suffering from disease or starvation is not just consistent with american values 
it advances important security and economic interests as well 
a republican administration will never say as hillary clinton did as secretary of state in that raising human rights concerns cant interfere with the global economic crisis the global climate change crisis and the security crisis 
the united states needs a radical rethinking of our human rights diplomacy 
a republican administration will adopt a whole of government approach to protect fundamental freedoms globally 
one where pressing human rights and rule of law issues are integrated at every appropriate level of our bilateral relationships and strategic decisionmaking 
republican policy will reflect the fact that the health of the us economy 
and environment 
the safety of our food and drug supplies 
the security of our investments and personal information in cyberspace 
and the stability and security of the oceans 
will increasingly depend on allowing the free flow of news and information 
and developing an independent judiciary and civil society in countries with repressive governments such as china russia and many nations in the middle east and africa 
as an estimated million people worldwide are trapped in modern day slavery we are reminded to be vigilant against human trafficking in whatever form it appears 
we will use the full force of the law against those who engage in commercial sexual exploitation and forced or bonded labor of men women or children involuntary domestic servitude 
trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal 
and the illegal recruitment and use of child soldiers 
building on the accomplishments of the last republican administration in implementing the trafficking victims protection act of we call for increased diplomatic efforts and accountability for foreign governments to prosecute traffickers 
including penalties for any public officials who may be complicit in this devastating crime 
we will highlight the need to stop slave labor taking steps to prevent overseas labor contractors who exploit foreign workers from supporting military bases abroad or exporting goods to the united states 
a republican administration will strategize with partners around the world to prevent the demand for trafficking victims that makes exploitation lucrative 
and will prosecute sex tourists and domestic buyers to the fullest extent of the law 
we will work at home and abroad to ensure that trafficking victims are identified among migrants refugees and our own citizens 
so they receive the rehabilitative care needed to heal and thrive 
americas continuing participation in the international campaign against human trafficking merits our support 
the goal of our domestic antitrafficking programs should be the rescue and safe return of victims to their homes 
not creating a longterm dependency upon public support 
we call for greater scrutiny of overseas labor contractors to prevent abuses against temporary foreign workers brought to the united states 
the horrific deaths of smuggled workers on our southwestern border at the hands of drug cartels and other gangs highlight the need for total security in that region 
cyber attacks against our businesses institutions and the government itself have become almost routine 
they will continue until the world understands that an attack will not be tolerated that we are prepared to respond in kind and in greater magnitude 
despite their promises to the contrary russia and china see cyber operations as a part of a warfare strategy during peacetime 
our response should be to cause diplomatic financial and legal pain 
curtailing visas for guilty parties freezing their assets and pursuing criminal actions against them 
we should seek to weaken control over the internet by regimes that engage in cyber crimes 
we must stop playing defense and go on offense to avoid the cyberequivalent of pearl harbor 
the republican congress has passed important legislation to advance informationsharing among entities endangered by cyber attacks 
we will explore the possibility of a free market for cyberinsurance and make clear that users have a selfdefense right to deal with hackers as they see fit 
it is critical that we protect the cyber supply chain to ensure against contamination of components made all over the world sometimes in offending countries 
our own cyber workforce should be expanded with the assistance of the military business and hacker communities to better protect our country 
a single nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude over this country would collapse our electrical grid and other critical infrastructures and endanger the lives of millions 
with north korea in possession of nuclear missiles and iran close to having them an emp is no longer a theoretical concern it is a real threat 
moreover china and russia include sabotage as part of their warfare planning 
nonetheless hundreds of electrical utilities in the united states have not acted to protect themselves from emp 
and they can not be expected to do so voluntarily since homeland security is a government responsibility 
the president the congress the department of homeland security the department of defense the states the utilities and the private sector should work together on an urgent basis to enact republican legislation pending in both chambers to protect the national grid 
and encourage states to take the initiative to protect their own grids expeditiously 
internet firewall circumvention and anticensorship technology must become a national priority in light of the way authoritarian governments such as china cuba and iran restrict free press and isolate their people limiting political cultural and religious freedom 
leaders of authoritarian governments argue that governments have the same legal right to control internet access as they do to control migrant access 
a focus on internet freedom is a costeffective means of peacefully advancing fundamental freedoms in closed and authoritarian societies 
but it is also an important economic interest as censorship constitutes a trade barrier for us companies operating in societies like china with advanced firewall protection policies 
a republican administration will champion an open and free internet based on principles of free expression and universal values 
and will pursue policies to empower citizens and us companies operating in authoritarian countries to circumvent internet firewalls and gain accurate news and information online
