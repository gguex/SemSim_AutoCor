terrorists like al qaeda affiliates unlike adversary nation ever known 
face global terrorist movement many groups funded different sources separate agendas committed assaulting united states free open societies around globe 
despite tough talk president bush actions terrorism fallen far short 
still comprehensive strategy victory 
allowing bin laden escape grasp tora bora diverted crucial resources effort destroy al qaeda afghanistan 
doctrine unilateral preemption driven away allies cost us support nations 
must put place strategy win approach recognizes addresses many facets mortal challenge terrorists root causes give rise new recruits uses tools disposal 
agents terrorism work shadows nations every continent 
possible path victory found company others walking alone 
john kerry commander chief never wait green light abroad safety stake 
must enlist whose support need ultimate victory 
victory war terror requires combination american determination international cooperation fronts 
requires ability willingness direct immediate effective military action capture destruction terrorist groups leaders possible 
massive improvement intelligence gathering analysis coupled vigorous law enforcement

global effort prevent failed failing states become sanctuaries terrorists 
sustained effort deny terrorists recruits conducting effective public diplomacy 
sustained political economic effort improve education 
work peace 
support democracy extend hope 
train equip military enhance capabilities seek destroy terrorists 
strengthen capacity intelligence law enforcement around world forging stronger international coalitions provide better information communication 
must also improve intelligence home 
failure uncover september th plot deeply misguided reports iraq supposed weapons mass destruction experienced unprecedented intelligence failures recent years 
must president bush refused reform intelligence system creating true director national intelligence real control intelligence personnel budgets

launch name shame campaign financing terror 
nations respond shut u financial system 
specific case saudi arabia put end bush administration kid glove approach supply laundering terrorist money 
nowhere need collective endeavor greater afghanistan 
bush administration badly mishandled war aftermath 
two years ago president bush promised marshall plan rebuild country 
instead turned away afghanistan allowing become potential terrorists 
must expand nato forces outside kabul 
must accelerate training afghan army police 
program disarm reintegrate warlord militias society must expedited expanded mainstream strategy 
attack exploding opium trade ignored bush administration doubling counter narcotics assistance karzai government reinvigorating regional drug control program 
beyond afghanistan terrorist attacks saudi arabia indonesia kenya morocco turkey point widening network terrorists targeting country friends 
failed failing states like somalia countries large areas limited government control like philippines indonesia need international help close terrorist havens 
core conflict fundamental struggle ideas democracy tolerance would use means attack target impose narrow views 
war terror clash civilizations 
clash civilization chaos 
america needs major initiative public diplomacy support many voices freedom arab muslim world

democracy blossom overnight america speed growth sustaining forces democracy repressive regimes rewarding governments work toward end 
greater threat american security possibility terrorists armed weapons mass destruction 
preventing terrorists gaining access weapons must number one security goal 
containing massive threat requires american leadership highest order 
leadership brings allies friends partners greater collaboration participation 
compels problem states join comply international agreements abandon weapons programs 
unfortunately administration policies moved america opposite direction 
weakened international agreements efforts enforce non proliferation instead strengthening 
done nearly enough secure existing stockpiles bomb making materials 
failed take effective steps stop north korean iranian nuclear programs 
must change course 
first world notice take every possible measure defend possibility attack unconventional arms 
attack appears imminent everything necessary stop 
strike occur respond overwhelming devastating force 
never wait act choice war 
must build lead international consensus early preventive action lock secure existing weapons mass destruction material manufacture 
first step safeguard bomb making material worldwide 
need find catalog lock away 
approach simple treat nuclear materials make bombs like bombs 
decade fall berlin wall russia still nearly nuclear weapons enough nuclear material produce 
weapons materials cooperative security upgrades completed 
world relying whatever measures russia taken 
current pace take years secure potential bomb material former soviet union 
wait long 
four years 
lead international coalition put end production new materials highly enriched uranium plutonium use nuclear weapons 
reduce excess stocks existing nuclear materials weapons 
conduct global cleanout initiative remove stockpiles vulnerable highly enriched uranium research reactors facilities dozens countries around world within four years 
must show determined leadership end nuclear weapons program north korea prevent development nuclear weapons places like iran 
north korea sold ballistic missiles technology past 
north koreans made clear world terrorists open business sell highest bidder 
administration fixated iraq nuclear dangers north korea multiplied 
north koreans allegedly made enough new fuel make six nine nuclear bombs 
maintain six party talks must also prepared talk directly north korea negotiate comprehensive agreement addresses full range issues allies 
illusions kim jong il 
agreement must rigorous verification lead complete irreversible elimination north korea nuclear weapons program 
even scoured iraq signs weapons mass destruction iran reportedly working develop next door 
nuclear armed iran unacceptable risk us allies 
true countries may seeking nuclear weapons 
strengthening nuclear nonproliferation treaty critical 
must close loophole lets countries develop nuclear weapons capabilities guise peaceful civilian nuclear power program
