the covid pandemic has laid bare deep seated problems in our society the fragility of our economy 
and social safety net 
the risks posed by growing inequality 
the impacts of racial and economic disparities on health and well being 
the sidelining of experts 
the rejection of science 
the underinvestment in research 
and the gross corruption and abuses of power 
throw open the doors of opportunity for all americans 
we must once again stop another republican recession from becoming a second great depression 
president trump and the republican party have rigged the economy in favor of the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations and left working families and small businesses out in the cold 
democrats will forge a new social and economic contract with the american people a contract that creates millions of new jobs 
and promotes shared prosperity 
closes racial gaps in income and wealth 
guarantees the right to join or form a union 
raises wages 
and ensures equal pay for women 
and paid family leave for all 
and safeguards a secure and dignified retirement 
we must guarantee health care not as a privilege for some but as a right for every single american 
for a century democrats have fought to secure universal health care 
in the depths of the covid pandemic president trump and the republican party are trying to tear health care away from millions of people who depend on it for survival 
we will not rest until every american can access quality health care and affordable prescription drugs 
we will curb the corrupting influence of money in politics 
we will never tire in our fight to deliver results and create opportunity for all americans 
democrats will root out structural and systemic racism in our economy and our society 
and reform our criminal justice system from top to bottom because we believe black lives matter 
we will give hate no safe harbor 
we will never amplify or legitimize the voices of racism misogyny anti semitism anti muslim bigotry or white supremacy 
democrats will protect and promote the equal rights of all our citizens women lgbtq people religious minorities people with disabilities native americans and all who have been discriminated against in too many ways and for too many generations 
we commit ourselves to the vision articulated by frederick douglass of a government founded upon justice and recognizing the equal rights of all 
we must lead the world in taking on the climate crisis not deny the science and accelerate the damage 
from houston texas to mexico beach florida from san juan puerto rico to davenport iowa the last four years have seen record breaking storms devastating wildfires and historic floods 
democrats will rejoin the paris climate agreement 
that puts workers and communities first 
and leaves no one behind 
we must provide a world class education in every zip code to every child because education is a critical public good 
democrats believe in universal early childhood education 
and affordable high quality child care 
we will shut down the school to prison pipeline and build a school to opportunity pipeline in its place 
we will make college affordable again 
and give americans relief from crushing student debt 
we will focus on what matters most to americans more and better jobs 
a cleaner environment 
and a more inclusive and resilient society 
democrats will lead with diplomacy as our tool of first resort 
and mobilize our allies and partners to meet the tests none of us can meet on our own 
and we will honor our sacred covenant with our women and men in uniform our veterans and our military families 
who have carried the burdens of wars that must at long last come to an end 
disparities in health care access in access to paid sick leave in environmental quality in the employment market and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection and death among black americans native americans latinos and certain asian american and pacific islander communities 
instead of bringing americans together president trump tried to divide us using racist and xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against asian americans and pacific islanders 
and in the midst of the pandemic the trump administration is arguing in court to invalidate the affordable care act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of people 
president trump and his administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us 
preferring to act as though the recession caused by his incompetent mishandling of the covid pandemic will correct itself 
he has hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations 
failed to enact adequate support for public school systems colleges universities 
and state and local governments to maintain public services and jobs 
endangered the health of essential workers by failing to enact workplace safety standards 
and neglected to protect working families from economic ruin 
and lead a global effort to prevent detect and respond to future pandemic threats 
we must start by making covid testing widely available convenient and free to everyone 
we must also expand funding so state and local public health departments can hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for everyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus 
only through widespread regular testing and tracing can we hope to understand the scope of the pandemic and contain it 
in a public health crisis we all have to rely on each other 
that s why democrats support making covid testing treatment and any eventual vaccines free to everyone regardless of their wealth insurance coverage or immigration status 
we are all only as safe from this disease as are the most vulnerable among us 
it has always been a crisis that tens of millions of americans have no or inadequate health insurance but in a pandemic it s catastrophic for public health 
the current crisis would be even worse without the affordable care act in place 
but in the covid pandemic americans need even more help which is why democrats will take immediate action to preserve and expand health insurance coverage 
we will provide direct increased support to states to enroll eligible adults in medicaid 
have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the bill 
and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded medicaid to do so 
for people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and in president trump s recession democrats believe the federal government should pick up percent of the tab for cobra insurance which keeps people on their employer sponsored plans without restrictions 
we will re open the affordable care act marketplaces even outside of the normal open enrollment season and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health coverage 
democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms which includes a platinum level choice with low fees and no deductibles 
low income americans will be automatically enrolled in the public option at zero cost to them though they may choose to opt out at any time 
we will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment falls significantly 
and should the united states find itself in another pandemic or severe economic downturn in the future these protections will be made automatically available so americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis 
democrats are appalled that president trump failed to act on the advice of congress to maintain a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies including personal protective equipment 
or adequately surge u s manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the defense production act 
the resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives including those of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers 
such shortages are unacceptable and must never happen again 
democrats will direct the federal government to work with private sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the united states domestic manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines 
we will restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need not political favoritism 
and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other for life saving materials 
democrats will aggressively enforce non discrimination protections in the americans with disabilities act and other civil rights laws 
especially when designing emergency management systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic 
democrats will prohibit unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities 
and additionally prohibit rationing of health care that refuses or diverts hospitalization treatment or supplies based on a patient s disability 
we recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at greater risk of contracting covid 
and that people with disabilities may require additional resources to protect their health well being and independence during the pandemic 
we will improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes which have seen some of the worst covid outbreaks 
and we will expand support for telemedicine so americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic 
america must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic 
and will take steps to protect federal scientists from political influence 
democrats will act swiftly to stand up a comprehensive national public health surveillance program for covid and future infectious diseases 
we will recruit at least contact tracers with support from trusted local organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus 
democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in america s public health infrastructure 
we will substantially increase funding for the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 
and for state and local public health departments many of which suffered deep budget cuts during the great recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of president trump s recession 
state and local public health departments should be given sufficient resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts 
that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted 
democrats will support medical and public health research grants for historically black colleges and universities hbcus and other minority serving institutions msis which are particularly well suited to research health disparities in the context of covid 
solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back on track 
during acute economic downturns democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce and aim to keep workers whole 
we will reform the current unemployment insurance system to enable more workers to remain attached to their jobs 
including by promoting payroll support and work sharing programs with generous rates of wage replacement and requirements that employers maintain workers benefits 
for those workers who do lose their jobs we will expand the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers including independent contractors and gig part time and tipped workers 
make sure platform companies and companies that misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do 
and raise wage replacement rates which are far too low in many states 
we will expand not cut nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of americans are relying on in this crisis 
democrats will also make long overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states unemployment system technology 
and ensure the department of labor conducts strong oversight of state unemployment systems to make sure that unemployed workers can quickly and efficiently access the benefits they are owed 
to prevent president trump s recession from becoming a depression democrats believe we must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs 
we urgently need to support state and local governments which are suffering severe budget shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of covid related services and rising unemployment 
state and local budget cuts translate quickly into lost jobs in education health care and social services all fields where we need to be adding jobs to meet the needs of the american people 
democrats will extend significant aid to state and local governments 
school districts 
and public and nonprofit colleges and universities including hbcus and msis 
to address these budget shortfalls 
and secure jobs 
we will condition state and federal aid on maintaining and expanding public sector employment including provisions to protect workers rights 
in states and cities across the country too many parents are being forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe 
democrats believe that making child care affordable and widely available is essential to recovering from the covid pandemic 
we will provide funding to stabilize the sector and ensure child care and educational settings are able to meet the highest possible public health and worker safety standards to protect the health of care workers children parents and the broader community 
the united states is facing an unprecedented housing crisis as a result of the covid pandemic and president trump s recession with millions of families at risk of being evicted 
we support state and local measures to freeze rent increases evictions utility shutoffs and late fees for rent to prevent families from becoming homeless and making the pandemic even worse 
the covid pandemic has hit small businesses especially hard 
democrats support making significant immediate grants and loans to help small businesses make payroll pay rent and other expenses and keep their doors open when possible 
some estimates indicate as many as percent of black owned small businesses may not survive president trump s recession and small businesses owned by asian americans and pacific islanders and latinos are also at risk 
democrats will prioritize support for black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color 
as well as women entrepreneurs 
including by expanding funding for community development financial institutions cdfis and other proven programs that invest in low income communities and communities of color 
we will impose rigorous oversight on big corporations seeking financial assistance to weather the pandemic and president trump s recession 
to ensure that federal dollars support keeping workers on payroll not enriching ceos or shareholders 
taxpayer money should not be used to pay out dividends fund stock buybacks or give raises to executives 
no one should have to choose between protecting their health and earning a living 
paid sick leave is a necessity even under normal circumstances but in a pandemic it s a matter of national security 
this is especially true for the black latino asian american and pacific islander native american and low income workers who are less likely to be able to work from home 
we will immediately enact robust paid sick leave protections as part of the covid response for all workers in the economy including contractors gig workers domestic workers and the self employed 
and democrats will take immediate action to protect essential workers on the job where the trump administration has neglected them from agriculture to meatpacking plants to manufacturing facilities to hospitals 
including by issuing and enforcing effective infectious disease workplace safety standards through the occupational safety and health administration 
as millions of americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic it is plain to see that in the st century an accessible internet is not optional it is a vital tool for receiving an education and for participating in the economy and all americans need access to high speed affordable broadband service 
democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking municipalities and rural co ops from building publicly owned broadband networks 
and increase federal support for municipal broadband 
while requiring that funding recipients adhere to policies that support good jobs and include strong protections for workers right to organize 
we will increase public investment in rural urban and tribal broadband infrastructure 
offer low income americans subsidies for accessing high speed internet 
and invest in digital literacy training programs 
so children and families and people with disabilities can fully participate in school work and life from their homes 
and democrats will restore the federal communications commission s fcc clear authority to take strong enforcement action against broadband providers who violate net neutrality principles through blocking throttling paid prioritization or other measures that create artificial scarcity and raise consumer prices for this vital service 
in past public health crises including the ebola epidemic disciplined american diplomacy shaped and led a common global response rallied public and private resources accelerated research into treatments and vaccines and directed global emergency aid 
in the covid pandemic president trump not only failed to lead he actively sabotaged global efforts to slow the pandemic 
he refused to work with our partners to identify and coordinate manufacture of potential vaccines 
allegedly tried to poach exclusive rights to a vaccine candidate from our ally germany 
cut cdc and state department programs for early identification of infectious pathogens 
withdrew funding and support for the world health organization who 
using racist rhetoric to blame outsiders and stoke divisions at home 
driving a coordinated global health and economic response to the covid pandemic 
and ensuring that we re far better prepared for future global health emergencies 
in a matter of weeks the abject failure of president trump and his administration to competently respond to the covid pandemic erased all the job gains made since the obama biden administration pulled the country out of the great recession 
he had the audacity to pay for a permanent tax cut for big business by raising taxes on working families 
he launched a reckless trade war with china that cost more than american jobs 
he has left our communities vulnerable and exposed to the impacts of climate change 
and completely failed to fulfill his campaign promise to the american people to invest in rebuilding and modernizing our nation s crumbling infrastructure 
but our economy was rigged against working families and the middle class even before the novel coronavirus sickened millions and killed more than americans and counting 
working families incomes have been largely stagnant for decades 
meanwhile the rich have been capturing a larger and larger share of the economic pie with incomes for the top one percent growing five times faster than those of the bottom percent 
women still earn just cents to every dollar men earn with even greater disparities for women of color 
median incomes are lower and poverty rates are higher for black americans latinos native americans and certain asian american and pacific islander communities compared to median white households 
and there is a persistent pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of americans back with the typical white household holding six times more wealth than the typical latino family and times more wealth than the typical black family 
president trump s recession threatens to deepen existing inequities as black and latino workers are less likely to work in jobs that can be done safely from home 
less likely to have savings to fall back on 
and less likely to be able to access unemployment insurance and other emergency programs electronically 
a contract that invests in the people and promotes shared prosperity not one that benefits only big corporations and the wealthiest few 
one that affirms housing is a right and not a privilege 
and which makes a commitment that no one will be homeless or go hungry in the richest country on earth 
a new economic contract that raises wages 
and restores workers rights to organize join a union and collectively bargain 
one that at last supports working families and the middle class by securing equal pay for women 
and paid family leave for all 
a new economic contract that provides access for all to reliable and affordable banking and financial services 
and invests instead in building equity and mobility for the people of color who have been left out and left behind for generations 
by investing in infrastructure 
care work 
clean energy 
and small businesses 
to put americans to work in good paying jobs 
shoring up state and local budgets to save jobs 
and protect public health in the ongoing covid pandemic 
and enacting fundamental reforms to address structural and systemic racism and entrenched income and wealth inequality in our economy and our banking system 
americans deserve an economy that works for everyone not just for the wealthy and the well connected 
democrats believe that it is a moral and an economic imperative that we support working families by rebuilding the american middle class for the st century 
making sure this time that everyone can make it and thrive regardless of race gender sexual orientation gender identity disability status national origin age or zip code 
democrats will fight to raise wages for working people 
and improve job quality and security 
including by raising the federal minimum wage so it reaches an hour by 
raising the federal minimum wage so fewer workers are forced to hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet will significantly decrease risks of infection from covid and in the future 
we know that strong american labor unions help increase wages and job standards for workers across the economy 
which is why democrats will prioritize passing the pro act 
and restoring workers rights including the right to launch secondary boycotts 
we will repeal so called right to work laws that undermine worker power and lead to lower wages and less protection for workers across the economy 
and ensure those who have been left without wage and hour protections for decades including domestic workers and farmworkers have the same rights as other workers 
democrats will support legislation to strengthen whistleblower and anti retaliation protections for workers who speak for themselves or their coworkers 
and we will take action to rein in anti competitive corporate power by rewriting the rules that have undermined workers ability to advocate for themselves including non compete clauses no poaching agreements and contracts that force workers into mandatory arbitration to resolve violations of employment laws 
democrats will recognize unions with majority sign up via card check processes 
and ban captive audience meetings which employers use to bully and browbeat workers 
we will hold executives personally accountable if they interfere in workers efforts to organize including issuing criminal penalties for intentional obstruction 
we will take action to guarantee that when workers come to the table they are able to bargain with the employers who actually hold the power including franchisors 
and penalize companies that bargain in bad faith with their workers 
democrats will vigorously protect all private sector workers right to strike without fear of coercion interference and undue delay 
we will also establish the federal government s role in promoting and facilitating collective bargaining and helping the parties bring their negotiations to a rapid and successful conclusion 
committing to a high standard for intervening in strikes including under the railway labor act 
the right of workers to come together and form a union is under attack 
we must unrig the rules that block workers from having the union they want and update our labor laws to make it more possible 
we must change labor law so that it is easier for unions and employers to enter into multi employer agreements establishing minimum workplace standards related to wages benefits and working conditions 
democrats believe taxpayer dollars should never flow to employers who steal workers wages violate labor laws engage in union busting or exploit immigrant workers to depress working conditions for all workers 
we will increase funding and staffing at the department of labor to aggressively enforce wage hour health and safety rules across the economy 
democrats believe employees who are being misclassified including gig and platform workers deserve wage and workplace protections including minimum wage and overtime pay 
and we support using the abc test to determine employee status 
democrats believe that all workers should be able to hold their employers accountable for unpaid or underpaid wages regardless of corporate structure 
we support using grants and collaborative relationships with community organizations to ensure that workers know their rights and responsibilities under the law 
democrats will strengthen labor rights for the more than million public sector employees in the united states by passing the public service freedom to negotiate act which would provide a federal guarantee for public sector employees to bargain for better pay and benefits and the working conditions they deserve 
we can not hope to raise wages without taking on the profound racial biases at work in our employment system 
the wage gap between black workers and white workers is higher today than it was years ago 
it takes a typical black woman months to earn what a typical white man earns in months and for typical latinas and native american women it takes almost two years 
democrats believe we need to be much more proactive and aggressive in rooting out discrimination in our employment system 
we will increase funding to the equal employment opportunity commission 
and increase its authority to initiate directed investigations into civil rights violations violations of the rights of people with disabilities and violations against lgbtq people especially transgender women of color 
federal contractors should be required to develop and disclose plans to recruit and promote people of color women lgbtq people people with disabilities and veterans and be held accountable for delivering 
the united states is alone among advanced economies in guaranteeing neither paid sick leave nor paid family leave for all workers 
this puts excessive burdens on working families and especially working mothers even in the best of times 
and is catastrophic for public health in the midst of the covid pandemic 
democrats will implement paid sick days 
and a high quality comprehensive and inclusive paid family and medical leave system that protects workers from the unfair choice between attending to urgent health or caretaking needs and earning a paycheck 
we will fight to ensure workers are guaranteed at least weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers and family units to enable new parents to recover from childbirth and bond with their newborns foster or adopted children and allow all workers to take extended time off to care for themselves or ailing loved ones 
finding and paying for high quality child care is an emotional logistical and financial tightrope for too many parents and that needs to change 
working parents shouldn t have to choose between keeping their kids safe and earning a paycheck 
democrats will make major investments in quality affordable child care 
including by significantly increasing the child and dependent care tax credit 
and providing access to affordable high quality child care on a sliding scale 
by boosting funding for grants to states to help low income and middle class families afford child care 
we will improve compensation and benefits for child care providers 
and enact universal high quality pre k programs for three and four year olds 
we will also invest in expanding long term services and supports and home and community based care for seniors and people with disabilities 
democrats will increase wages and benefits for paid caregivers in all settings which will improve working conditions and quality of care while enabling family members to rejoin the workforce 
democrats believe the covid pandemic and president trump s recession demand unprecedented transformational federal investments to create family sustaining and union jobs 
that s why we will invest in resilient sustainable and inclusive infrastructure 
we will repair modernize and expand our highways roads bridges and airports 
including by installing public charging stations for electric vehicles 
ensuring our passenger transportation systems are resilient to the impacts of climate change 
and using safe modern design approaches that allow drivers pedestrians cyclists and others to safely share the road 
we will launch our country s second great railroad revolution by investing in high speed rail and passenger and freight rail systems 
and commit to public transportation as a public good 
including ensuring transit jobs are good jobs 
this railroad revolution will reduce pollution 
connect workers to good union jobs 
slash commute times 
and spur investment in rural communities that will now be better linked to major metropolitan areas 
democrats will invest to ensure passenger transportation including public transit is affordable to all 
and accessible to people with disabilities 
we will help transform amtrak from a laggard to a leader in passenger rail accessibility 
and ensure people with disabilities can receive compensation when disability equipment like wheelchairs are lost or damaged by transportation carriers 
democrats will upgrade our nation s ports lock and dam systems and freight infrastructure to accommodate st century cargo 
reduce air and water pollution 
and create and maintain high quality good paying jobs 
we will increase demand for american made ships by ensuring u s cargo is carried on ships flying our flag 
we will make sure that every community in america has access to clean reliable drinking water and safe wastewater systems in their homes including by replacing dangerous lead pipes 
we will increase investment in innovative water technologies including water use efficiency water conservation and water reuse and recycling that reduce water waste and consumer bills 
we will modernize and green our public schools 
and ensure they are accessible to students with disabilities 
and democrats will close the digital divide that deprives more than million americans of high speed internet access by investing in broadband and g technology including rural and municipal broadband 
while ensuring those investments support good jobs 
and include strong protections for workers rights to organize 
and restoring the fcc s authority to take strong enforcement action against internet service providers who violate net neutrality principles 
democrats support the creation of an infrastructure bank a public bank that will leverage public and private resources to build infrastructure projects of national or regional significance 
including in rail and transit 
clean energy and water infrastructure 
broadband 
and affordable housing 
projects that receive assistance from the bank will be required to follow buy america 
pay davis bacon prevailing wages 
utilize project labor agreements 
and ensure employers remain neutral in workers organizing efforts 
all federally supported infrastructure projects whether existing or newly developed financed through grants loans tax incentives or a national infrastructure bank should create good union jobs that expand the middle class 
that is why democrats will ensure labor protections davis bacon wage standards project labor agreements collective bargaining neutrality and domestic sourcing requirements are included in any infrastructure legislation 
and will block anti worker provisions including forced arbitration 
as we expand the clean energy technology 
and infrastructure industry 
we will fight to enact legislation that will drive the creation of family sustaining jobs with the high road labor standards with the provisions defined in the good jobs for the st century energy act 
democrats support transparent accountable and sound management of publicly owned infrastructure and assets 
and will ensure that local jurisdictions are adequately protected from partisan power grabs seeking to strip them of those assets 
we will ensure robust federal oversight of any proposed transfers of ownership or operations 
and will oppose any policy that promotes the privatization of public services or infrastructure 
democrats believe more products in our homes stores workplaces and communities should be stamped made in america 
and will expand support for american manufacturing 
we will end policies that incentivize offshoring 
and instead accelerate onshoring of critical supply chains including in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals 
we will expand effective tax credits that support domestic manufacturing 
and grow rural manufacturing jobs through investments in bio based manufacturing 
we will invest in innovation hubs and government programs to provide small manufacturers with technical and business expertise so they can grow their revenues and their workforces 
to ensure all workers can access the good jobs that will be created and supported by these investments and build a diverse pipeline of talent across the economy democrats will invest in career and technical education 
and high quality job training programs with formal worker representation in program development including pre apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships 
we believe in the value of lifelong learning and will increase investments to support adult literacy and other skills development programs 
democrats know that small businesses are among the best job creators in our country 
we will significantly boost funding for state small business grant and lending initiatives that generate tens of billions of dollars of private sector investment 
especially for small businesses owned by women and people of color 
we will increase access to credit for small businesses in low income and rural areas including for unbanked or underbanked businesses 
and we will increase funding for programs supporting businesses owned by women and people of color 
including ending the trump administration s effort to starve the minority business development agency 
improving and expanding small business administration sba programs that most effectively support women and minority owned businesses 
and increasing opportunities for women and minority owned businesses to obtain or participate in federal contracts 
that help protect clean air and water and support wildlife habitats including for threatened pollinators 
including by strengthening enforcement of the sherman and clayton antitrust acts 
democrats oppose the trump administration s efforts to undermine federal scientific research institutions apply political screens to research grants and interfere with the work of career scientists actions which have a chilling effect on scientific discovery 
and are damaging to america s economic competitiveness 
democrats will support historic federal investments in research development demonstration and deployment which will break new frontiers of science 
and create jobs across the country in aerospace artificial intelligence advanced materials biotechnology 
and clean energy and clean vehicles 
democrats support public investments in technology and innovation that help create a stronger economy for all americans 
we will support women innovators and innovators of color 
encourage diversity in technology 
and promote business models that reinvest in low income communities and communities of color 
democrats continue to support the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and are committed to continuing space exploration and discovery 
we believe in continuing the spirit of discovery that has animated nasa s human space exploration in addition to its scientific and medical research technological innovation and educational mission that allows us to better understand our own planet and place in the universe 
we will strengthen support for the united states role in space through our continued presence on the international space station 
working in partnership with the international community to continue scientific and medical innovation 
we support nasa s work to return americans to the moon and go beyond to mars taking the next step in exploring our solar system 
democrats additionally support strengthening nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s earth observation missions to better understand how climate change is impacting our home planet 
for too long the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to american workers 
too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs 
and too many countries have broken their promises to be honest and transparent partners 
the covid pandemic has shown the risks of relying too heavily on global supply chains as shutdowns and shortages have created chaos for workers and consumers 
and made our public health response even more challenging 
the trump administration has failed time after time to deliver for american workers on this crucial issue 
siding with corporate interests over our workers 
and launching a trade war with china that they have no plan for winning 
creating incredible hardship for american farmers manufacturers workers and consumers in the process 
democrats will pursue a trade policy that puts workers first 
we will negotiate strong and enforceable standards for labor 
and the environment in the core text of our trade deals 
future trade agreements should build on the pro labor provisions added to the united states mexico canada agreement usmca by democratic members of congress 
democrats will take aggressive action against china or any other country that tries to undercut american manufacturing by manipulating their currencies and maintaining a misaligned exchange rate with the dollar 
dumping products like steel and aluminum in our markets 
or providing unfair subsidies 
unlike president trump we will stand up to efforts from china and other state actors to steal america s intellectual property 
and will demand china and other countries cease and desist from conducting cyberespionage against our companies 
we will eliminate president trump s tax and trade policies that encourage big corporations to ship jobs overseas and evade paying their fair share of taxes 
if companies shut down their operations here and outsource jobs we ll claw back any public investments or benefits they received from taxpayers 
and yet it has never been in reach for all 
decades of red lining rising income inequality and predatory lending practices targeting low income families and people of color have made homeownership all but impossible for millions of working families 
homeownership has long been central to building generational wealth and expanding access to homeownership to those who have been unfairly excluded and discriminated against is critical to closing the racial wealth gap 
we have a nationwide shortage of affordable housing units 
homelessness has reached crisis proportions in a growing number of states 
and housing costs that rise faster than wages have put the squeeze on renters in many of our biggest cities 
no one should have to spend more than percent of their income on housing so families have ample resources left to meet their other needs and save for retirement 
democrats believe the government should take aggressive steps to increase the supply of housing especially affordable housing 
and address long standing economic and racial inequities in our housing markets 
we support innovative approaches to eliminating the racial wealth gap in america 
rehabilitating housing and expansion of housing owned by land trusts will increase the amount of housing available for secure homeownership 
we will equalize access to affordable credit 
and improve access to down payment assistance to help families of color low income families and rural buyers purchase homes 
we will increase funding for assistance to first time purchasers and homeowners to navigate the financing and servicing of their homes 
we will create a new tax credit of up to to help first time homebuyers 
and will make the tax credit refundable and advanceable so buyers can get assistance at the time of purchase instead of having to wait until they file their taxes 
democrats will supercharge investment in the housing trust fund to greatly expand the number of affordable accessible housing units on the market 
we will expand the low income housing tax credit to incentivize private sector construction of affordable housing 
and make sure urban suburban and rural areas all benefit 
and provide safe and healthy homes 
and democrats will leverage existing programs including at usda to build more affordable accessible housing 
and retrofit existing housing in rural areas 
we will ensure all federally supported housing projects from new builds to retrofits include mandatory requirements for labor standards 
accessibility 
and civil rights protections 
democrats are committed to ending homelessness in america 
democrats commit to providing section housing support for every eligible family 
and will enact protections to keep landlords from discriminating against voucher recipients 
we will increase investments in public housing to expand availability for the first time since the s 
and improve and upgrade existing public housing to ensure safe living conditions for residents 
protecting tenants rights to return if extensive renovations are needed 
democrats support a housing first approach to ending homelessness because having a stable and safe place to live is essential to helping a person tackle any other challenges they may face from mental illness to substance use disorders to post traumatic stress disorder 
we will act swiftly to end homelessness among veterans 
and will enact strong protections for lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer youth especially black latino and native american lgbtq youth who too often find themselves on the streets 
democrats will enact a new homeowner and renter bill of rights to protect families from abusive lenders and landlords 
we will empower renters by working to establish a national tenant right to organize 
and support outreach and education to help tenants advocate to preserve and expand affordable housing 
and democrats will provide legal support to fight wrongful evictions 
the trump administration has made matters worse by gutting fair lending and fair housing protections for homeowners 
democrats will vigorously enforce the fair housing act the home mortgage disclosure act the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule and the disparate impact standard 
and hold lenders accountable for discriminatory practices 
we will also ensure that federal housing programs are better designed to affirmatively further fair housing 
we will use the federal government to enforce settlements against discriminatory lenders

including exploring targeted rental relief when exorbitant rent increases force long term residents from their communities 
and tackling persistent racial bias in appraisals that contributes to the racial wealth gap 
time after time president trump and the republicans have rewarded big corporations and their wealthy donors and left working families behind

and by republican politicians who dole out tax cuts to their biggest donors while leaving working families to struggle 
democrats will take action to reverse the trump administration s tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest americans 
and rewarding corporations for shipping american jobs overseas 
we will crack down on overseas tax havens 
and close loopholes that are exploited by the wealthiest americans and biggest corporations 
we will make sure the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes 
we will make sure investors pay the same tax rates as workers 
and bring an end to expensive and unproductive tax loopholes including the carried interest loophole 
corporate tax rates which were cut sharply by the republican tax cut must be raised 
and trickle down tax cuts must be rejected 
estate taxes should also be raised back to the historical norm 
democrats will reform the tax code to be more progressive and equitable 
and reduce barriers for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks including the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit 
our program of reform will provide immediate marked relief for working families including more generous refundable tax credits to benefit low and middle income families

and providing more accessible tax breaks for homeownership

we will also give bankruptcy judges the authority to cram down or modify mortgages for primary residences during bankruptcy proceedings so working families can benefit from the same debt relief tools currently available to those who own assets like vacation homes and yachts 
democrats remain committed to ending poverty 
we recognize that the official poverty rate as measured and communicated by the federal government fails to capture critical needs like housing education health care transportation energy and other necessities and therefore understates the true share of americans living in poverty 
we will support the funding approach to direct at least percent of federal funding to communities where percent or more of the population has been living below the poverty line for years or longer 
directing more federal investment to the communities most in need will help create jobs 
improve and expand housing 
modernize and expand transportation clean water wastewater energy and broadband infrastructure 
and promote shared prosperity 
we will raise the minimum wage to an hour 
and guarantee equal pay for women

including bank accounts and real time payment systems through the federal reserve 
and easily accessible service locations like postal banking 
consumers workers students retirees and investors who have been mistreated by businesses should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law 
democrats will support efforts to eliminate the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts which unfairly strip consumers workers students retirees and investors of their right to their day in court 
in the st century and especially in the covid pandemic it is all but impossible for consumers students workers and people with disabilities to opt out of using the internet to shop socialize learn work bank and live 
while continuing to support and enable innovation 
and improve accessibility in the technology sector 
we will update the consumer privacy bill of rights proposed by the obama biden administration 
including adding strong national standards to protect consumers employees patients and students from data breaches 
and work with congress to pass it into law 
democrats will take additional steps to protect student data privacy particularly in preschool and k settings where most students are under 
and ensure that data collected in schools is used only for education not for commercial purposes 
and we support updating the electronic communications privacy act which has not been significantly amended since the s to afford the same protections to digital content as physical content 
democrats are concerned that the increase in corporate concentration across a wide range of industries from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to agribusiness and retail chains could be stifling competition and innovation and creating monopoly conditions that harm consumers 
we will direct federal regulators to review a subset of the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since president trump took office prioritizing the pharmaceutical health care telecommunications technology and agricultural industries to assess whether any have increased market concentration raised consumer prices demonstrably harmed workers increased racial inequality reduced competition or constricted innovation and assign appropriate remedies 
democrats will direct regulators to consider potential effects of future mergers on the labor market 
on low income and marginalized communities 
and on racial equity 
as well as on consumer prices and market competition 
and as a last resort regulators should consider breaking up corporations if they find they are using their market power to engage in anti competitive activities 
democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all 
we are the party that created and strengthened social security 
and defended public and private retirement plans that provide a decent monthly income 
and we are fighting to make sure that all workers have the ability to save at work for emergencies and for retirement 
social security is the most enduring thread in our nation s social safety net 
we will enact policies to make social security more progressive including increasing benefits for all beneficiaries 
meaningfully increasing minimum benefit payments 
increasing benefits for long duration beneficiaries 
and protecting surviving spouses from benefit cuts 
we will eliminate provisions that unfairly reduce public sector workers earned social security benefits 
in light of weakened retirement security for unpaid caregivers and caregivers for family members who sacrifice not only wages but social security benefits when they swap paid labor for unpaid care work democrats support social security reform which better accounts for the challenges facing unpaid caregivers 
including incremental reforms to the benefit formula to mitigate the penalty for unpaid care 
democrats will reject every effort to cut privatize or weaken social security including attempts to raise the retirement age diminish benefits by cutting cost of living adjustments or reduce earned benefits 
we will ensure social security will be there forever 
democrats will protect americans retirement security especially in the midst of the covid pandemic 
and take action to protect public and private pensions to ensure workers keep the benefits they have earned including through multiemployer plans 
democrats oppose changes to the multiemployer pension system that would endanger workers and retirees pensions including composite pension plans 
we support amending federal bankruptcy laws to protect workers earned pensions from being taken away by employers going through bankruptcy 
we will also make it easier to save for retirement beyond social security 
we will support approaches to retirement saving that enable workers and retirees to prepare for and prosper in retirement 
including reforms that will allow states and municipalities to create public individual and pooled retirement account options that are easy for workers to access and understand 
we will advocate federal legislation to make it easy for all workers to save not just those in states or municipalities that have established their own programs 
democrats believe that when workers are saving for retirement the financial advisors they consult should be legally obligated to put their client s best interests first 
we will take immediate action to reverse the trump administration s regulations allowing financial advisors to prioritize their self interest over their clients financial wellbeing 
and democrats will equalize the network of retirement savings tax breaks so that working people can build their nest eggs faster 
while also providing more equitable access to these accounts through automatic enrollment and relaxed contribution restrictions for unpaid caregivers 
democrats have fought to achieve universal health care for a century 
we are proud to be the party of medicare medicaid and the affordable care act 
because of the obama biden administration and the affordable care act more than million americans with pre existing conditions from heart disease to asthma are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them 
women can no longer be charged more than men just because of their gender 
and more americans are able to get health coverage than ever before 
democrats will keep up the fight until all americans can access secure affordable high quality health insurance 
because as democrats we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all not a privilege for the few 
unfortunately at every turn democrats efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by obstruction and opposition from the republican party 
it has been republicans who have embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre existing conditions 
it was republican state attorneys general who sued to block medicaid expansion and republican governors who refused to extend medicaid coverage to their citizens leaving millions of low income americans disproportionately people of color unable to access health coverage 
and in the midst of the worst global pandemic in generations one that has left more than americans dead and counting the trump administration is fighting in court to invalidate the entirety of the affordable care act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people 
the burdens of this pandemic have not been borne equally as communities of color have suffered higher rates of infection and death 
and struggled to access life saving care when they need it most 
we are going to at last build the health care system the american people have always deserved one that finally provides universal health care coverage 
reduces prescription drug prices premiums and out of pocket costs 
reins in overall health care expenses 
and tackles the deep seated inequities in our health care system 
we will build a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and the people who care for them instead of the profit motives of corporations 
we will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care 
reduce prescription drug prices by standing up to big pharmaceutical companies 
and make it easier to access mental health and substance use disorder treatment and long term services and supports in metropolitan and rural areas alike 
democrats will always fight to save americans lives by making it easier and more affordable to go to the doctor get prescription medicines and access preventive testing and treatments 
we are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the affordable care act and those who support a medicare for all approach 
all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right 
democrats believe we need to protect strengthen and build upon our bedrock health care programs including the affordable care act medicare medicaid and the veterans affairs va system 
private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable quality coverage to every american 
to achieve that objective we will give all americans the choice to select a high quality affordable public option through the affordable care act marketplace 
the public option will provide at least one plan choice without deductibles 
will be administered by cms not private companies 
and will cover all primary care without any co payments and control costs for other treatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals just like medicare does on behalf of older people 
everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another affordable care act marketplace plan 
to help close the persistent racial gap in insurance rates democrats will expand funding for affordable care act outreach and enrollment programs so every american knows their options for securing quality affordable coverage 
the lowest income americans including more than four million adults who should be eligible for medicaid but who live in states where republican governors have refused to expand the program will be automatically enrolled in the public option without premiums 
they may opt out at any time 
and we will enable millions of older workers to choose between their employer provided plans the public option or enrolling in medicare when they turn instead of having to wait until they are 
democrats are categorically opposed to raising the medicare retirement age 
democrats will also empower the states as laboratories of democracy to use affordable care act innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage 
including by removing barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care approaches 
we also know that finally covering every american through the public and private insurance system alone is not enough to guarantee universal access 
that is why democrats support doubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban and rural areas 
including increased support for dental care mental health care and substance use services like medication assisted treatment 
and why we will increase support for mobile health clinics 
we will enact longer multi year funding cycles for these critical health services so they can operate with greater certainty 
as community health centers are the nation s only providers that are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas 
and required to serve all who seek care regardless of their ability to pay 
and we will leverage innovative payment options through medicare and medicaid to help community health centers and rural health clinics keep their doors open 
we will expand the national health service corps and teaching health center graduate medical education program to grow a diverse primary care workforce 
and to address critical shortages of health care providers in medically underserved rural and urban areas 
including primary care nurses dental professionals and mental health and substance use counselors 
democrats will also increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure that health care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities 
too many americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy 
no american should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can t afford to pay 
especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development of many prescription drugs in the first place 
democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that americans do not pay more for prescription drugs than people in other advanced economies 
and ensure that all necessary medications are covered 
we will empower medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all public and private purchasers for families and businesses as well as older americans no matter where they get their coverage 
we will also prevent the price of brand name and outlier generic drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate 
we will cap out of pocket drug costs for seniors 
and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost 
for too long prescription drug companies have gamed the system to justify their price increases by any means available 
democrats will crack down on anti competitive efforts to manipulate the patent system or collude on prices 
and we will eliminate tax breaks for prescription drug advertisements 
democrats know we can reduce out of pocket costs for families while improving the quality of health care for all 
we will make it easier for working families to afford high quality insurance in the affordable care act marketplaces by ensuring that no one pays more than percent of their income in premiums 
and eliminating the cap on subsidies 
democrats believe that when americans are in the hospital or an emergency room they shouldn t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in network or not which is why we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing 
we will work to increase price transparency in the health care system across all payers 
and reduce paperwork through uniform medical billing 
and we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega mergers in the hospital insurance and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by undermining market competition 
excessive prescription drug cost sharing and voids in coverage such as dental vision and hearing services can lead to severe health consequences for medicare patients 
democrats will fight any efforts to cut medicare benefits 
and support finding financially sustainable policies to expand medicare to cover dental vision and hearing 
democrats will support policies that increase the number of primary care practitioners registered nurses dentists and dental therapists especially in rural and low income metropolitan areas so it s easier for every american to access preventive and primary health care 
democrats value all people 
and will actively promote wellness programs for all ages in our diverse communities for better overall health 
every american who needs it should be able to access mental health care or substance use disorder treatment no matter where they live 
democrats will aggressively enforce the federal mental health and substance use disorder parity law 
and ensure that health insurers adequately cover mental health and substance use treatment 
we will also invest in training and hiring more mental health providers substance use disorder counselors and peer support counselors 
including by expanding funding for health clinics especially in rural areas 
and increasing access to these services through medicaid 
trauma has a profound effect on both mental and physical health and democrats will support increased training for health care professionals educators social workers and other care workers in trauma informed care and practices 
we will oppose efforts to weaken hipaa and ferpa privacy rights of people with mental illness 
democrats will make medication assisted treatment available to all who need it 
and will require publicly supported health clinics to offer medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction 
and approved treatments for other substance use disorders 
we believe we must stop over prescribing while improving access to effective and needed pain management 
democrats recognize that incarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates than the general population which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens 
harm reduction interventions 
and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders 
the covid pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of people who reside in institutional settings such as nursing homes and independent living facilities 
and made clear that biases within medicaid create undue barriers to home and community based long term services and supports 
democrats will work to eliminate waiting lists for home and community based care 
and the institutional bias within medicaid 
making investments in building the capacity of the medicaid system to provide home and community based services 
we will modernize medicaid eligibility so people with disabilities do not have to work low wage jobs to access needed services 
and to ensure the spouses of people with disabilities can maintain a certain level of income and assets 
we will also help americans pay for long term care by creating a tax credit for informal and family caregivers 
and increasing the child and dependent care tax credit 
democrats will also pursue policies to improve nursing home staffing and quality standards 
strengthen accreditation processes 
and combat corporate abuses in nursing homes and independent living facilities 
and democrats are strongly committed to protecting and enforcing the americans with disabilities act 
and fulfilling the promise of the olmstead v l c decision which found institutional segregation of people with disabilities to be unlawful 
even before the covid pandemic the uninsured rate was nearly three times higher for latinos and nearly twice as high for black americans as it was for whites 
some segments of the asian american and pacific islander population faced uninsured rates rivaling those of black americans and latinos 
and more than one in five native americans and alaska natives was uninsured 
black children are far more likely than white children to suffer from asthma 
latinos native americans asian americans and pacific islanders and black americans are diagnosed with diabetes at higher rates than whites 
and average life expectancy is more than two years lower for rural americans compared to those who live in metropolitan areas 
we recognize it is not enough to have a commitment to eliminating health disparities we must have a plan 
that is why democrats will launch a sustained government wide effort with leadership at the highest levels to eliminate racial ethnic gender and geographic gaps in insurance rates access to quality care and health outcomes 
that includes tackling the social economic and environmental inequities the social determinants of health like poor housing hunger inadequate transportation mass incarceration air and water pollution and gun violence 
that contribute to worse health outcomes for low income americans and people of color 
we can and must fix these inequities by expanding coverage 
making health care more affordable 
and tackling implicit bias in our health care system 
democrats will ensure that people with disabilities are never denied coverage based on the use of quality adjusted life year qaly indexes 
democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race gender sexual orientation gender identity geography disability status national origin and other important variables so that disparities in health coverage access and outcomes can be better understood and addressed 
we will expand access to health care for people living and working across the united states by extending affordable care act coverage to dreamers 
and working with congress to lift the five year waiting period for medicaid and children s health insurance program eligibility for low income lawfully present immigrants

native american tribes have for too long been forced to cope with insufficient access to health care and mental health services 
nutrition services 
and modern infrastructure 
and will invest significant new resources in clean water and wastewater infrastructure 
clean energy generation and distribution 
and we will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the indian health service 
democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health rights and justice 
we believe unequivocally like the majority of americans that every woman should be able to access high quality reproductive health care services 
including safe and legal abortion 
we will repeal the title x domestic gag rule 
and restore federal funding for planned parenthood 
which provides vital preventive and reproductive health care for millions of people especially low income people and people of color and lgbtq people including in underserved areas 
democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights 
we will repeal the hyde amendment 
and protect and codify the right to reproductive freedom 
we condemn acts of violence harassment and intimidation of reproductive health providers patients and staff 
we will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services including those based on gender sexual orientation gender identity race income disability geography and other factors 
democrats oppose restrictions on medication abortion care that are inconsistent with the most recent medical and scientific evidence and that do not protect public health 
we recognize that quality affordable comprehensive health care 
medically accurate lgbtq inclusive age appropriate sex education 
and the full range of family planning services are all essential to ensuring that people can decide if when and how to start a family 
which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis of sex 
and requires insurers to cover prescription contraceptives at no cost 
these efforts have significantly reduced teen and unintended pregnancies by making it easier to decide whether when and how to have a child 
we believe that a person s health should always come first 
democrats will protect the rights of all people to make personal health care decisions 
and will reject the trump administration s use of broad exemptions to allow medical providers employers and others to discriminate

including adoption and social support services 
as well as protections against pregnancy discrimination

including the dangerous and unethical regulations allowing doctors hospitals and insurance companies to discriminate against patients based on their sexual orientation or gender identity 
democrats will reverse this rulemaking and restore nondiscrimination protections for lgbtq people and people living with hiv aids in health insurance 
including coverage of all medically necessary care for gender transition 
we will also take action to guarantee that lgbtq people and those living with hiv aids have full access to needed health care and resources 
including by requiring that federal health plans provide coverage for hiv aids testing and treatment and hiv prevention medications like prep and pep gender confirmation surgery and hormone therapy 
democrats support increased community hiv prevention and testing programs which target latino black asian american and pacific islander native american and other at risk communities to address the increases of hiv 
democrats will recommit the federal government to ending the hiv aids epidemic by 
we will work to ensure blood donation regulations are based on science not fiction or stigma 
and that no american when seeking to donate blood will face more stringent limitations than any other simply because of who they are 
the covid pandemic has made plain to people across the country that our health care workers are heroes 
our doctors and nurses our home health aides and physician s assistants our public health professionals our home care workers and nursing home workers and our cleaners and service workers have shown up to work every day despite dire shortages of personal protective equipment 
far too many of them have lost their lives to this terrible disease 
and untold thousands are suffering the mental and emotional strain of losing far too many patients 
and yet despite the critical role they play in our society and our economy these frontline workers a majority of whom are women of color are often underpaid 
and lack access to paid sick days paid family and medical leave health insurance and other benefits critical for their own health and the health of patients 
democrats believe that all jobs in the caring economy must come with family sustaining wages good benefits access to paid leave fair and predictable schedules access to training and professional development and the ability to join a union and collectively bargain 
we believe all employers funded by taxpayer dollars must pay their workers at least an hour 
and protect workers rights to organize 
although health care jobs are among the fastest growing in the economy demand for services still far outstrips supply especially in primary care 
we will invest in community health worker care forces around the nation proven to prevent manage and better treat chronic illnesses 
and empower first time mothers with home visiting 
we will close provider gaps and increase diversity in the health care profession by creating a robust pipeline of talent with career ladders for advancement 
and we will also increase opportunities for community health workers to come from the communities they serve

and federal grants across agencies including at the national cancer institute and other components of the national institutes of health nih the cdc and the agency for health care research and quality 
we will increase the federal investment in research and development for new medications through the nih 
and make sure that there is a return on that investment for taxpayers 
we will also build on the foundation of the obama biden administration s cancer moonshot to break down silos and accelerate research into cancer and cancer treatments by creating an agency with the sole mission of finding new cures and treatments for cancer and other diseases 
democrats also support increasing funding for research into health disparities by race ethnicity gender gender identity sexual orientation age geographic area and socioeconomic status with a particular focus on how the social determinants of health contribute to differences in health outcomes

democrats will take steps to increase the diversity of principal investigators receiving federal grants 
as well as of participants in federally supported clinical trials

the trump administration s systematic efforts to undermine discredit dismiss fire disempower and diminish the contributions of scientists in health science and other disciplines have weakened our public institutions 
slowed the pace of scientific inquiry 
democrats will protect the independence and intellectual freedom of scientists whether they are employed by the federal government or receiving federal grants in support of their research 
and take steps to shield our scientific research agencies from future political interference 
and cut public services 
democrats also recognize that all too often systematic cuts to public services have left police officers on the front lines of responding to social challenges for which they have not been trained from homelessness to mental health crises to the opioid epidemic 
this is the moment to root out structural and systemic racism in our criminal justice system and our society 
democrats believe we must break the school to prison pipeline that too often relies on arrests and law enforcement to address misbehavior that ought to be handled and deescalated within the school 
we support re issuing federal guidance from the department of education and the department of justice to prevent the disparate disciplinary treatment of children of color and children with disabilities in school and educational settings 
democrats believe every school should have sufficient funding to employ guidance counselors social workers nurses or school psychologists to help guarantee age appropriate and racially equitable student disciplinary practices rather than turning to police to resolve these issues

community centers 
and summer jobs to provide opportunities for young people at risk 
and we will ban racial and religious profiling in law enforcement

disproportionately black people and latinos 
including by making evidence based investments in jobs 
housing 
education 
and the arts 
democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve 
and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use 
equal justice under the law should not be contingent on the ability to pay for quality legal representation 
which is why we support increasing funding for public defenders and for the legal services corporation 
we denounce president trump s inappropriate use of clemency to help his friends and political cronies avoid justice 
we also support establishing an independent clemency board to ensure an appropriate effective process for using clemency 
especially to address systemic racism and other priorities 
private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services including in the criminal justice system 
increasing support for programs that provide educational opportunities including pursuing college degrees for those in the criminal justice system both in prison and upon release

including brown v board of education

we believe black lives matter 
and will establish a national commission to examine the lasting economic effects of slavery jim crow segregation and racially discriminatory federal policies on income wealth educational health and employment outcomes 
to pursue truth and promote racial healing 
and to study reparations

including policies that provide seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership 
the right to organize and collectively bargain benefits all workers but especially for workers of color 
unions close pay gaps between white workers and people of color 
the union wage premium is high for all workers but remains especially substantial for people of color including latinos and black workers 
this is one reason why black workers represent a higher share of the labor movement than the workforce as a whole 
unemployment rates for people of color are persistently higher than the national average which is why democrats support making racial equity part of the mandate of the federal reserve 
specifically we will work with congress to direct the chair of the federal reserve to report on the extent of racial employment and wage gaps and how the central bank is countering them 
in addition to monitoring reporting on and responding to macroeconomic conditions in general

improving federal support and access to credit for women and minority owned small businesses 
expanding and making permanent the new markets tax credit

and the exorbitant costs of safe quality child care present a significant economic burden to families 
democrats support making child care and dependent tax credits significantly more generous 
and will increase funding to states to guarantee that low income and middle class families can afford child care 
we will make major investments to increase quality options for parents 
and increase compensation for providers 
democrats also support expanding proven programs for low income and first time parents guardians and caregivers 
including home visiting that can help connect families in need to child care education and child development opportunities and improve outcomes for children and parents alike 
democrats also support raising early childhood standards 
and providing ongoing professional development for early childhood educators 
to ensure that children s academic social development behavioral and cognitive needs are being met 
democrats believe that early childhood educators like all educators and all workers should be paid a family supporting wage 
have access to benefits 
and paid leave 
and be able to organize join a union and collectively bargain for better wages benefits and working conditions 
each year the united states spends billion more on schools in predominantly white districts than in non white districts 
using property taxes to fund public k schools results in inequitable treatment for students in low income school districts compared to those in wealthier areas 
democrats are committed to closing the school funding gap by tripling title i funding which benefits schools that serve low income students 
and incentivizing states to adopt progressive funding formulas that direct resources to the schools that need it most 
we will also ensure sustainable reliable funding for rural schools schools in impoverished urban areas impacted by gentrification and bureau of indian education schools 
as the covid pandemic has made plain our public schools are more than places where children learn they are pillars of our neighborhoods and our society 
democrats believe that no student should ever be shamed over school lunch debt and support expanding universal free school meal programs 
we will also support wraparound health care and nutrition services before and after school programs adult education classes and other services by significantly expanding the community school model 
students should have multiple public school pathways to be able to access the opportunities they deserve 
democrats will work to expand access to career and technical education magnet schools for science and the arts international baccalaureate programs and early college high schools to offer multiple pathways to meet the diverse needs and interests of america s high school students 
we will increase investments in high quality science technology engineering and mathematics programs in our public schools 
support access to computer science for all 
and improve professional development opportunities for math and science teachers 
including through the creation of a national science corps of outstanding stem teachers serving as leaders in their schools and communities 
democrats believe we must prioritize steam education 
and funding for underrepresented students including students of color girls and low income students to help remove enrollment and achievement barriers 
we will equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand complex scientific issues 
counter the rising tide of denialism by promoting environmental and climate literacy 
and reverse the trump administration s cuts to the national environmental education act 
in addition to developing strong literacy numeracy and steam skills our education system should develop the deep learning and life skills needed to thrive in the st century economy including critical and creative thinking leadership and judgment and decision making 
charter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations 
democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive which is why we will ban for profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding 
and we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds 
we support measures to increase accountability for charter schools including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools 
including with regard to civil rights protections racial equity admissions practices disciplinary procedures and school finances 
we will call for conditioning federal funding for new expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students 
and democrats oppose private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer funded resources away from the public school system 
including the program at issue in the recent espinoza decision 
democrats are committed to safe and supportive school climates for students and educators alike 
democrats also believe that all schools should have adequate resources to expand school based health services 
and hire guidance counselors social workers nurses and school psychologists to help support students mental health needs address trauma and promote social and emotional development 
we will work with school administrators educators students and mental health advocates to reduce the stigma that too often prevents students from seeking out these resources 
democrats will make sure schools do not engage in and appropriately address discrimination bullying and harassment related to sex including sexual orientation and gender identity race national origin immigration or citizenship status religion disability and language status 
we will protect the rights of transgender students 
it is unacceptable that america s public schools are more racially segregated today than they were in the late s 
schools and classrooms and programs within schools continue to be segregated by race and class 
and with increasing frequency students are being unnecessarily and unlawfully segregated by disability language status and through the use of exclusionary discipline and school based arrests 
we believe that schools must no longer engage in segregation and segregative practices 
democrats support appointing judges who will enforce the civil rights act in schools 
we will fund federal programs to promote integration and school diversity including magnet schools and school transportation initiatives 
we will also reinvigorate and increase funding for the department of education s office of civil rights 
expand the civil rights data collection to inform civil rights enforcement and the public on the status of equal educational opportunity for all children 
and build on the strength in diversity act to increase federal funding for community driven strategies to desegregate schools 
all children have the constitutional right to go to school 
we recognize the need for significantly increased funding and support for english learners to ensure they can participate meaningfully and equally in school 
including through public meetings and community decision making mechanisms 
democrats believe in providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities 
we will fully fund the individuals with disabilities education act 
and fully implement its requirements for a free appropriate public education and least restrictive environment 
we will support aggressive enforcement of section of the rehabilitation act and the americans with disabilities act including the integration mandate of the olmstead decision 
and provide school districts with additional resources to better serve students with disabilities 
we will ban seclusion and prevent and decrease use of physical restraint in partnership with teachers school administrators and the disability rights movement 
democrats also support aggressive enforcement of the americans with disabilities act in schools and other settings 
the covid pandemic has made long standing educational disparities evident to all americans 
democrats will prioritize equitable education and access for students with disabilities english language learners low income students students of color and urban and rural students including those who are homeless are immigrants or refugees or are in the foster care or juvenile justice systems 
remote instruction must be individualized to the greatest possible extent 
and reasonable modifications should be provided for students with disabilities even during a pandemic 
the evidence from nearly two decades of education reforms that hinge on standardized test scores shows clearly that high stakes testing has not led to enough improvement in outcomes for students or for schools 
and can lead to discrimination against students particularly students with disabilities students of color low income students and english language learners 
democrats will work to end the use of such high stakes tests and encourage states to develop reliable continuous evidence based approaches to student assessment that rely on multiple and holistic measures that better represent student achievement 
assessments will provide families with clear accessible consistent information about how well schools are serving individual students and groups of students while better representing student achievement 
students parents and educators will be supported by data collection and analysis disaggregated by race gender disability status and other important variables to identify and address disparities in educational equity access and outcomes 
educators have always been heroes 
the covid pandemic has made the value that educators provide to children parents and the economy obvious as never before to tens of millions of americans 
public school educators should have the same rights to organize join a union and collectively bargain as private sector workers 
democrats will fight to significantly increase pay and benefits for all educators in order to help recruit retain and reward high quality teachers and support professionals 
and will continue to support measures to help teachers pay for out of pocket classroom expenses 
we will support programs to help introduce high school students to the teaching profession 
enable school support staff to climb the professional ladder within schools 
and recruit a diverse educational workforce through partnerships with hbcus msis and tcus 
democrats believe that everyone should be able to earn a degree beyond high school if they choose to without money standing in the way 
that is why we will make public colleges and universities tuition free for students whose families earn less than roughly percent of the american people 
we will double the maximum pell grant award for low income students 
and double federal support for trio programs that help first generation college students students with disabilities veterans and other underrepresented groups apply to and complete college 
hbcus msis and tcus serve a disproportionate number of low income students who might otherwise be unable to access a college degree and yet these vital institutions are chronically under resourced 
democrats will work to provide grants to hbcus msis and tcus to lower student costs 
increase academic research capabilities 
and ensure these essential institutions can continue to thrive in the future 
democrats support making community colleges and trade schools tuition free for all students including dreamers 
our nation s network of two year community colleges provides accessible high quality education for students of all ages 
democrats will additionally support and expand pre apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships with formal worker representation in program development to provide a clear pathway to high quality jobs that does not require attending college 
we will increase federal support for services like child care on college campuses so more students are able to balance the demands of school and family and graduate with degrees 
democrats also support increased funding for wraparound services including covering the cost of textbooks and fees for low income students and establishing programs to address campus food insecurity so students can focus on what matters most their studies 
democrats will fight to create a federal funding program for higher education modeled on title i funding for k schools that would direct funds to public and nonprofit colleges and universities and minority serving institutions based on the proportion of low income students those schools enroll and graduate 
we will promote transparency and fairness regarding higher education faculty working conditions 
including adjuncts graduate employees and full time lecturers who are often grossly underpaid compared to full professors 
and support and encourage professor tenure 
and democrats will safeguard academic freedom on college campuses 
democrats oppose the trump administration s cruel and capricious treatment of international students studying in the united states during the covid pandemic 
democrats are committed to policies that make the united states welcoming to the more than one million international students who come to study in our colleges and universities annually 
and the higher education sector as part of the recovery from the covid pandemic 
student debt is holding millions of americans back 
the covid pandemic and president trump s recession are making it harder for those with student loans to make ends meet right now 
democrats will work to authorize up to in student debt relief per borrower to help families weather this crisis 
beyond that immediate relief democrats will also take steps to ease the burden of high monthly student loan payments through legislative and administration relief processes 
including creating a simplified repayment process 
democrats will work to pause monthly billing 
and stop interest from accruing on federal student loans for people earning less than 
and cap payments at no more than five percent of discretionary income for those earning more than 
after years remaining federal student loan debt should be automatically forgiven without tax liability 
for those earning less than we support forgiving all undergraduate tuition related federal student debt from two and four year public colleges and universities 
and we will also apply this benefit to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private hbcus and msis 
democrats support modernizing and improving the public service loan forgiveness program 
including making the enrollment process automatic for people who work in schools government agencies and non profit organizations 
we will also make the program more generous by forgiving up to in student debt per year for up to five years 
and apply this action to people who have already dedicated years or less of service to working in our schools government agencies and non profit organizations 
we reject republican proposals that in the name of simplification would make students pay billions of dollars more on their student loans 
not only will these measures make it easier for americans to buy a home or start a small business 
student debt forgiveness is key to helping address the racial wealth gap 
as students of color are more likely to have to borrow to finance higher education 
democrats will also empower the cfpb to take action against exploitative lenders 
and will work with congress to allow student debt to be discharged during bankruptcy 
the trump administration has let for profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections 
democrats will crack down on predatory for profit higher education programs 
including by issuing requirements that these programs be able to demonstrate their value and effectiveness before becoming eligible for federal student loans 
we will call upon the secretary of education to forgive debt carried by students who were ripped off by predatory schools including by programs that defrauded students or that misrepresented program offerings or program outcomes 
as well as debt held by people who are permanently disabled 
and we will protect veterans and servicemembers from being steered into low performing for profit higher education and professional programs 
our country is less safe 
our economy more fragile 
rather than advance our interests and values in a more competitive world president trump has retreated allowing our adversaries to fill the void 
he has attacked the sources of our strength 
hollowed out american diplomacy 
shredded international commitments 
weakened our alliances 
and tarnished our credibility 
rather than make smart investments to keep our military s competitive edge president trump has wasted billions on vanity projects 
barred patriotic americans from serving their country 
denied military families the care and support they have earned 
and tried to use our women and men in uniform to sow fear and division 
rather than help americans compete in the global economy he s launched reckless politically motivated tariff wars 
that have punished american workers 
antagonized our allies 
and benefited our adversaries 
rather than end our forever wars he s brought us to the brink of new conflicts 
and further militarized our foreign policy 
rather than reduce nuclear dangers he s amplified them and brought the world closer to catastrophe 
rather than stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies and partners he s betrayed them 
rather than root out corruption he s made common cause with kleptocrats 
rather than fight the existential threat of climate change he s denied science and accelerated the damage 
in every region and on every issue american security and interests are at greater peril and our rivals at greater advantage than four years ago 
we will revitalize the power and purpose of american diplomacy to compete in a more contested world 
and we will reinvent alliances partnerships and international institutions to meet common challenges that no country can face on its own 
the world today looks very different from the post wwii period that gave birth to our alliance system 
but these changes make our alliances more not less crucial to our success 
we will ensure that our military has no peer 
we owe it to our men and women in uniform and to the american public to spend our defense dollars more wisely and strategically 
focused on building a force that can deter and win the conflicts of the st century 
and we will use force only when necessary always as a last resort 
we will root a disciplined foreign policy in the needs and aspirations of the american middle class 
democrats will revitalize american diplomacy to ensure that the united states remains the world s pivotal power 
and a principled force for peace and prosperity 
the united states should be at the head of the table whenever the safety and well being of americans is at stake 
working in common cause with our allies and partners 
time and again the trump administration has stormed out leaving america s seat at the table vacant and american interests on the menu 
democrats believe that diplomacy should be our tool of first resort 
the world s greatest power deserves to have the world s very best diplomatic corps 
but today american diplomacy is badly adrift and under resourced 
and our diplomats are demoralized 
democrats will support and invest in long overdue reforms to make the state department more strategic modern agile and effective 
rather than militarize our foreign policy treat our diplomats with contempt and call for reckless budget cuts democrats will put diplomacy back in the hands of professionals 
and ensure they are better prepared to advance american interests on the central issues of our time like disruptive technology and climate change 
we will recruit a new generation of americans who want to serve their country abroad 
and ensure they have the training and tools they need 
and we will expand and reform the foreign service so it reflects the diversity and richness of the country it represents 
democrats believe america s alliances are an irreplaceable cornerstone of our national security that should be cultivated not cast away 
our allies offer an enormous strategic advantage that our rivals can t match 
they multiply our influence spread our reach lighten our burden and advance our shared interests and priorities much farther than we could ever do on our own 
president trump has undermined our alliances in ways that our adversaries could have only dreamed of sowing doubts about our commitments to diplomatic agreements mutual defense democratic values and strategic purpose 
as a result our alliance system today faces its biggest test since the end of the cold war 
he has pushed to bring russia back into the g 
while lambasting our nato partners 
and ignoring intelligence about russian bounties for killing american troops and other coalition forces in afghanistan 
he has undermined confidence in america s commitment to the alliance s article mutual defense provision 
and threatened to pull troops out of germany without consultation 
in the midst of a nuclear crisis on the korean peninsula he tried to extort our south korean allies to dramatically increase their share of alliance costs 
democrats will not only repair our alliances but reinvent them to advance mutual priorities and deal with new challenges 
we will make developing shared responses to non military threats like disinformation corruption and economic coercion priorities in our agenda 
we will work with our partners to improve interoperability 
and we will encourage them to build up their defense capabilities 
take greater responsibility for regional security 
and contribute their fair share 
but we will never treat our alliances like protection rackets 
democrats will not only reinvent existing alliances 
but also work to strengthen and build new partnerships in regions of growing strategic importance 
particularly in africa 
and latin america 
democrats believe that american security and prosperity are enhanced when the united states leads in shaping the rules forging the agreements and steering the institutions that guide international relations 
we believe the system of international institutions we built and led over the past seven decades has generated an enormous return on our investment 
and in today s more competitive world its renovation is a critical diplomatic priority 
unfortunately president trump has orchestrated an american retreat from global bodies that weakens our influence 
cedes ground to our adversaries 
and puts global peace and prosperity in jeopardy 
instead of walking away democrats believe the united states should lead the way and mobilize our partners to work in common cause 
we will rejoin and reform the who 
the united nations human rights council 
and the united nations population fund 
we will work to modernize international institutions to make sure they are fit for purpose in the st century 
and responsible stewards of both public funds and the world s trust 
democrats believe that foreign assistance and development programs are powerful tools for promoting american and global security and prosperity 
with less than one percent of its annual budget the united states gets an extraordinary return on its investments in the prevention and alleviation of poverty hunger disease and conflict 
the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations 
and the opening of global markets for american business and exports to thrive 
that s why we will ensure that the u s agency for international development usaid reclaims its position as the world s premier development agency 
and it s why we reject the trump administration s punitive and transactional approach to foreign aid 
democrats will devote the resources and implement the reforms necessary to further multiply the impact of foreign assistance 
we will reaffirm america s commitment to the united nations sustainable development goals 
and help identify areas for strategic investment 
we will incorporate local perspectives including from civil society partners into the design execution and evaluation of our programs to secure lasting impact 
and we will provide the budgetary support and statutory authorities necessary to make sure our aid institutions including the new u s international development finance corporation are successfully integrated into broader international and private sector development efforts 
democrats will lead international efforts to help developing countries withstand and recover from debt crises caused by the covid pandemic 
and we will push for international standards that establish more transparency and sustainability in development financing 
democrats believe our military is and must be the most effective fighting force in the world 
to keep it that way we need to bring our forever wars to a responsible end 
rationalize our defense budget 
invest in the forces and technologies of the future 
repair civil military relations 
and strengthen our covenant with service members veterans and military families 
democrats know it s time to bring nearly two decades of unceasing conflict to an end 
our military engagements which have spanned from west africa to southeast asia have cost more than trillion 
and claimed more than half a million lives 
our war in afghanistan is the longest war in american history with the youngest u s troops now fighting a war that was launched before they were even born 
president trump said he would get the united states out of these wars but instead he deployed more combat forces expanded their missions 
and stoked regional tensions that unnecessarily endangered american lives and interests 
democrats will deliver on this overdue commitment to end the forever wars and we will do it responsibly setting priorities 
leading with diplomacy 
protecting ourselves from terrorist threats 
enabling local partners 
and bringing our troops home 
democrats are committed to a durable and inclusive political settlement in afghanistan that ensures that al qaeda isn t allowed to reconstitute 
the islamic state isis isn t allowed to grow 
and the international community can help afghans safeguard hard fought gains 
especially for women and girls 
democrats will end support for the saudi led war in yemen 
and help bring the war to an end 
this war is responsible for the world s worst humanitarian crisis 
and it amplifies threats to the region and to our interests 
democrats believe that the united states should support diplomatic efforts not block them 
democrats will not only end the wars that have cost so much american blood and treasure we will apply their lessons 
we will only use force when necessary to protect national security and when the objective is clear and achievable 
that is why we will work with congress to repeal decades old authorizations for the use of military force 
and replace them with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect americans from terrorist threats 
while ending the forever wars 
rather than occupy countries and overthrow regimes to prevent terrorist attacks democrats will prioritize more effective and less costly diplomatic intelligence and law enforcement tools 
we will right size our counterterrorism footprint 
put it in service of broader regional and overarching foreign policy objectives 
and ensure it never undermines the values we seek to uphold 
and we will mobilize our partners to make sustained investments that can prevent conflict 
and help extinguish the flames on which extremists feed 
democrats believe the united states military should be the best trained best equipped and most effective fighting force in the world 
ending the forever wars 
reducing the enormous stress on our forces 
and rationalizing our global military footprint 
are essential prerequisites to securing our competitive edge but they re not enough 
we will invest in technology and forces that meet the threats of the future from cyber to space and artificial intelligence to unmanned systems 
and reinforce the alliances and partnerships that enhance our collective security 
rather than continuing to rely on legacy platforms that are increasingly exposed and vulnerable democrats support funding a more cost effective agile flexible and resilient force with modern transportation and logistics capabilities that can operate in more contested environments 
democrats will accelerate defense transformation in a responsible ethical way 
and with strong privacy protections 
and we believe the implications of climate change for national security and the department of defense can no longer be an afterthought 
but must be at the core of all policy and operational plans to secure our vital interests 
democrats believe the measure of our security is not how much we spend on defense but how we spend our defense dollars 
and in what proportion to other tools in our foreign policy toolbox and other urgent domestic investments 
we believe we can and must ensure our security while restoring stability predictability and fiscal discipline in defense spending 
we spend times more on the military than we do on diplomacy 
we spend five times more in afghanistan each year than we do on global public health and preventing the next pandemic 
we can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less 
it s past time to rebalance our investments 
improve the efficiency and competitiveness of our defense industrial base 
conduct rigorous annual audits of the pentagon 
and end waste and fraud 
democrats believe that our force is stronger when it reflects the richness and diversity of american society 
and when we treat our service members veterans and their families with the dignity they ve earned 
we will protect and enhance opportunities for anyone who can meet the standards to serve in combat roles 
we will reverse the trump administration s hateful transgender ban 
discriminatory exclusions in military health care 
and policies that stigmatize and discriminate against people living with hiv and aids 
and ensure that lgbtq service members and families enjoy equal respect benefits and care 
we will root out systemic racism from our military justice system where black service members are twice as likely as white ones to face court martial 
we will accelerate efforts to recruit and promote people of color in the officer corps

including reproductive services 
and that every veteran receives comprehensive and culturally competent care and benefits regardless of their ethnicity race gender identity or sexual orientation 
and eliminate transgender exclusions 
we will combat veteran homelessness 
including by converting va facilities into housing 
twenty veterans and service members take their life every day 
we will treat suicide as the public health crisis it is 
today only half of afghanistan and iraq veterans have access to the mental health services they need 
that s why we will invest in mental health and suicide prevention services 
and work with our military communities to encourage and support those seeking help connecting them to critical services 
democrats will provide the hundreds of thousands of service members that transition to civilian life with the support they need 
democrats will not abide exploitation of our veterans especially by for profit colleges that raid benefits and burden veterans with debt 
democrats believe that we can t maintain the force we need unless we take care of military families who have been asked to endure so much for so long with far too little support 
no military family should struggle to pay their bills put food on the table or access health care quality housing child care or the workforce 
we will ensure pay and compensation keep pace with the current economy 
we will also increase time between deployments 
improve educational outcomes for military children 
and invest in career training education and entrepreneurship programs for military spouses who face an unemployment rate twice the national average 
we will expand tax credits to help family caregivers of our veterans 
and ensure they receive the support they need from the va and department of defense

and to the strength and effectiveness of our military 
we will end the trump administration s politicization of the armed forces 
and distortion of civilian and military roles in decision making 
and appropriately incorporate military advice 
democrats will never use active duty soldiers as political props 
and we will never send military forces to suppress americans exercising their constitutional rights

and the consequences of america s disengagement from the world

we support the development of a vaccine accelerator to ensure rapid equitable and affordable global access to vaccines therapeutics and supplies

and mobilize a united front to keep states like china from outsourcing pollution to other countries 
democrats believe that executing a strategy of bold climate leadership will require sustained focus and increased expertise across our foreign policy institutions

and we will ensure that america s service missions abroad including those executed through the peace corps and usaid expand their calls to action to include reducing carbon pollution 
safeguarding indigenous peoples and vulnerable populations from climate impacts 
democrats believe that american diplomatic leadership is critical to maximizing the benefits of technological innovation while minimizing its risks and dislocations 
we have a stake in bridging the gap between the pace of innovation and the development of rules of the road governing the most consequential domains of technology from cyberspace to artificial intelligence to synthetic biology 
and prosperity to be shared broadly

democrats will partner with other countries and private companies to build up capacity 
and implement appropriate safety standards for any work that involves dangerous pathogens 
and we remain staunchly committed to the international prohibition on the development or use of biological weapons 
democrats believe the united states has a moral responsibility and national security imperative to prevent the spread of nuclear chemical and biological weapons 
and eventually secure their elimination 
over the past four years the trump administration has done precisely the opposite 
its brash nuclear threats 
ill considered withdrawals from critical arms control treaties and nuclear agreements 
and reckless embrace of a new arms race have made the united states and the world less safe 
thanks to president trump s abdication of leadership the nuclear dangers that americans face are greater than they have been in decades 
democrats reject a return to an old era of grave nuclear dangers 
democrats believe that the sole purpose of our nuclear arsenal should be to deter and if necessary retaliate against a nuclear attack 
and we will work to put that belief into practice in consultation with our allies and military 
we will work to maintain a strong credible deterrent 
while reducing our overreliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons 
the trump administration s proposal to build new nuclear weapons is unnecessary wasteful and indefensible 
democrats commit to strengthening the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons 
maintaining the moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing 
pushing for the ratification of the un arms trade treaty and comprehensive test ban treaty 
and extending new start 
just as was the case during the height of the cold war it s in our interest to work with russia to verifiably limit and reduce our nuclear stockpiles 
we will build on this foundation to negotiate arms control agreements that reflect the emergence of new players like china 
capture new technologies 
and move the world back from the nuclear precipice

enhance transparency oversight and accountability in counterterrorism programs and operations 
democrats will make gender equality a key foreign policy priority 
and work to achieve gender parity across our national security team 
we will implement the women peace and security act because advancing gender equality enhances stability and economic prosperity around the world 
along with our diplomatic partners we will incorporate more women into peace processes 
where their participation can improve the odds of a peace agreement holding 
and ensure women s leadership in peace and security processes globally 
and we will work to ratify the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women 
we will push for greater participation by women in the global workforce which studies show can boost global gdp by percent 
democrats will always protect sexual and reproductive health and rights

and we will encourage partner countries and international organizations to address the needs of persons with disabilities 
we will never use protection of that right as a cover for discrimination

democrats will fight for every american job 
and will make sure american workers have a fair shot in the global economy 
for too long the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to american workers 
too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs 
and too many countries have reneged on commitments to be honest and transparent partners 
we will not negotiate any new trade deals before first investing in american competitiveness at home 
we will aggressively enforce existing trade laws and agreements 
and we will insist on strong and enforceable standards for labor

disclosure of beneficial ownership 
and greater oversight of cross border transactions

and we will deploy the full range of america s diplomatic and economic tools to target kleptocrats including targeted sanctions and visa bans 
when used strategically as one of the tools employed alongside our allies to achieve clear policy objectives financial and economic sanctions are an effective way to advance many core u s national security objectives 
but when misused and overused sanctions not only undermine our interests 
they threaten one of the united states greatest strategic assets the importance of the american financial system 
democrats will guard against the improper application of economic and financial sanctions that incentivize foreign businesses to bypass our financial system 
corrode the power and potential of sanctions 
undercut the potential of our diplomacy 
hurt our economy 
democrats will revitalize our partnerships across africa 
to unleash enormous potential for growth and innovation 
and address together challenges and stresses across the continent

and nigeria is projected to have the third largest population in the world

and harmed the cuban people and their families in the united states

leading with pragmatic diplomacy to lay the groundwork for a more peaceful stable and free region 
democrats will call off the trump administration s race to war with iran 
and prioritize nuclear diplomacy de escalation and regional dialogue 
we believe the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa remains the best means to verifiably cut off all of iran s pathways to a nuclear bomb 
the trump administration s unilateral withdrawal from the jcpoa isolated us from our allies 
and opened the door for iran to resume its march toward a nuclear weapons capacity that the jcpoa had stopped
