we were in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the great depression 
the previous administration had put two wars on our nation s credit card 
and the american dream had slipped out of reach for too many 
today our economy is growing again 
al qaeda is weaker than at any point since 
and our manufacturing sector is growing for the first time in more than a decade 
we gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on earth 
the simple principle that in america hard work should pay off 
responsibility should be rewarded 
and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us 
we democrats offer america the opportunity to move our country forward by creating an economy built to last and built from the middle out 
mitt romney and the republican party have a drastically different vision 
they still believe the best way to grow the economy is from the top down 
the same approach that benefited the wealthy few but crashed the economy and crushed the middle class 
democrats see a young country continually made stronger by the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity in the world 
and a nation of people drawn to our shores from every corner of the globe 
we believe america can succeed because the american people have never failed 
and there is nothing that together we can not accomplish 
reclaiming the economic security of the middle class is the challenge we must overcome today 
that begins by restoring the basic values that made our country great 
and restoring for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules the opportunity to find a job that pays the bills turn an idea into a profitable business care for your family afford a home you call your own and health care you can count on retire with dignity and respect 
and most of all give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger and go even further than you ever imagined 
this has to be our north star an economy that s built not from the top down but from a growing middle class 
and that provides ladders of opportunity for those working hard to join the middle class 
it s the defining issue of our time and at the core of the american dream 
the republican party has turned its back on the middle class americans who built this country 
our opponents believe we should go back to the top down economic policies of the last decade 
they think that if we simply eliminate protections for families and consumers let wall street write its own rules again and cut taxes for the wealthiest the market will solve all our problems on its own 
they argue that if we help corporations and wealthy investors maximize their profits by whatever means necessary whether through layoffs or outsourcing it will automatically translate into jobs and prosperity that benefits us all 
they would repeal health reform 
and follow the same path of fiscal irresponsibility of the past administration giving trillions of dollars in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires while sticking the middle class with the bill 
but we ve tried their policies and we ve all suffered when they failed 
it is not enough to go back to where the country was before the crisis 
we must rebuild a strong foundation that ensures it never happens again 
democrats know that america prospers when we re all in it together 
we see an america where everyone has a fair shot does their fair share and plays by the same rules 
we see an america that out educates out builds and out innovates the rest of the world 
we see an america with greater economic security and opportunity driven by education energy innovation and infrastructure and a tax code that helps to create american jobs 
and bring down the debt in a balanced way 
we believe in deficit reduction not by placing the burden on the middle class and the poor but by cutting out programs we can t afford 
and asking the wealthiest to again contribute their fair share 
these values are why we enacted historic health care reform that provides economic security for families 
and enacted sweeping financial reform legislation that will prevent the recklessness that cost so many their jobs homes and savings 
they re why we rescued the auto industry 
and revived our manufacturing supply chain 
they re why we helped american families who are working multiple jobs and struggling to pay the bills save a little extra money through tax cuts lower health care costs and affordable student loans 
they re why we fought to reclaim the value of treating all americans with dignity and respect 
and they re why president barack obama has ended one war and is responsibly drawing down another 
they re why we re restoring our alliances and image around the world 
and pursuing a foreign policy that s making us safer 
we knew that renewing the american dream wouldn t be easy we knew it would take more than one year or one term or even one president 
we are the party of inclusion and respect differences of perspective and belief 
and so even when we disagree we work together to move this country forward 
but what is holding our nation back is a stalemate in washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction america should take 
we must keep moving forward and doing the hard work of rebuilding a strong economy 
by betting on the american worker 
and investing in a growing middle class 
we need a government that stands up for the hopes values and interests of working people 
and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their god given potential 
we ve come a long way since 
the president took office in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the great depression that month americans lost their jobs more than in any single month in the previous years 
on day one he took immediate action to stop the free fall and put americans back to work in the midst of the crisis 
president obama knew what democrats have always known that american workers are tougher than tough times 
since early the private sector has created million jobs 
and american manufacturing is growing for the first time since the s 
the president knew from the start that to rebuild true middle class security we can t just cut our way to prosperity 
we need an economy that creates the jobs of the future and makes things the rest of the world buys 
not one built on outsourcing loopholes or risky financial deals that jeopardize everyone especially the middle class 
we ve already made historic progress 
states have more flexibility to raise standards and reform schools 
more students are receiving grants and scholarships 
and young adults can stay on their parents health insurance plans as they finish their education and enter the workforce 
more working families than ever before have received tax cuts 
and fuel efficiency standards are doubling 
the president cracked down on wall street recklessness 
and abuses by health insurance credit card and mortgage companies 
a crisis this deep didn t happen overnight and it won t be solved overnight 
too many parents sit around their kitchen tables at night after they ve put their kids to bed worrying about how they will make a mortgage payment or pay the rent or how they will put their children through college 
we now stand at a make or break moment for families 
and america faces a clear choice in this election move forward toward a nation built from the middle class out where everyone has the chance to get ahead 
or go back to the same failed ideas that created the crisis in the first place 
the republicans in congress and mitt romney have a very different idea about where they want to take this country 
to pay for their trillions in additional tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires they ll raise taxes on the middle class 
and gut our investments in education research and technology and new roads bridges and airports 
they ll end medicare as we know it 
they want to let wall street write its own rules again 
and allow insurance companies to once again deny health care to working families 
their troubling and familiar economic scheme doubles down on the same bad ideas of the last decade while arguing that somehow this time they ll lead to a different result 
we have to move forward 
when president obama took office the economy was in the deepest economic crisis since the great depression 
his recovery act represented the largest education investment since president johnson 
the largest infrastructure investment since president eisenhower 
the single largest clean energy investment ever 
and the broadest tax cut in american history 
it helped keep teachers police officers nurses and firefighters on the job 
it ensured that as we re built our country we bought american made iron steel and manufactured goods wherever feasible consistent with our international obligations 
it helped the president stop the bleeding and reverse the free fall 
but just as the recession was not created overnight we knew it would take time to recover from the crisis and more needs to be done 
last september president obama put forward the american jobs act to provide an immediate boost to the economy and strengthen the recovery 
we have already enacted key parts of the american jobs act payroll tax relief tax credits for businesses that hire veterans 
and an extension of unemployment insurance that also included reforms like work sharing 
a bridge to work to help the long term unemployed reconnect with the labor force 
and support for unemployed workers looking to become entrepreneurs 
but republicans in congress blocked other provisions that independent analysis said could create one million jobs 
even as president obama remains committed to working with both parties he and his cabinet pursued a series of executive actions to help spark economic growth and job creation 
including expanding access to refinancing for families who have stayed current on their mortgages 
challenging community health centers to hire veterans 
accelerating permitting for transportation projects 
cutting waste and reducing improper payments 
and enabling student loan borrowers to cap their payments at a percentage of income 
that s why president obama and the democratic party have cut taxes on american workers and businesses 
and made sweeping reforms to the unemployment system to help get people back to work 
and we continue to fight for measures that would strengthen the recovery and create jobs now 
including keeping teachers and first responders on the job putting construction workers back to work by investing in our roads bridges schools and water supply helping families refinance their mortgages and save hundreds of dollars a month cutting taxes for small businesses that invest and hire and putting veterans back to work 
that s why we continue to fight for relief for the long term unemployed 
including a ban on hiring discrimination against the unemployed 
and a reformed and expanded universal worker training proposal to provide more training and job search assistance to all displaced workers regardless of how they lost their job 
the president s plan includes many measures that have long had bipartisan support 
middle class tax cuts president obama and democrats in congress cut taxes for every working family putting more money in the pockets of americans who need it most 
a typical family has saved during his first term 
now he s fighting to stop middle class families and those aspiring to join the middle class from seeing their taxes go up 
and to extend key tax relief for working families and those paying for college 
while asking the wealthiest and corporations to pay their fair share 
that is why we will always vigorously oppose the type of tax reform supported by mitt romney which independent experts have found would require raising taxes on typical families with children by at least if it were paid for 
at the same time mitt romney s plan would cut taxes for those making over million by an average of 
and would create incentives that will lead to hundreds of thousands of jobs going overseas at the expense of american workers 
health care we believe accessible affordable high quality health care is part of the american promise 
that americans should have the security that comes with good health care 
and that no one should go broke because they get sick 
over the determined opposition of republicans we enacted landmark reforms that are already helping millions of americans and more benefits will come soon 
as a result of our efforts today young americans entering the workforce can stay on their parents plans 
insurers can no longer refuse to cover kids with pre existing medical conditions 
insurance companies will no longer be able to arbitrarily cap and cancel coverage 
or charge women more simply because of their gender 
people with private insurance are getting preventive services like cancer screenings annual well woman visits and fda approved contraception with no out of pocket costs 
we ve established new offices of minority health 
and are helping state medicaid programs fund home and community based services 
small businesses are receiving tax credits to help them cover their workers 
and businesses and families are receiving rebates from insurers who overcharged them 
soon working families will finally have the security of knowing they won t lose health care or be forced into bankruptcy if a family member gets sick or loses their job 
and soon insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre existing conditions 
medicaid will cover more working families 
those who don t get insurance at work will be able to shop in new exchanges and will be eligible for new tax credits 
as a result all americans will have access to health care 
mitt romney and the republican party would repeal health reform 
they are more concerned with playing politics than supporting families in this country 
no law is perfect and democrats stand willing to work with anyone to improve the law where necessary but we are committed to moving forward 
we will continue to stand up to republicans working to take away the benefits and protections that are already helping millions of americans every day 
we refuse to go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your health policy deny you coverage or charge women more than men 
at the same time the affordable care act is not the end of efforts to improve health care for all americans 
democrats will continue to fight for a strong health care workforce with an emphasis on primary care 
we remain committed to eliminating disparities in health 
and will continue to make sure families have access to mental health and substance abuse services 
we will strengthen medicaid 
and oppose efforts to block grant the program slash its funding and leave millions more without health insurance 
we will continue to invest in our public health infrastructure ensuring that we are able to respond to emergencies and support community based efforts to prevent disease 
the recovery act and the health reform law made historic investments in community health centers 
and democrats will continue to support these valuable institutions 
we democrats have increased overall funding to combat hiv aids to record levels and will continue our nation s fight against hiv aids 
president obama established the first ever comprehensive national hiv aids strategy for responding to the domestic epidemic 
which calls for reducing hiv incidence increasing access to care optimizing health outcomes and reducing hiv related health disparities 
this is an evidence based plan that is guided by science and seeks to direct resources to the communities at greatest risk including gay men black and latino americans substance users and others at high risk of infection 
and we will continue to support america s groundbreaking biomedical researchers in their lifesaving work 
stabilizing the housing market and hard hit communities for more than a decade irresponsible lenders tricked buyers into signing subprime loans while too many homeowners got in over their heads by buying homes they couldn t afford 
but when the housing bubble burst it hurt everyone including responsible homeowners who played by the rules but saw their home values decline and their neighbors houses sit vacant 
the housing market s dramatic collapse did more than punish millions of innocent americans it also triggered the economy s downward spiral into recession 
president obama took swift action to stabilize a housing market in crisis 
helping five million families restructure their loans to help them stay in their homes 
making it easier for families to refinance their mortgages and save hundreds of dollars a month 
and giving tax credits to first time home buyers 
he also cracked down on fraudulent mortgage lenders and other abuses that contributed to the housing crisis 
democrats have held the largest financial institutions accountable by requiring them to provide relief for homeowners still struggling to pay their mortgages 
and to change practices that took advantage of homeowners 
democrats also understand the importance of helping communities fight back against the foreclosures that threaten entire neighborhoods 
which is why the president proposed to expand the successful neighborhood stabilization efforts in his american jobs act 
too many people still owe more on their homes than they are worth 
that is why democrats are fighting to give every responsible homeowner the chance to refinance their home spurring investment in communities that have been hit hardest by foreclosure and taking whatever steps we can to avoid more foreclosures 
the president remains committed to creating an economy that s built to last 
where home ownership is an achievable dream for all americans 
social security and medicare we believe every american deserves a secure healthy and dignified retirement 
america s seniors have earned their medicare and social security through a lifetime of hard work and personal responsibility 
president obama is committed to preserving that promise for this and future generations 
during their working years americans contribute to social security in exchange for a promise that they will receive an income in retirement 
unlike those in the other party we will find a solution to protect social security for future generations 
we will block republican efforts to subject americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market through privatization 
we reject approaches that insist that cutting benefits is the only answer 
president obama will also make it easier for americans to save on their own for retirement and prepare for unforeseen expenses by participating in retirement accounts at work 
the republican budget plan would end medicare as we know it 
democrats adamantly oppose any efforts to privatize or voucherize medicare 
unlike our opponents we will not ask seniors to pay thousands of dollars more every year while they watch the value of their medicare benefits evaporate 
democrats believe that medicare is a sacred compact with our seniors 
nearly million older americans and americans with disabilities rely on medicare each year and the new health care law makes medicare stronger by adding new benefits 
fighting fraud 
and improving care for patients 
and over years the law will save the average medicare beneficiary 
president obama is already leading the most successful crackdown on health care fraud ever having already recovered billion from health care scams 
we will build on those reforms not eliminate medicare s guarantees 
the health care law is closing the gap in prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole 
more than five million seniors have already saved money an average of last year and the doughnut hole will be closed for good by 
in short democrats believe that social security and medicare must be kept strong for seniors people with disabilities and future generations 
our opponents have shown a shocking willingness to gut these programs to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and we fundamentally reject that approach 
an economy that out educates the world and offers greater access to higher education and technical training democrats believe that getting an education is the surest path to the middle class 
giving all students the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and contribute to our economy and democracy 
public education is one of our critical democratic institutions 
we are committed to ensuring that every child in america has access to a world class public education so we can out educate the world and make sure america has the world s highest proportion of college graduates by 
this requires excellence at every level of our education system from early learning through post secondary education 
it means we must close the achievement gap in america s schools 
and ensure that in every neighborhood in the country children can benefit from high quality educational opportunities 
this is why we have helped states and territories develop comprehensive plans to raise standards and improve instruction in their early learning programs 
and invested in expanding and reforming head start 
president obama and the democrats are committed to working with states and communities so they have the flexibility and resources they need to improve elementary and secondary education in a way that works best for students 
to that end the president challenged and encouraged states to raise their standards so students graduate ready for college or career and can succeed in a dynamic global economy 
forty six states responded leading groundbreaking reforms that will deliver better education to millions of american students 
too many students particularly students of color and disadvantaged students drop out of our schools and democrats know we must address the dropout crisis with the urgency it deserves 
the democratic party understands the importance of turning around struggling public schools 
we will continue to strengthen all our schools 
and work to expand public school options for low income youth including magnet schools charter schools teacher led schools and career academies 
because there is no substitute for a great teacher at the head of a classroom the president helped school districts save more than educator jobs 
we democrats honor our nation s teachers who do a heroic job for their students every day 
if we want high quality education for all our kids we must listen to the people who are on the front lines 
the president has laid out a plan to prevent more teacher layoffs while attracting and rewarding great teachers 
this includes raising standards for the programs that prepare our teachers recognizing and rewarding good teaching and retaining good teachers 
we also believe in carefully crafted evaluation systems that give struggling teachers a chance to succeed 
and protect due process if another teacher has to be put in the classroom 
we also recognize there is no substitute for a parent s involvement in their child s education 
to help keep college within reach for every student democrats took on banks to reform our student loan program saving more than billion by removing the banks acting as middlemen so we can better and more directly invest in students 
to make college affordable for students of all backgrounds and confront the loan burden our students shoulder we doubled our investment in pell grant scholarships and created the american opportunity tax credit worth up to over four years of college 
and we re creating avenues for students to manage their federal student loans so that their payments can be only percent of what they make each month 
president obama has pledged to encourage colleges to keep their costs down by reducing federal aid for those that do not 
investing in colleges that keep tuition affordable and provide good value 
doubling the number of work study jobs available to students 
and continuing to ensure that students have access to federal loans with reasonable interest rates 
we invested more than billion in savings from reforming our student loan system to strengthen our nation s historically black colleges and universities hispanic serving institutions tribal colleges and universities alaska hawaiian native institutions asian american and pacific islander institutions and other minority serving institutions 
these schools play an important role in creating a diverse workforce 
educating new teachers 
and producing the next generation of stem workers 
we democrats also recognize the economic opportunities created by our nation s community colleges 
that is why the president has invested in community colleges and called for additional partnerships between businesses and community colleges to train two million workers with the skills they need for good jobs waiting to be filled 
and to support business labor apprenticeship programs that provide skills and opportunity to thousands of americans 
the president also proposed to double key investments in science to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers 
encourage private sector innovation 
and prepare at least math and science teachers over the next decade 
and to make this country a destination for global talent and ingenuity we won t deport deserving young people who are americans in every way but on paper 
and we will work to make it possible for foreign students earning advanced degrees in science technology engineering and mathematics to stay and help create jobs here at home 
mitt romney has a radically different vision 
he says we need fewer teachers cops and firefighters good middle class jobs even after losing hundreds of thousands of such jobs during the recession and at a time when state local and territorial governments are still shedding these jobs 
he supports dramatic cuts to head start and the pell grant program 
tuition at public colleges has soared over the last decade and students are graduating with more and more debt 
but mitt romney thinks students should shop around for the best education they can afford 
and he supports the radical house republican budget that would cut financial aid for more than one million students while giving tax cuts to the rich 
we democrats have focused on making sure that taxpayer dollars support high quality education programs 
but mitt romney is a staunch supporter of expensive for profit schools schools that often leave students buried in debt and without the skills for quality jobs and that prey on our servicemembers and veterans 
after the previous administration put two wars and tax cuts weighted towards the wealthy on the nation s credit card 
and in the wake of the worst recession since the great depression 
democrats took decisive steps to restore fiscal responsibility to washington 
we reinstated the tough pay as you go budget rules of the s so that all permanent new spending and tax cuts must now be offset by savings or revenue increases 
president obama has already signed into law trillion in spending reductions as part of a balanced plan to reduce our deficits by over trillion over the next decade 
while taking immediate steps to strengthen the economy now 
this approach includes tough spending cuts that will bring annual domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in years 
while still allowing us to make investments that benefit the middle class now 
and reduce our deficit over a decade 
we are committed to defeating efforts that would return us to the failed economic policies of the past in which tax relief for the wealthy explodes the deficit and asks the middle class to shoulder that burden 
to help spur economic growth president obama and the democratic party cut taxes for every working family providing in tax relief to the typical family over the president s first term in office 
and we are committed to extending the middle class tax cuts for the percent of american families who make less than a year 
and we will not raise taxes on them 
the republican party has a different vision instead of asking everyone to do their fair share and making investments we need for an economy built to last they would slash taxes for corporations and the wealthiest americans 
let wall street once again write its own rules 
and balance the budget on the backs of the middle class 
romney and congressional republicans share the same distorted view of the economy and support the same lopsided budget 
romney would roll back the tax relief democrats provided to working families and college students and would require massive new taxes on the middle class to pay for his trillion tax plan that primarily benefits the wealthy 
the democratic party opposes efforts to give additional tax cuts to the wealthiest americans at the expense of the middle class and investments in our future 
all of the above energy policy in the last four years president obama and the democratic party have taken concrete steps to make us more energy independent 
we ve supported nearly clean energy jobs 
and americans are importing less oil breathing cleaner air and saving money on energy costs 
historic investments in clean energy technologies have helped double the electricity we get from wind and solar 
new emissions and fuel efficiency standards for american cars are reducing our oil use 
saving consumers at the pump 
and putting americans back to work 
our dependence on foreign oil is now at a year low and a new era of cheap abundant natural gas is helping to bring jobs and industry back to the united states 
we can move towards a sustainable energy independent future if we harness all of america s great natural resources 
that means an all of the above approach to developing america s many energy resources including wind solar biofuels geothermal hydropower nuclear oil clean coal and natural gas 
president obama has encouraged innovation to reach his goal of generating percent of our electricity from clean energy sources by 
democrats support making america the world s leader in building a clean energy economy by extending clean energy incentives that support american businesses and american jobs in communities across the country 
it s not enough to invent clean energy technologies here we want to make them here and sell them around the world 
we can further cut our reliance on oil with increased energy efficiency in buildings industry and homes 
and through the promotion of advanced vehicles fuel economy standards and the greater use of natural gas in transportation 
harnessing our natural gas resources needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner 
which is why the obama administration has proposed a number of safeguards to protect against water contamination and air pollution 
we will continue to advocate for the use of this clean fossil fuel 
while ensuring that public and environmental health and workers safety are protected 
we support more infrastructure investment to speed the transition to cleaner fuels in the transportation sector 
and we are expediting the approval process to build out critical oil and gas lines essential to transporting our energy for consumers 
building a clean energy future means that new exploration and production needs to be approached safely and responsibly 
democrats are committed to balancing environmental protection with development 
and that means preserving sensitive public lands from exploration like the arctic national wildlife refuge pacific west coast gulf of maine and other irreplaceable national landscapes 
we are saving consumers money on their energy bills both at home and at the pump 
but republican energy policy is full of empty rhetoric and bad ideas that would make their big oil donors even richer at the expense of the middle class 
republicans would keep giving billions of taxpayer dollars a year to profitable oil companies and increase costs on consumers 
democrats will fight to cut tax subsidies for big oil while promoting job growth in the clean energy sector 
so we can cut the deficit and increase jobs and growth in america 
they can vote for republicans who opposed saving the auto industry 
who favor a tax code that would actually encourage outsourcing and 
whose plans would gut investments in federally financed labs and universities that build new american industries 
or they can elect democrats who bet on the american worker 
will reward those who create private sector jobs here in america 
and make the investments that strengthen the middle class 
betting on american manufacturing and the american automobile industry thanks to president obama s recovery program american manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the s including more than jobs since the beginning of 
instead of cutting jobs or shipping them abroad many american companies are now insourcing or bringing overseas jobs back home 
president obama and the democrats boldly rescued america s auto industry 
saving more than one million jobs 
preventing the collapse of the industry s supply chain 
and shoring up countless communities while revitalizing the backbone of america s manufacturing sector 
mitt romney thought the government s action would destroy the auto industry 
he and republican leaders opposed the support president obama extended to rescue an iconic industry 
all three of america s biggest auto manufacturers chrysler gm and ford are stronger today because of president obama s decisive leadership 
gm and chrysler have repaid their outstanding loans years ahead of schedule 
new american cars are inspiring pride 
and the auto industry added more than jobs in the last three years 
at the same time president obama forged an agreement with american carmakers to nearly double fuel efficiency standards in the coming years changes that will save a typical car owner more than in fuel costs over the life of their vehicle and reduce american consumers fuel costs by almost trillion 
today american carmakers and auto workers are helping to drive a stronger recovery 
the democratic party supports a broad based strategy to further strengthen an american renaissance in manufacturing 
with tax relief for clean energy manufacturing 
incentives to create advanced vehicles in the united states 
more research and a network of manufacturing innovation hubs 
insourcing the democratic party believes in insourcing so that america can out build the rest of the world again 
we want to cut tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and for special interests 
and instead offer tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the united states of america 
betting on american workers who are making american products we sell to the world that are stamped with three proud words made in america 
after decades of watching american companies take jobs to other countries we re beginning to see entrepreneurs and manufactures make the decision to keep factories and production facilities here in the united states 
and even bring jobs back from overseas 
but the republican party has nominated a man whose firm invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing 
and whose plans would actually encourage outsourcing by eliminating all taxes on the foreign profits of u s companies 
we democrats support lowering the corporate tax rate while closing unnecessary loopholes 
and lowering rates even further for manufacturers who create good jobs at home 
we will give our businesses access to newer roads and airports and faster railroads and internet access 
we will fight for immediate investments for highways transit rail and aviation and for the creation of a national infrastructure bank to help modernize our infrastructure 
put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job 
and help businesses grow 
out building the rest of the world we support long term investments in our infrastructure 
roads bridges rail and public transit systems airports ports and sewers are all critical to economic growth as they enable businesses to grow 
that s why president obama and democrats in congress have enacted infrastructure investments that will 
sustain our highway trust fund 
and provide states u s territories and communities with two years of funding to build needed infrastructure 
these investments are critical for putting americans back to work 
and strengthening america s transportation system to grow our economy 
the president has proposed to go substantially further including a significant up front investment in our infrastructure 
followed by sustained increases in investment 
paid for with part of the savings from winding down our overseas wars 
together with reforms that will better leverage government dollars and target significant projects 
we will continue to partner with local communities to support their sustainable development 
out innovating the rest of the world democrats support a world class commitment to science and research so that the next generation of innovators and high technology manufacturing companies thrive in america 
president obama signed into law changes to help entrepreneurs raise capital and create jobs 
democrats are committed to preparing math and science teachers 
and training workers with skills for the future 
and doubling funding for key basic research agencies 
we support expanding and making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit 
president obama has charted a new mission for nasa to lead us to a future that builds on america s legacy of innovation and exploration 
democrats reformed the patent system to speed approval of investors patents and provide alternatives to wasteful litigation 
democrats know that the united states must preserve our leadership in the internet economy 
we will ensure that america has a st century digital infrastructure robust wired and wireless broadband capability a smarter electrical grid and upgraded information technology infrastructure in key sectors such as health care and education 
president obama has committed to ensuring that percent of the country has access to high speed wireless broadband internet access 
we are finding innovative ways to free up wireless spectrum 
and are building a state of the art nationwide interoperable public safety network 
president obama is strongly committed to protecting an open internet that fosters investment innovation creativity consumer choice and free speech unfettered by censorship or undue violations of privacy 
the administration is vigorously protecting u s intellectual property our technology and creativity at home and abroad through better enforcement and innovative approaches such as voluntary efforts by all parties to minimize infringement 
while supporting the free flow of information 
customs seizures of counterfeit drugs are up percent and seizures of fake consumer safety and critical technology have increased nearly percent 
the department of justice has aggressively prosecuted the illegal overseas transfer of trade secrets 
as technology advances we will continue to work with all stakeholders to protect the security of the nation and its knowledge assets u s intellectual property the functioning of fair and competitive markets and the privacy free expression and due process rights of americans 
standing up for workers when the president took office the american middle class was under assault 
from to we had the slowest private sector job growth in an economic expansion since world war ii 
the typical family saw its income stall and inequality climb even as the economy grew 
and we had an administration that thought the answer was limiting unions 
upon taking office president obama began the work of restoring an economy built to last that creates good jobs that pay well 
because the president and the democratic party believe in the right to organize and in supporting america s workers with strong labor laws the president rolled back harmful labor policies designed to undermine collective bargaining rights 
the president appointed members of the national labor relations board and national mediation board who understand the importance of standing up for the rights of workers 
he placed his bet on the american worker when he rescued the auto industry 
his administration will continue its fight against the exploitative practice of employers fraudulently misclassifying workers as independent contractors or white collar workers to evade taxes or deny them protections and overtime benefits 
as new employment relationships evolve away from the traditional employee employer model we need to make sure our labor laws are modernized and keep pace with changes in our economy 
the republican party would return us to the failed policies of the last administration vilifying the american worker undermining unions and arguing that everyone should fend for themselves 
we oppose the attacks on collective bargaining that republican governors and state legislatures are mounting in states around the country 
democrats believe that the right to organize and collectively bargain is a fundamental american value 
every american should have a voice on the job and 
a chance to negotiate for a fair day s pay after a hard day s work 
we will continue to fight for the right of all workers to organize and join a union 
unions helped build the greatest middle class the world has ever known 
their work resulted in the hour workweek and weekends paid leave and pensions the minimum wage and health insurance and social security and medicare the cornerstones of middle class security 
we will fight for labor laws that provide a fair process for workers to choose union representation that facilitate the collective bargaining process 
and that strengthen remedies for violations of the law 
we will fight for collective bargaining rights for police officers nurses firefighters emergency medical technicians teachers and other public sector workers jobs that are a proven path to the middle class for millions of americans 
we will continue to vigorously oppose right to work and paycheck protection efforts and so called save our secret ballot measures whenever they are proposed 
we will raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation 
we believe in an america where people looking for work can find good jobs 
where hard work pays 
and where responsibility is rewarded 
our occupational safety and health administration will continue to adopt and enforce comprehensive safety standards 
the first bill the president signed was the lilly ledbetter fair pay act we are committed to passing the paycheck fairness act and we will continue to battle republican opposition to efforts to stop wage discrimination 
helping small business small businesses employ half of all working americans and over the last two decades have created two out of three net new jobs 
democrats believe that small businesses are the engine of job growth in america 
president obama signed small business tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire more workers 
and make job creating investments in machinery and equipment and proposed significant additional small business tax relief 
he encouraged investment and supported start ups by allowing businesses to write off the full cost of new equipment and machinery they bought in 
altogether the president s small business jobs act accelerated billion in tax relief through 
democrats made it easier for small businesses to access the loans they needed to grow and hire 
the president signed into law changes to help entrepreneurs raise capital while maintaining key investor protections 
small businesses are now once again creating jobs 
democrats have helped small businesses provide health insurance to their workers with a tax credit to help pay for the cost of coverage 
in the tax credit will grow and small businesses will be able to pool their purchasing power together to get affordable coverage 
we recognize the importance of small business to women people of color tribes and rural america 
and will work to help nurture entrepreneurship 
president obama and the democratic party are committed to continue cutting red tape for small businesses 
helping them sell their goods around the world 
and access the capital they need to grow 
this includes tax cuts for small businesses that make new investments hire more workers or increase wages 
opened markets all over the world for american products president obama and the democratic party know that america has the best workers and businesses in the world 
if the playing field is level americans will be able to compete against every other country on earth 
over the last four years we have made historic progress toward the goal of doubling our exports by 
we have taken steps to open new markets to american products 
while ensuring that other countries play by the same rules 
president obama signed into law new trade agreements with south korea colombia and panama that will support tens of thousands of private sector jobs 
but not before he strengthened these agreements on behalf of american workers and businesses 
we remain committed to finding more markets for american made goods 
including using the trans pacific partnership between the united states and eight countries in the asia pacific one of the most dynamic regions in the world 
while ensuring that workers rights and environmental standards are upheld 
and fighting against unfair trade practices 
we expanded and reformed assistance for trade affected workers 
and we demanded renewal of that help alongside new trade agreements 
both publicly and privately the president has made clear to the chinese government that it needs to take steps to appreciate its currency so that america is competing on a level playing field 
this administration has doubled the rate of trade cases brought against china by the last administration 
and created a new government wide interagency trade enforcement center 
the president is committed to continuing to fight unfair trade practices that disadvantage american producers and workers including illegal subsidies non tariff barriers and abuse of worker rights or environmental standards 
for too long we ve had a financial system that stacked the deck against ordinary americans 
banks on wall street played by different rules than businesses on main street and community banks 
without strong enough regulations families were enticed and sometimes tricked into buying homes they couldn t afford 
banks and investors were allowed to package and sell risky mortgages 
huge reckless bets were made with other people s money on the line 
that behavior not only nearly destroyed the financial system 
it cost our economy millions of jobs 
hurt middle class and poor families 
and left taxpayers holding the bill 
for the past three and a half years president obama and democrats around the country have been fighting to bring the country back from this historic economic crisis 
we put in place wall street reform with smarter tougher commonsense rules that will prevent a crisis like that from ever happening again 
we know that the free market only works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair open and honest 
mitt romney and the republicans would roll back financial reform 
and let wall street write its own rules again 
the president put in place government reform that has led to the most open efficient and accountable government in history 
we know that transparent and effective government makes economic sense 
republicans would continue to allow lobbyists too much sway over lawmakers 
leading to gridlock in washington 
an outdated regulatory system 
and a tax code riddled with loopholes 
the president put in place unprecedented ethics reforms 
and we re fighting for campaign finance reform 
we know that millions of americans are struggling to get by and their voices shouldn t be drowned out by millions of dollars in secret special interest lobbying and advertising 
mitt romney s opposition to commonsense campaign finance is nothing less than support for corporate and special interest takeovers in our elections 
we believe america prospers when everyone from main street to wall street does their fair share and plays by the same rules 
we will not back down from making sure an oil company can t take the same reckless actions that led to the kind of oil spill we saw in the gulf of mexico two years ago 
we will not back down from protecting our kids from toxic mercury pollution 
or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean 
we will not back down from ensuring that everyone has a seat at the american table and the opportunity to grab the first rung on the ladder to the middle class 
a strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules from wall street to main street 
that s why president obama and democrats in congress overcame fierce opposition from the financial industry to pass the most far reaching wall street reform in generations 
the failed policies of the past decade and hands off approach toward the excesses of the financial industry helped create the deepest economic catastrophe since the great depression 
in the fall of when the financial system and economy were on the verge of catastrophic collapse the last administration put in place the troubled asset relief program 
the obama administration has ensured that big banks repay these loans with interest 
and its rigorous stewardship has brought transparency and accountability to the program 
we enacted wall street reform to end all future taxpayer funded bank bailouts 
today democrats are holding wall street accountable 
bringing new transparency to financial markets 
and ending taxpayer funded bank bailouts and the era of too big to fail 
president obama put in place new rules of the road that refocus the financial sector on getting capital to entrepreneurs 
and small and mid sized businesses who create jobs and financing to millions of families who want to buy a home or send their kids to college 
we ve created a single consumer watchdog agency whose sole job is looking out for working families by protecting them from deceptive and unfair lending practices of mortgage brokers payday lenders debt collectors and other financial institutions 
democrats are not only fighting to protect consumers from practices that can hurt their pocketbooks and add to their debt but also working to put an end to practices that helped cause the mortgage crisis 
mitt romney and his allies in congress believe that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down 
the same approach that benefited a few but crashed the economy hurt the middle class and contributed to soaring income inequality 
they would roll back financial reform and let wall street write its own rules again 
president obama and the democrats are committed to rethinking reforming and remaking our government so that it can meet the challenges of our time 
we reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety 
we reject the argument that says for the economy to grow we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies 
or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury 
or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients 
rules should be simpler and more flexible 
and regulations should be based on sound science and secure americans freedom of choice 
in our platform hearing we heard about the importance of a safety net that works public schools that educate and government that invests in a strong economy 
a st century regulatory system must promote economic growth innovation and job creation 
while also protecting public health and welfare 
president obama proposed a simpler smarter and more cost effective approach to regulation rather than one riddled with special rules written by lobbyists 
efficient and effective regulations enforce common sense safeguards to protect the american people 
it s why our food is safe to eat our water is safe to drink and our air is safe to breathe 
it s why we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies 
and new rules to prevent another financial crisis 
that s why the administration launched the internet privacy bill of rights 
and encouraged innovative solutions such as a do not track option for consumers 
but there s no question that some regulations are outdated unnecessary or too costly 
that s why president obama asked all federal agencies to review and streamline outdated regulations 
an effort that will save at least billion over five years 
and will eliminate tens of millions of hours in annual paperwork burdens 
that s why he has approved fewer regulations in the first three years of his presidency than his republican predecessor did in his 
at the same time those regulations have more than times the net benefits of the previous administration s regulations 
looking to make our government leaner smarter and more consumer friendly president obama has asked congress to reinstate the authority that past presidents had to reorganize and consolidate government agencies 
president obama has also called for an ambitious transparent and unprecedented government wide review of existing federal regulations to eliminate unnecessary rules 
in response more than two dozen agencies have released plans to streamline existing requirements 
just a small fraction of these initiatives will save billions of dollars in the near future without sacrificing consumer protections the environment workplace safety or health 
for too long overlapping responsibilities among agencies have made it harder rather than easier for our small businesses to interact with their government 
where appropriate we are also committed to working with states and u s territories to support innovation in exchange for accountability and results 
we are committed to the most open efficient and accountable government in history 
and we believe that government is more accountable when it is transparent 
this administration was the first to make public the list of visitors to the white house 
and create a centralized ethics and lobbying database available to the public online 
democrats led the fight to enact the stock act to ban congressional insider trading 
president obama launched the open government initiative to empower the public through greater openness and new technologies to influence the decisions that affect their lives 
we are committed to using government as a platform to spur innovation and collaboration 
forums such as data gov release more information to the public so that the private sector can pioneer innovative new services 
our political system is under assault by those who believe that special interests should be able to buy whatever they want in our society including our government 
our opponents have applauded the supreme court s decision in citizens united and welcomed the new flow of special interest money with open arms 
in stark contrast we believe we must take immediate action to curb the influence of lobbyists and special interests on our political institutions 
president obama signed an executive order to establish unprecedented ethics rules so that those who leave the executive branch may not lobby this administration and officials may not accept gifts from lobbyists 
we support campaign finance reform by constitutional amendment if necessary 
we support legislation to close loopholes and require greater disclosure of campaign spending 
president obama and the national democratic party do not accept contributions from federal lobbyists this cycle 
we support requiring groups trying to influence elections to reveal their donors so the public will know who s funding the political ads it sees 
president obama and the democrats are fighting to reduce the influence of money in politics and holding congress to higher conflict of interest standards 
as americans we are bound together by more than nationality or geography 
we are bound by a shared set of ideals and values rooted in the notion that we are greater together 
that our collective efforts produce something better than the sum of our individual actions 
and that together rather than divided we can overcome the greatest challenges that come our way 
the path to restoring middle class security is through the basic values that made our country great 
we are a nation that says anyone can make it if you try no matter who you are where you come from or what you look like 
we know that america is strongest when everybody has a seat at the table 
and when the same rules apply to everyone from main street to wall street 
republicans like mitt romney want to turn back the clock on the progress we ve made 
telling people whom they can marry 
restricting women s access to birth control coverage 
and going back to the same economic policies that benefited the wealthy but crashed our economy 
their narrow vision is of an america where everyone is left to fend for themselves 
and the powerful can write their own rules 
ours is a vision of a big compassionate america where everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead not just those already at the very top 
it s a vision that says everyone gets a fair shot 
everyone does their fair share 
and everyone engages in fair play 
it s a vision that says we prosper when we realize that we are all in it together 
and stand united as a nation without dividing or excluding people 
immigration democrats are strongly committed to enacting comprehensive immigration reform that supports our economic goals and reflects our values as both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants 
the story of the united states would not be possible without the generations of immigrants who have strengthened our country and contributed to our economy 
our prosperity depends on an immigration system that reflects our values and meets america s needs 
but americans know that today our immigration system is badly broken separating families 
undermining honest employers and workers 
and leaving millions of people working and living in the shadows 
democrats know there is broad consensus to repair that system and strengthen our economy 
and that the country urgently needs comprehensive immigration reform that brings undocumented immigrants out of the shadows 
and requires them to get right with the law learn english and pay taxes in order to get on a path to earn citizenship 
we need an immigration reform that creates a system for allocating visas that meets our economic needs 
keeps families together 
and enforces the law 
but instead of promoting the national interest republicans have blocked immigration reform in congress and used the issue as a political wedge 
despite the obstacles president obama has made important progress in implementing immigration policies that reward hard work and demand personal responsibility 
today the southwest border is more secure than at any time in the past years 
unlawful crossings are at a year low 
and the border patrol is better staffed than at any time in its history 
we are continuing to work to hold employers accountable for whom they hire 
the department of homeland security is prioritizing the deportation of criminals who endanger our communities over the deportation of immigrants who do not pose a threat such as children who came here through no fault of their own and are pursuing an education 
president obama s administration has streamlined the process of legal immigration for immediate relatives of u s citizens 
supporting family reunification as a priority 
and has enhanced opportunities for english language learning and immigrant integration 
when states sought to interfere with federal immigration law by passing local measures targeting immigrants this administration challenged them in court 
president obama and the democrats fought for the dream act legislation ensuring that young people who want to contribute fully to our society and serve our country are able to become legal residents and ultimately citizens 
although this bill has a long history of bipartisan support republicans decided to play politics with it rather than do the right thing 
so the obama administration provided temporary relief for youth who came to the united states as children through no fault of their own grew up as americans and are poised to make a real contribution to our country 
president obama and the democratic party stand for comprehensive immigration reform that intelligently prioritizes our country s security and economic needs

but we will also continue to prioritize support for wounded warriors mental health and the well being of our military families and veterans 
we will keep working to give our veterans the health care benefits education and job opportunities that they have earned

that s why the president is working to ensure returning veterans are able to get good jobs and put their skills to good use at home 
that s why the president has launched partnerships with the private sector to help veterans transfer their experience into skilled manufacturing jobs 
and why the president has proposed a new veterans jobs corps to put veterans to work as first responders 
that s why the president signed an executive order making it harder for for profit colleges to prey on veterans 
that s why we enacted the returning heroes tax credit and the wounded warrior tax credit to give companies incentives to hire vets 
that s why we have committed to ending veterans homelessness by 
and have launched new partnerships with the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development and with veterans organizations to do just that 
that s why because the traumas of war don t always end when our loved ones return home this administration is continuing to work to meet the mental health needs of our veterans 
that s why we will continue to partner with the nation s veterans service organizations and veterans advocacy groups to ensure that every veteran of every generation receives the care and benefits they ve earned 
that s why we have made it easier for veterans in rural communities to get the care they need 
and it is why we have substantially increased funding for the va 
and directed it to eliminate its backlog of claims 
hire additional claims processors 
and deploy new systems to improve claims processing times

we know that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith and the countless acts of justice and mercy it inspires 
faith based organizations will always be critical allies in meeting the challenges that face our nation and our world from domestic and global poverty to climate change and human trafficking

our vision for rural america stands in stark contrast to our opponents

they would severely weaken the farm safety net for family farmers in times of natural disaster and economic hardship 
agriculture an agricultural economy built to last is integral to the affordability of our food the independence of our energy supply and the security of america s middle class

they are more than half of this country 
and issues that affect women also affect families 
that is why the first bill he signed into law was the lilly ledbetter fair pay act which helps women fight back when they are paid less than men 
and why we continue to fight to overcome republican opposition and pass the paycheck fairness act to help stop gender discrimination in pay before it starts

preventing our local communities from sinking into deeper holes and being forced to lay off tens of thousands of police officers firefighters emergency medical technicians and teachers 
this administration is implementing the neighborhood revitalization initiative to combat poverty in american cities and the sustainable communities initiative supports the proposed growth zone initiatives and has invested in green jobs training programs community development public and affordable housing and homelessness prevention to cut red tape and help revitalize american cities 
which is why it has listened to city leaders about what they need most and is fostering ground up instead of top down solutions by assigning federal workers to work side by side with local leaders in struggling cities 
president obama and democrats in congress have enacted infrastructure investments that will sustain our highway trust fund 
and provide states u s territories and communities with two years of funding to build needed roads bridges and transit systems 
we will continue to partner with local communities to support their sustainable developments such as passenger rail bicycle and pedestrian paths and other projects to support livable cities 
poverty too many americans live without hope for a better future or access to good family supporting jobs 
fifteen percent of our fellow citizens live in poverty 
and one in five families struggles with food insecurity 
many of these families work but are unable to pay the bills 
the economic crisis has hit low income american families particularly hard but merely restoring our country to where it was before the economic crisis is not enough 
we must make ending poverty a national priority 
when the president took office we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month 
president obama and democrats took immediate action to get the economy moving again 
by expanding the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit and supporting unemployment insurance benefits and food stamps the recovery act kept seven million people out of poverty and reduced poverty for million more in 
the obama administration invested in promise neighborhoods in communities across the country 
a comprehensive approach to fighting poverty from early learning to college and career 
the administration provided grants to financial institutions in urban and rural communities for the purpose of increasing lending for low income americans 
democrats believe that we must raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation 
we will continue to fight for equal pay for equal work 
a strong labor movement 
and access to a world class education for every child 
we will help lift people with disabilities out of poverty 
we understand that poverty disproportionately affects communities of color 
and we are committed to working with those most affected by poverty 
we will continue the improvements in refundable tax credits for low income families to encourage work and education while lifting families out of poverty 
to enhance access and equity in employment education and business opportunities we encourage initiatives to remove barriers to equal opportunity that still exist in america 
we will expand the promise neighborhoods program to prepare more students for college 
we face an opposition that has proven its priorities are elsewhere 
mitt romney would raise taxes on low and middle income americans to fund his tax breaks weighted toward the wealthiest 
we reject the republican budget plan that would force us to destroy the safety net in order to help the wealthiest avoid doing their fair share 
public safety justice and crime prevention in the last four years rates of serious crimes like murder rape and robbery have reached year lows but there is more work to do 
president obama and democrats are fighting for new funding that will help keep cops on the street 
and support our police firefighters and emergency medical technicians 
republicans and mitt romney have opposed and even ridiculed these proposals but we believe we should support our first responders 
we support efforts to ensure our courageous police officers and first responders are equipped with the best technology equipment and innovative strategies to prevent and fight crimes 
we will reduce recidivism in our neighborhoods 
we support local prison to work programs and other initiatives to reduce recidivism making citizens safer 
and saving the taxpayers money 
and the administration of justice should be fair and impartial 
that s why we enacted the fair sentencing act reducing racial disparities in sentencing for drug crimes 
moving forward we will continue to nominate and confirm judges who are men and women of unquestionable talent and character and will always demonstrate their faithfulness to our law and our constitution 
we must help state local territorial and tribal law enforcement work together to combat and prevent drug crime and drug and alcohol abuse which are blights on our communities 
we have increased funding for the byrne justice assistance grant program over the last four years 
we are committed to ending violence against women 
we support reauthorizing the bipartisan violence against women act 
and oppose the proposals by republicans in the house of representatives that would undermine this law and deprive law enforcement of the tools it needs to combat violence against women 
service volunteerism and social innovation president obama has called on all americans to participate in our nation s renewal by serving in our communities 
the democratic party believes as dr martin luther king jr did that everybody can be great because everybody can serve 
the challenges america faces are unprecedented and the new foundation for economic growth we need in america will not be built by washington alone it s going to take all of us working together 
to this end democrats enacted the edward m kennedy serve america act increasing the size of americorps and creating more opportunities for americans of all ages to serve their communities 
president obama and the democrats in congress have also sought to increase the budget for the peace corps 
and today vista is larger stronger and more vital than it has ever been 
we believe solutions to america s challenges are being developed every day at the grassroots level and government should be supporting those efforts 
we ve created a social innovation fund that is leveraging millions in private sector dollars to invest in programs with a proven track record of success 
our nation is experiencing some of the greatest challenges in a generation but it is also a time of great opportunity if we come together as a community 
environment democrats are committed to protecting our natural resources while creating jobs preserving habitats and ensuring that future generations can enjoy our nation s outdoor heritage 
from investing in clean energy to protecting our air land and water democrats have made protecting the environment a top priority 
today we are responsibly developing our natural resources to create clean energy jobs here at home 
while encouraging conservation reducing energy waste and protecting the environment 
president obama has taken the most significant strides in decades to cut pollution and advance public health 
protecting our children and communities from harmful pollution by restoring and advancing safeguards for clean air and water and by working to reduce carbon pollution 
pollutants like nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide particulate matter and mercury are a threat to human health 
and democrats will continue to stand up to polluters in the interest of environmental and public health 
we know that global climate change is one of the biggest threats of this generation an economic environmental and national security catastrophe in the making 
we affirm the science of climate change 
commit to significantly reducing the pollution that causes climate change 
and know we have to meet this challenge by driving smart policies that lead to greater growth in clean energy generation and result in a range of economic and social benefits 
president obama has been a leader on this issue 
we have developed historic fuel efficiency standards that will limit greenhouse gas emissions from our vehicles for the first time in history 
made unprecedented investments in clean energy 
and proposed the first ever carbon pollution limits for new fossil fuel fired power plants 
as we move towards lower carbon emissions we will continue to support smart energy efficient manufacturing 
democrats pledge to continue showing international leadership on climate change 
working toward an agreement to set emission limits in unison with other emerging powers 
democrats will continue pursuing efforts to combat climate change at home as well because reducing our emissions domestically through regulation and market solutions is necessary to continue being an international leader on this issue 
we understand that global climate change may disproportionately affect the poor 
and we are committed to environmental justice 
we are restoring treasured landscapes like the great lakes the florida everglades and local wilderness areas 
we are working with gulf coast states to restore the gulf and hold bp and other responsible parties accountable 
democrats will continue to work with local communities to conserve our publicly owned lands 
and dramatically expand investments in conserving and restoring forests grasslands and wetlands across america for generations to come 
we will ensure that our national parks are protected while expanding opportunities for americans to visit and experience these national treasures 
democrats will continue working to ensure the integrity of the waters americans rely on every day for drinking swimming and fishing by supporting initiatives that restore our rivers oceans coasts and watersheds 
we will preserve landscapes and ecosystems 
and open more lands and waters for hunting fishing and recreation 
this will bolster local economies and is good for communities today and for generations to come 
our opponents have moved so far to the right as to doubt the science of climate change 
advocate the selling of our federal lands 
and threaten to roll back environmental protections that safeguard public health 
their leaders deny the benefits of the clean air and clean water acts benefits like job creation health and the prevention of tens of thousands of premature deaths each year 
they ignore the jobs that are created by promoting outdoor recreation cleaning up our air and promoting a healthy environment 
when president obama took office in january our armed forces were engaged in two wars 
al qaeda which had attacked us on remained entrenched in its safe havens 
many of our alliances were strained 
and our standing in the world had diminished 
around the world and here at home there were those who questioned whether the united states was headed toward inevitable decline 
under the leadership of president obama and the democratic party the tide of war is now receding 
and america is looking ahead to a new future 
we have responsibly ended the war in iraq 
we have struck major blows against al qaeda bringing osama bin laden and other senior al qaeda leaders to justice 
and putting the terrorist organization on the path to defeat 
and we have reversed the momentum of the taliban 
and established the conditions to draw down our forces in afghanistan 
these actions have enabled a broader strategic rebalancing of american foreign policy 
after more than a decade at war we can focus on nation building here at home 
and concentrate our resources and attention abroad on the areas that are the greatest priority moving forward 
this means directing more energy toward crucial problems including longstanding threats like nuclear proliferation 
and emerging dangers such as cyber attacks 
biological weapons 
climate change 
and transnational crime 
and it means a long overdue focus on the world s most dynamic regions and rising centers of influence 
as we rebalance our foreign policy we have rebuilt our relationships around the world 
from europe and asia to the middle east africa and the americas we have strengthened the alliances and partnerships that are so central to global security 
and we have taken steps to reinvigorate international institutions 
all the while we have built the foundation for sustained american leadership by growing our economy 
preserving our unrivaled military strength 
and advancing our values 
president obama and the democratic party know that there is no greater responsibility than protecting the american people 
we also understand the indispensable role that the united states must continue to play in promoting international peace and prosperity 
and because of the steps we have taken the united states is leading once again 
and america is safer stronger and more secure than it was four years ago 
charting a responsible path out of the war in iraq has been a crucial element of president obama s foreign policy and has enabled important shifts in our broader strategy 
then senator obama pledged during the campaign to responsibly end the war in iraq saying it was imperative to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in and that is precisely what he has done 
for over half a decade our focus on iraq meant we had taken our eye off of al qaeda 
and it had cost us thousands of lives a trillion dollars and severely strained our key alliances 
when president obama took office there were over american troops in harm s way in iraq 
today all of those forces are out of iraq and there are no american bases there either 
the iraqi people in continued partnership with the united states now have the opportunity to build a better future 
after taking office president obama removed our combat brigades and ended our combat mission on a month timetable 
and after an interim period in which we continued to advise iraqis and conduct counterterrorism operations we completed the drawdown of all u s troops last december 
this decision was reached after extensive discussions and with the full agreement of the iraqi government 
and it was determined to be in the best interest of both nations 
many republicans including mitt romney would have preferred to leave tens of thousands of u s troops in iraq in an open ended commitment 
against the will of the iraqi government and people 
moving forward president obama and the democratic party are committed to building a robust long term strategic partnership with a sovereign united and democratic iraq in all fields diplomatic economic and security based on mutual interests and mutual respect 
president obama and the democratic party understood that the war in iraq distracted us from confronting many of the most fundamental national security challenges facing the united states 
including the danger posed by international terrorist organizations that threaten the american homeland 
as the bush administration shifted its focus to iraq osama bin laden and al qaeda established safe havens across the border from afghanistan in pakistan 
president obama s decision to end the iraq war freed up military and intelligence resources to refocus on this fight 
and enabled us to shift to a much more effective approach to counterterrorism 
importantly president obama also shifted away from the bush administration s sweeping and internationally divisive rhetoric of a global war on terrorism 
to a more focused effort against an identifiable network of people al qaeda and its affiliates 
that has allowed us to target force with greater precision against those who want to harm americans and attack the united states 
and move away from the type of large scale military deployments characteristic of the previous administration and favored by many republicans today 
as a candidate then senator obama committed to bringing osama bin laden to justice even if that meant crossing the border into pakistan 
as a consequence of the president s decisions and the brave work of our military and intelligence professionals bin laden can no longer threaten the united states and al qaeda s senior leadership has been devastated rendering the group far less capable than it was four years ago 
the al qaeda core in afghanistan and pakistan has never been weaker 
we have also struck blows against al qaeda s leadership in yemen and somalia with the full support and close cooperation of those governments 
at the same time the president and the democratic party understand that we must stay vigilant 
the al qaeda core may be on the path to defeat but the organization and its affiliates remain active in afghanistan pakistan yemen somalia and elsewhere 
for that reason we are committed to an unrelenting pursuit of those who would kill americans or threaten our homeland our allies our partners and our interests around the world 
the united states went into afghanistan after to bring justice to those who had attacked us and to take away al qaeda s safe haven 
but by the time president obama took office we had lost sight of those goals 
so the president refocused our efforts there in setting the clear goal of defeating al qaeda and denying it an ability to reestablish a safe haven in afghanistan 
because of the deteriorating security situation he sent additional resources to reverse the taliban s momentum and to give the afghans the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces 
we have accomplished that and now we have begun the process of bringing our troops home from afghanistan including removing by september 
and with the support of our allies the president has outlined a plan to end the war in afghanistan in 
already the united states and our north atlantic treaty organization allies have begun to transition responsibility to afghan security forces 
at the same time we are keeping up the pressure on the taliban 
pursuing the possibility of a political resolution to parts of the conflict 
and continuing our capacity building efforts 
beyond we will continue to provide counterterrorism and training assistance and to build an enduring relationship with afghanistan as outlined by the u s afghanistan strategic partnership agreement concluded in may 
but we will not build permanent bases in afghanistan 
more broadly we will also continue to support peace and stability in south asia 
pakistan can be a partner in that process 
the united states will make clear that we respect pakistan s sovereignty and democratic institutions 
and that our interest is in putting an end to al qaeda s safe havens and respecting afghan sovereignty 
mitt romney has been both for and against our timeline to end the war in afghanistan 
but he has failed to outline any policy ideas for how he would bring our troops home and at times has suggested he would leave them there indefinitely 
in our continuing efforts to keep america safe president obama and the democratic party believe we must address the threat that nuclear weapons pose to our security and to peace in the world 
despite the two decades that have passed since the end of the cold war large stockpiles of nuclear weapons persist and more nations are interested in acquiring them 
nuclear testing and black market trade in sensitive nuclear materials continue 
and terrorists remain determined to buy build or steal the ultimate weapon 
president obama and the democratic party are committed to preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons 
and to eventually ridding the planet of these catastrophic weapons 
this goal will not be achieved overnight 
it will require patience perseverance and the steady accumulation of concrete actions 
but real progress has already been made 
reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles the obama administration has moved away from cold war thinking by reducing the prominence of nuclear weapons in america s national security strategy and it has urged others to do the same 
as long as these weapons exist the united states will maintain a safe secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and guarantee the defense of our allies 
but president obama has taken important steps to decrease america s nuclear arsenal and is committed to further responsible reductions 
to reduce our warheads and stockpile lower the threat of a nuclear exchange and lay the foundation for future progress president obama negotiated and signed the landmark new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia 
producing cuts in each side s deployed nuclear stockpiles and launchers and allowing us to monitor and verify russia s arsenal 
yet despite bipartisan consensus among former national security advisors secretaries of defense and secretaries of state that new start makes america safer mitt romney strongly objected to the treaty 
moving forward the president will work with russia to achieve additional reductions in stockpiles and nuclear delivery vehicles including tactical and non deployed nuclear weapons 
we will also work to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty 
and seek a new fissile material cut off treaty that prohibits the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons 
preventing nuclear proliferation president obama and the democratic party are also committed to strengthening the nuclear non proliferation treaty as the bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries 
as we work to uphold our obligations under the treaty by reducing stockpiles and recognizing the rights of all rule abiding states to peaceful nuclear energy 
we will insist that countries without nuclear weapons comply with their obligations not to develop them 
and we will ensure that violators face real consequences 
iran president obama working closely with our international partners and congress has put in place unprecedented sanctions against iran 
iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon but has continually failed to meet its obligations under the npt and several united nations security council resolutions 
and it can not demonstrate with any credibility that its program is peaceful 
the president is committed to using all instruments of national power to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons 
when president obama took office iran was ascendant in the region and the international community was divided over how to address iran s nuclear violations 
the president s early offer of engagement with iran quickly rebuffed by the regime allowed the united states to expose iranian intransigence and rally the international community as never before 
working with our european allies and with russia and china the administration gained unprecedented agreement for the toughest ever un sanctions against iran 
laying the foundation for additional national financial and energy sanctions imposed by the united states and other nations 
as a result iran is now increasingly isolated and the regime faces crippling economic pressure pressure that will only build over time 
president obama believes that a diplomatic outcome remains the best and most enduring solution 
at the same time he has also made clear that the window for diplomacy will not remain open indefinitely and that all options including military force remain on the table 
but we have an obligation to use the time and space that exists now to put increasing pressure on the iranian regime to live up to its obligations and rejoin the community of nations or face the consequences 
north korea president obama will also continue to confront north korea another regime that ignores its international obligations by developing nuclear weapons and missile technology with a stark choice take verifiable steps toward denuclearization 
or face increasing isolation and costs from the united states and the international community 
that is why the administration worked with international partners to impose the harshest multilateral sanctions on north korea in history 
and it is why the president has made clear that the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by north korea to states or non state entities would be considered a grave threat to the united states and our allies and we would hold north korea accountable for the consequences of such action 
securing loose nuclear materials the president has led a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world 
hosting a nuclear security summit in washington 
and making concrete progress in locking these materials down 
this is an important goal because the prospect that al qaeda or another terrorist organization might acquire a nuclear device represents an immediate and extreme threat to global security 
at the same time the united states will continue to work with international partners to break up black markets 
detect and intercept nuclear materials in transit 
and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade 
russia crucial to achieving all of these objectives has been and will remain expanded cooperation with russia 
the cold war mentality represented by mitt romney s identification of russia as our number one geopolitical foe ignores the very real common interest we share with russia in reducing nuclear stockpiles 
stopping additional proliferation by countries such as iran and north korea 
and preventing nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists 
the president s reset policy toward russia has produced significant cooperation in these areas as well as in russian support for the northern distribution network that supplies our troops in afghanistan 
we support establishing permanent normal trade relations with russia because it would be good for the u s economy for u s businesses and for u s workers if we do 
and securing russia s accession to the world trade organization is an important step toward encouraging russia to follow a rules based system 
and to protecting the rights of american workers farmers ranchers and firms 
the administration will not put aside our differences but will raise them directly with the russian government 
and we will continue to strongly criticize russian actions that we oppose such as their support for the assad regime in syria 
as we have taken decisive steps to address today s dangers from terrorism and to prevent future nuclear proliferation 
we have also sought to bolster homeland security and head off emerging challenges ranging from cyber and biological threats to climate change and transnational crime 
cybersecurity cybersecurity threats represent one of the most serious potential national security public safety and economic challenges we face 
the very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower individual criminal hackers organized criminal groups terrorist networks and other advanced nations to disrupt the critical infrastructure that is vital to our economy commerce public safety and military 
defending against cyber threats requires networks that are secure trustworthy and resilient 
the president and the administration have taken unprecedented steps to defend america from cyber attacks 
including creating the first military command dedicated to cybersecurity 
and conducting a full review of the federal government s efforts to protect our information and our infrastructure 
we will continue to take steps to deter prevent detect and defend against cyber intrusions by investing in cutting edge research and development 
promoting cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy 
and strengthening private sector and international partnerships 
president obama has supported comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that would help business and government protect against risks of cyber attacks while also safeguarding the privacy rights of our citizens 
and going forward the president will continue to take executive action to strengthen and update our cyber defenses 
biological weapons other dangers pose direct and deadly risks to our health and well being 
the use of a lethal biological agent within a population center would threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of people 
that s why president obama outlined a national strategy for countering biological threats in to address the challenges from proliferation of biological weapons or their use by terrorists 
we will continue to work at home with first responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious disease 
we will also continue our efforts with domestic and international partners to promote global health security and reinforce norms of safe and responsible conduct obtain timely and accurate insight on current and emerging risks take steps to reduce the potential for exploitation expand our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend perpetrators of attacks and communicate with all stakeholders 
climate change the national security threat from climate change is real urgent and severe 
the change wrought by a warming planet will lead to new conflicts over refugees and resources new suffering from drought and famine catastrophic natural disasters and the degradation of vital ecosystems across the globe 
that is why in addition to undertaking measures to enhance energy independence and promote efficiency clean energy and renewable sources of power here at home 
the president and the democratic party have steadily worked to build an international framework to combat climate change 
we will seek to implement agreements and build on the progress made during climate talks in copenhagen cancun and durban working to ensure a response to climate change policy that draws upon decisive action by all nations 
our goal is an effective international effort in which all major economies commit to reduce their emissions 
nations meet their commitments in a transparent manner 
and the necessary financing is mobilized so that developing countries can mitigate the effects of climate change and invest in clean energy technologies 
that is why the obama administration has taken a leadership role in ongoing climate negotiations working to ensure that other major economies like china and india commit to taking meaningful action 
it is also why we have worked regionally to build clean energy partnerships in asia the americas and africa 
transnational crime transnational criminal networks also pose significant national security challenges 
these networks continue to expand dramatically in size and scope harming people worldwide posing threats to stability 
and subverting government institutions through corruption 
transnational criminal organizations have accumulated unprecedented wealth and power through the drug trade arms smuggling human trafficking and other illicit activities penetrating legitimate financial systems and destabilizing commercial markets 
that s why in the obama administration released a comprehensive strategy to combat transnational organized crime 
we are committed to a multidimensional approach that safeguards citizens 
breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks 
disrupts illicit trafficking networks 
fights government corruption 
strengthens the rule of law 
bolsters judicial systems 
and improves transparency 
we have responded to this threat through aggressive targeting of the illicit financial infrastructure supporting cross border criminal activity 
and we will continue to coordinate with other nations and build their capacity to combat these threats 
the greatest dangers we face terrorism nuclear proliferation cyber and biological attacks climate change and transnational crime can not be solved by any one nation alone 
addressing these challenges requires broad and effective global cooperation 
and president obama and the democratic party understand that this depends on close collaboration with our traditional allies 
cultivating partnerships with new centers of influence 
and strong u s leadership within international institutions 
europe the cornerstone of our engagement with the world is our alliances which had been badly damaged under the bush administration 
the president and the democratic party believe the foundation of global security remains our relationships with traditional allies in europe and asia and our enduring commitments to their defense 
that is why president obama has worked to methodically strengthen our alliances there 
while pressing our allies to bear a greater share of the burden for tackling regional and global challenges 
the president and the democratic party recognize america s enduring interest in supporting peace and prosperity in europe 
as well as bolstering the strength and vitality of nato which is critical to the security of the continent and beyond 
a decade of military operations in afghanistan has strengthened nato s fighting skills and enhanced its ability to cooperate at the political level 
this proved critical to the alliance s timely unified and effective response in libya 
going forward we need to further improve the ability of nato countries to operate collectively 
modernizing the alliance will be challenging given fiscal constraints on both sides of the atlantic 
but as large scale military involvement in afghanistan winds down nato has an opportunity to focus on further developing the capabilities required to address st century challenges 
therefore we will continue to urge our nato allies to pool share and specialize their capabilities 
and to improve their capacity for effective coalition operations 
meanwhile even as the presence of u s forces in europe necessarily evolves the united states will maintain its article collective security commitments to nato 
and will continue to leverage america s comparative advantage in high end military capabilities to ensure the defense of our allies 
for example the president is moving forward with a phased adaptive approach to european ballistic missile defense that will protect both europe and the united states from missile threats emanating from iran and elsewhere 
we believe that the united states and russia can cooperate on missile defense 
but we have also made clear that we will move forward with our system beginning with the steps we have taken to deploy it in poland turkey and romania 
asia pacific as we have sought to rebalance our foreign policy we have also turned greater attention to strengthening our alliances and expanding our partnerships in the asia pacific region 
in part this is in recognition that the united states has been and always will be a pacific power 
and in part it is a recognition that america s future security and prosperity will be fundamentally interconnected with asia given its status as the fastest growing economic region with most of the world s nuclear powers and about half of the world s population 
the president has therefore made a deliberate and strategic decision that the united states will play a larger and long term role in shaping this region and its future 
president obama has made modernizing america s defense posture across the asia pacific a top priority 
we remain committed to defending and deepening our partnerships with our allies in the region australia japan new zealand the philippines south korea and thailand 
we will maintain a strong presence in japan and on the korean peninsula to deter and defend against provocations by states like north korea 
while enhancing our presence in southeast asia and in australia 
we will also expand our networks of security cooperation with other emerging partners throughout the region to combat terrorism counter proliferation provide disaster relief fight piracy and ensure maritime security including cooperation in the south china sea 
and we will continue to invest in a long term strategic partnership with india to support its ability to serve as a regional economic anchor and provider of security in the broader indian ocean region 
meanwhile the president is committed to continuing efforts to build a cooperative relationship with china while being clear and candid when we have differences 
the world has a profound interest in the rise of a peaceful and prosperous china 
but china must also understand that it must abide by clear international standards and rules of the road 
china can be a partner in reducing tensions on the korean peninsula countering proliferation in iran confronting climate change increasing trade and resolving other global challenges 
president obama will continue to seek additional opportunities for cooperation with china including greater communication between our militaries 
we will do this even as we continue to be clear about the importance of the chinese government upholding international economic rules regarding currency export financing intellectual property indigenous innovation and workers rights 
we will consistently speak out for the importance of respecting the universal human rights of the chinese people 
including the right of the tibetan people to preserve their cultural and religious identity 
and we remain committed to a one china policy the taiwan relations act and the peaceful resolution of cross strait issues that is consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of taiwan 
the middle east president obama and the democratic party maintain an unshakable commitment to israel s security 
a strong and secure israel is vital to the united states not simply because we share strategic interests but also because we share common values 
for this reason despite budgetary constraints the president has worked with congress to increase security assistance to israel every single year since taking office providing nearly billion in the past three years 
the administration has also worked to ensure israel s qualitative military edge in the region 
and we have deepened defense cooperation including funding the iron dome system to help israel address its most pressing threats including the growing danger posed by rockets and missiles emanating from the gaza strip lebanon syria and iran 
the president s consistent support for israel s right to defend itself and his steadfast opposition to any attempt to delegitimize israel on the world stage are further evidence of our enduring commitment to israel s security 
it is precisely because of this commitment that president obama and the democratic party seek peace between israelis and palestinians 
a just and lasting israeli palestinian accord producing two states for two peoples would contribute to regional stability and help sustain israel s identity as a jewish and democratic state 
at the same time the president has made clear that there will be no lasting peace unless israel s security concerns are met 
president obama will continue to press arab states to reach out to israel 
we will continue to support israel s peace treaties with egypt and jordan which have been pillars of peace and stability in the region for many years 
and even as the president and the democratic party continue to encourage all parties to be resolute in the pursuit of peace 
we will insist that any palestinian partner must recognize israel s right to exist reject violence and adhere to existing agreements 
elsewhere in the region president obama is committed to maintaining robust security cooperation with gulf cooperation council states and our other partners aimed at deterring aggression 
checking iran s destabilizing activities 
ensuring the free flow of commerce essential to the global economy 
and building a regional security architecture to counter terrorism proliferation ballistic missiles piracy and other common threats 
jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel 
the americas in the americas we have deepened our economic and security ties with countries throughout the hemisphere from canada and mexico to brazil and chile and el salvador 
we have strengthened cooperation with mexico colombia and throughout central america to combat narco traffickers and criminal gangs that threaten their citizens and ours 
we will also work to disrupt organized crime networks seeking to use the caribbean to smuggle drugs into our country 
as we collectively confront these challenges we will continue to support the region s security forces border security and police with the equipment training and technologies they need to keep their communities safe 
we will improve coordination and share more information so that those who traffic in drugs and in human beings have fewer places to hide 
and we will continue to put unprecedented pressure on cartel finances including in the united states 
africa we will continue to partner with african nations to combat al qaeda affiliates in places like somalia and to bring to justice those who commit mass atrocities like joseph kony 
we have made great efforts to reduce the violence in darfur and built international support for a successful referendum on south sudan s future 
and in his first visit as president to the united nations president obama advanced initiatives to strengthen un peacekeeping capabilities in africa 
this includes providing equipment training and logistical support for un and african union missions in darfur and somalia 
the president has also worked to help african nations grow their economies and we have opened trade and investment opportunities across the continent 
the united nations international institutions most prominently the united nations have been a centerpiece of international order since the mid th century 
and just as american leadership was essential to forging the architecture for international cooperation after world war ii the president and the democratic party are committed to modernizing its infrastructure for the st century 
working to reform international bodies 
and strengthen national and multilateral capabilities to advance peace security and opportunity 
we have restored america s leadership at the un by cooperating with our partners there when we can and respectfully disagreeing with them when we must reversing the previous administration s disdain for the un 
the president s leadership at the un has enabled us to make real progress on a number of top national security priorities including getting russia and china on board to implement the toughest un sanctions ever on iran and north korea 
as the united states works with allies and partners to establish an international order that advances peace and prosperity president obama and the democratic party will continue to build three key pillars of american global leadership a prosperous and inclusive economy 
our unsurpassed military strength 
and an enduring commitment to advancing universal values 
to allow each american to pursue the opportunity upon which our prosperity depends we are investing in the sources of our long term economic strength 
access to a complete and competitive education for every american 
affordable health care so our people businesses and government are not constrained by rising costs 
training to allow our workers to adapt and win in a rapidly changing global economy 
transformations in the way we produce and use energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and create new jobs and industry 
infrastructure that fuels commerce 
cutting edge developments in science and innovation that support our economy defense and technological leadership 
and making the hard decisions to cut our deficit and put our fiscal house in order 
and because a growing and open global economy serves as a source of opportunity for the american people and a source of strength for the united states the president and the democratic party have coordinated our economic actions with other countries to address financial crises 
and head off renewed cycles of boom and bust 
we have reformed international institutions to give emerging economies a greater role and more responsibility 
we have promoted trade that is free and fair 
and we have supported global economic development 
abroad just as we have at home we have sought to build a new model for st century economic growth that is fair and in which every nation plays by the rules 
a model where workers rights are respected 
businesses compete on a level playing field 
and intellectual property and new technologies are protected 
currencies must be market driven so no nation has an unfair advantage 
reforms must protect consumers from abuse and reflect a global commitment to end corruption 
and we will continue to champion sustainable growth that includes the clean energy that creates green jobs and combats climate change 
addressing the global financial crisis alongside our global partners we took decisive actions to address the global financial crisis and have worked together to make the global economy and financial system more stable and secure 
while europe remains a significant risk to the global economy and while the problems there will not be solved overnight europe s leaders have made clear they will do what is necessary to preserve financial stability in the eurozone and have the collective ability to address their economic challenges 
we have been and will continue to be in frequent contact with our european allies to discuss best practices and share valuable lessons from our own experience reversing our economic downturn helping them chart the best way forward 
as we continue to work with traditional centers of influence we have also reached out to emerging economies to give them a greater voice and a greater stake in the global economy 
we have made the g the premier forum for international economic coordination in recognition of the fact that st century economic discussions must include countries like china india indonesia and brazil 
and together the nations of the g brought the world economy back from the brink of another depression 
free and fair trade we have also sought to promote free and fair trade 
because of the economic dynamism of the asia pacific region which is already home to more than half the global economy expanding trade with that region is critical to creating jobs and opportunities for the american people 
building on the free trade agreement with south korea that president obama signed we are working with our partners in the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to create a seamless regional economy 
promote green growth 
and coordinate regulatory reform 
alongside australia brunei darussalam chile malaysia new zealand peru singapore and vietnam we are on track to finalize the trans pacific partnership a historic high standard agreement that will address new and emerging trade issues 
lower barriers to the free flow of trade and investment 
increase exports 
and create more american jobs 
exploring opportunities to shape the multilateral trading system to reflect the role and responsibility of major emerging markets in the global economy is a critical part of the president s trade agenda 
we will work to expand free and fair trade in the americas as well 
we already export more than three times as much to latin america as we do to china and we will pursue additional opportunities to expand commerce and promote shared prosperity 
last year the president signed free trade agreements with panama and colombia agreements that will significantly boost u s exports and support thousands of jobs here at home while protecting labor rights the environment and intellectual property 
because the caribbean is an important region to our country we will continue to support robust trade and economic relationships with our partners there 
and across the region we are moving ahead with open skies agreements to expand opportunities for commercial aviation and to bring our people and businesses closer together 
we have also worked to ensure that american businesses and workers are competing on an even footing with our international competitors and we have not hesitated to take action 
that s why the obama administration has brought trade cases against china at twice the rate of the previous administration 
and recently set up a new interagency trade enforcement center which substantially expands our ability to investigate and take action against unfair trade practices around the world 
advancing global development president obama recognizes that promoting global development is a strategic economic and moral imperative for the united states 
development expands markets for american products and creates american jobs 
strong and prosperous regional partners are critical to addressing global challenges 
ending regional conflicts 
and countering the spread of global criminal networks 
and good governance and stability can not take root and basic human dignity can not be protected where poverty reigns and people lack access to the food basic education clean water and medicine they need to survive 
for these reasons the president this year announced a new strategy toward sub saharan africa that commits to promoting economic growth including through increased trade and investment 
they are also why we are providing robust trade and investment support to africa and building a trade and investment partnership with the countries of east africa because we believe that the private sector will be the engine of prosperity in the developing world 
the administration continues to work to promote opportunity and development in sub saharan africa by improving the region s trade competitiveness encouraging economic diversification and ensuring that the benefits from growth are broad based 
combating hiv aids and infectious disease recognizing that health is a prerequisite for development the president has made unprecedented progress in the global fight against hiv aids and other infectious diseases 
building on the strong foundation created during the previous administration the president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar has expanded its prevention care and treatment programming 
as a result pepfar now has made significant investments in more than countries and we set a goal to roughly double the number of lifesaving anti retroviral treatments we provide by the end of 
with his latest budget the president is fulfilling his historic commitment to request billion over three years for the global fund 
and the president remains committed to robust funding for pepfar and the global fund in the future 
and president obama lifted the year ban that prevented non citizens living with hiv from entering the united states allowing the world s largest group of hiv aids researchers policymakers medical professionals and advocates to convene in washington to continue their efforts to improve prevention and treatment 
our efforts to combat hiv aids are part of a broader commitment to address the challenges posed by infectious disease 
over the past four years the administration has leveraged billions of dollars in commitments from donors to meet the demand for new vaccines making it possible to immunize millions of children and prevent premature deaths 
ensuring food security the president and the democratic party believe that true development requires much more than delivering aid it requires building the capacity of governments and peoples so that assistance is no longer needed 
that is why the administration through its feed the future initiative has with the g and other countries mobilized more than billion for a global food security effort aimed at building the capacity of nations to feed themselves 
this year the president launched the next phase of this global effort a major new food security partnership to reduce hunger and lift tens of millions of people from poverty across africa 
these efforts partner with african countries to improve nutrition for children 
mitigate risks from volatile food prices 
increase private capital investments 
expand access to technologies and information required to boost food production 
and provide greater assistance to countries that implement agricultural reforms 
responding to humanitarian crises together with the american people and the international community we will continue to respond to humanitarian crises around the globe 
we will come to the aid of countries during their times of need just as we did following the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan 
and as we did in the aftermath of haiti s catastrophic earthquake in january we will provide critical aid to countries facing devastating circumstances to meet their acute short term needs and foster long term recovery 
the president led an unprecedented international effort in response to haiti s natural disaster committing over billion to relief reconstruction and recovery and launching a multifaceted effort to improve health promote food security and strengthen economic security 
while major challenges remain president obama has supported a sustained commitment to haiti s reconstruction and the administration has continued to assist in haiti s development 
america s unrivaled military capabilities represent a second core pillar of our global leadership 
after more than a decade of war we have an opportunity to retool our armed forces and our defense strategy to ensure we both maintain the world s most capable military and adapt to the challenges of the st century 
the president and the democratic party understand that we have a special obligation to every soldier sailor airman marine and coast guardsman who puts their life on the line for our nation 
we must send them into harm s way only when it s absolutely necessary 
when we do we must ensure they have the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done 
and we have to take care of our troops their families and our veterans when they come home 
eleven years of continuous military operations and repeated deployments to iraq and afghanistan have stretched our forces and strained their families 
going forward our troops will face fewer deployments allowing them more time to train and ensuring that they are ready for the full range of missions they may have to face 
in our current fiscal environment we must also make tough budgetary decisions across the board and that includes within the defense budget 
the budget control act enacted by congress last year with the support of republicans and democrats alike mandates reductions in federal spending including defense spending 
the administration has worked with congress to make these decisions which has been a strategy driven process 
as we look beyond the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the conclusion of long term nation building with large military footprints we will be able to ensure our security with a more agile and more flexible force 
at the same time we will continue to emphasize forward engagement in critical regions 
while enhancing robust security partnerships to share the burden 
and we will continue to get rid of outdated cold war era systems so that we can invest in cutting edge technologies and maintain a versatile set of capabilities required to execute a wide range of military missions 
america s leadership extends beyond our economic prosperity and military might it is also rooted in our enduring commitment to advancing a core set of universal values 
these include an individual s freedom to speak their mind assemble without fear have access to information worship as they please and choose their own leaders 
they also include dignity tolerance and equality among all people and the fair and equitable administration of justice 
the united states was founded upon a belief in these values and people of every race region and religion around the globe have claimed these principles as their own 
the president and the democratic party believe that nations that embrace these values for their citizens are ultimately more prosperous peaceful and friendly to the united states than those that do not 
staying true to our values at home we must always seek to uphold these values at home not just when it is easy but more importantly when it is hard 
advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront threats like terrorism but the president and the democratic party believe these practices must always be in line with our constitution 
preserve our people s privacy and civil liberties 
and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so well 
that is why the president banned torture without exception in his first week in office 
that is why we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law 
that is why we are substantially reducing the population at guantánamo bay without adding to it 
and we remain committed to working with all branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests and our values 
standing with those demanding greater freedom as we continue to perfect our union here at home setting an example for others to follow we will also continue to champion universal rights abroad 
we recognize that different cultures and traditions give life to these values in distinct ways 
and each country will inevitably chart its own course 
america will not impose any system of government on another country 
but we also know that the sovereignty of nations can not strangle the liberty of individuals 
so as people around the world yearn for greater freedom we will continue to support progress toward more accountable democratic governance 
and the exercise of universal rights 
we will do so through a variety of means by speaking out for universal rights 
bolstering fragile democracies and civil society 
and supporting the dignity that comes with development 
across the middle east and north africa we have stood with the people demanding political change and seeking their rights during the arab spring 
since the beginning of the protests in tunisia the united states has consistently opposed violence against innocent civilians 
supported a set of universal rights for the people of the region 
and supported processes of political and economic reform 
when the egyptian people flooded tahrir square in cairo demanding democracy the administration actively engaged the egyptian government military and people in support of a transition away from decades of dictatorship and towards democracy 
in libya we built an international coalition and intervened alongside nato and other partner nations to protect the libyan people and support them as they ended muammar qadhafi s brutal reign 
in iran president obama spoke out in support of the prodemocracy protestors and imposed human rights sanctions on the iranian government 
in yemen we worked with gulf cooperation council states to facilitate a peaceful transition of power 
and in syria we have led the international community to politically and economically isolate the regime to increase pressure on president assad to step down 
and to provide assistance to unify the syrian opposition in order to enable a stable transition 
moving forward we will work to hasten the end of the assad regime and support a political transition to a stable and democratic syria 
we will continue to support the consolidation of democratic transitions in egypt libya tunisia and yemen 
and we will engage governments and civil society across the region on behalf of genuine efforts to promote political and economic reforms that are responsive to the people of the region 
the arab spring represents the world s most sweeping recent movement toward democracy but it is not an isolated case 
across the globe people are demanding more from their governments and when they do they will continue to find support and partnership in the united states 
for example in burma we successfully employed a combination of sanctions and engagement to encourage the government to open up political space and release political prisoners 
our historic opening to burma will continue to incentivize a democratic transition a deeper engagement with the united states and national reconciliation among burma s many different ethnic groups 
and because human rights violations persist we will continue to speak clearly about the additional steps that must be taken for the government of burma to have a better relationship with the united states 
in africa the administration engaged to ensure a legitimate transfer of power in cote d ivoire supported the independence of south sudan and remains actively involved in resolving the issues between sudan and south sudan 
in the americas we see vibrant democracies in countries from mexico to brazil and costa rica to chile 
we have also seen historic peaceful transfers of power in places like el salvador and uruguay 
yet despite the region s democratic progress stark inequalities in political and economic power endure 
we will continue to press for more transparent and accountable governance 
and we will promote greater freedom in cuba and venezuela until all their citizens enjoy the universal rights they deserve 
under president obama we have undertaken the most significant efforts in decades to engage the cuban people 
we have focused on the importance of the family ties between cuban americans and their relatives still living under oppression 
we have taken additional steps to bolster cuban civil society expanding purposeful exchanges that bolster independent religious groups on the island and enhancing the free flow of information to from and among the cuban people 
going forward we will continue to support the cuban people s desire to freely determine their own future 
promoting transparent accountable governance and the rule of law to promote transparent and accountable government worldwide we joined with brazil to launch and co chair the international open government partnership 
fifty five countries now belong to the partnership representing a quarter of the world s people each of which has outlined concrete credible steps to open the work of government so citizens are empowered problems are solved and democracy is strengthened 
the president and democrats know that a commitment to the rule of law and effective judicial institutions are essential to sustainable economic development and must remain a core american value in the years to come 
that is why the obama administration has successfully pressed for international action against government corruption through the g 
and promoted new initiatives to help countries develop stronger judicial institutions 
because the public s rights freedoms and access to economic opportunity depend on the rule of law we will continue to work in partnership with our allies to promote this important value around the world 
standing up for women s rights around the globe as we work to advance universal values and human dignity the president and the democratic party understand the critical importance of expanding protections and opportunities for women and girls around the world 
ensuring full equality and providing women and girls the opportunity to learn earn a livable wage and participate in public decision making are essential to reduce violence improve economies and strengthen democracy 
to continue to make progress at home and advance women s rights and opportunities abroad we will urge ratification of the convention for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women 
president obama secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and the state department are committed to advancing the rights of women and girls as a central focus of u s diplomatic development and defense interests 
we will continue to promote the full engagement of women in the political and economic spheres 
we will work to address underlying socio economic problems including women s access to health education and food security 
and we will ensure that women are equal participants in reconciliation and development in areas affected by conflict 
president obama and the democratic party are committed to supporting family planning around the globe to help women care for their families support their communities and lead their countries to be healthier and more productive 
that s why in his first month in office president obama overturned the global gag rule a ban on federal funds to foreign family planning organizations that provided information about counseling on or offered abortions 
and that is why the administration has supported lifesaving family planning health information and services 
the president and the democratic party believe that trafficking in persons is both an affront to our fundamental values and 
as a source of funds for transnational criminals and terrorist organization a threat to national and international security 
the obama administration has used bilateral and multilateral diplomacy targeted foreign assistance training programs public outreach and law enforcement to combat trafficking in persons across the globe 
the administration has continued to provide annual assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of foreign governments efforts to address the issue encouraging all countries to do more and calling out countries that have failed to do enough 
and the administration has provided technical assistance to improve law enforcement and grants to support grassroots prevention efforts around the world targeting sex and labor trafficking child sex tourism forced child labor and other abuses 
the administration is also committed to taking action at home to fight trafficking including the sex trafficking of young girls 
gay rights as human rights recognizing that gay rights are human rights the president and his administration have vowed to actively combat efforts by other nations that criminalize homosexual conduct or ignore abuse 
under the obama administration american diplomats must raise the issue wherever harassment or abuse arises and they are required to record it in the state department s annual report on human rights 
and the state department is funding a program that finances gay rights organizations to combat discrimination violence and other abuses 
internet freedom the obama administration has led the world to recognize and defend internet freedom the freedom of expression assembly and association online for people everywhere through coalitions of countries and by empowering individuals with innovative technologies 
the administration has built partnerships to support an internet that is secure and reliable and that is respectful of u s intellectual property free flow of information and privacy 
to preserve the internet as a platform for commerce debate learning and innovation in the st century we successfully negotiated international internet policymaking principles 
and oppose the extension of intergovernmental controls over the internet 
through all these actions america is leading again 
by responsibly ending the wars 
rebalancing our foreign policy 
taking concrete steps to address the greatest threats to our country 
cooperating with allies and partners to tackle common challenges 
reinvigorating international institutions 
and sustaining and building the core pillars of u s leadership 
president obama and the democratic party have worked to ensure that the st century remains an american one 
that is why we are stronger abroad and safer and more secure at home than we were four years ago 
the united states continues to move forward towards a future of strong and sustained growth 
thanks to the leadership of president obama and democrats around the country we re fighting back from the deepest economic crisis since the great depression by making investments to create jobs 
grow the middle class 
and lay the foundations for an economy that out educates out builds and out innovates the rest of the world 
today america is both stronger and safer than it was four years ago 
now we must continue the work we ve started so that the united states of america never fails to meet the tests of our time
