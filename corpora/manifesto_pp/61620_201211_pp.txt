the republican platform is a statement of who we are and what we believe as a party 
and our vision for a stronger and freer america 
the pursuit of opportunity has defined america from our very beginning 
this is a land of opportunity 
the american dream is a dream of equal opportunity for all 
and the republican party is the party of opportunity 
today that american dream is at risk 
our nation faces unprecedented uncertainty with great fiscal and economic challenges 
and under the current administration has suffered through the longest and most severe economic downturn since the great depression 
our middle class has felt that burden most acutely 
federalism is threatened 
and liberty retreats 
for the world this has been four years of lost american leadership 
leadership that depends upon economic vitality 
and peace through strength 
our nation and our people can not afford the status quo 
we must begin anew with profound changes in the way government operates 
the way it budgets taxes and regulates 
jeffersons vision of a wise and frugal government must be restored 
providence has put us at the fork in the road and we must answer the question if not us who 
if not now when 
that is the choice facing the american people this november 
or a positive optimistic view of an opportunity society where any american who works hard dreams big and follows the rules can achieve anything he or she wants 
the american people possess vast reserves of courage and determination and the capacity to hear the truth and chart a strong course 
they are eager for the opportunity to take on lifes challenges and through faith and hard work transform the future for the better 
they are the most generous people on earth giving sacrificially of their time talent and treasure 
this platform affirms that america has always been a place of grand dreams and even grander realities 
and so it will be again if we return government to its proper role making it smaller and smarter 
if we restructure governments most important domestic programs to avoid their fiscal collapse 
if we keep taxation litigation and regulation to a minimum 
if we celebrate success entrepreneurship and innovation 
if we lift up the middle class 
if we hand over to the next generation a legacy of growth and prosperity 
rather than entitlements and indebtedness 
that same commitment must be present both here at home and abroad 
we are a party that knows the difference between international acclaim and world leadership 
we will lift the torch of freedom and democracy to inspire all those who would be free 
as president reagan issued the clarion call to tear down this wall so must we always stand against tyranny and oppression 
we will always support and cherish our men and women in uniform who defend our liberties with their lives 
we possess an owners manual the constitution of the united states the greatest political document ever written 
that sacred document shows us the path forward 
trust the people 
limit government 
respect federalism 
guarantee opportunity not outcomes 
adhere to the rule of law 
reaffirm that our rights come from god 
are protected by government 
and that the only just government is one that truly governs with the consent of the governed 
the principles written in the constitution are secured by the character of the american people 
values matter 
character counts 
mitt romney and paul ryan understand these great truths 
they share a positive vision for america – a vision of america renewed and strong 
they know americas best days lay ahead 
it will take honest results oriented conservative leadership to enact good policies for our people 
they will provide it 
it is both a vision of where we are headed and an invitation to join us in that journey 
it is about the great dreams and opportunities that have always been america 
and must remain the essence of america for generations to come 
may god continue to shed his grace on the united states of america 
we are the party of maximum economic freedom and the prosperity freedom makes possible 
prosperity is the product of selfdiscipline work savings and investment by individual americans 
raise their children by their own values 
practice their faith 
and build communities of selfreliant neighbors 
it is also the means by which the united states is able to assert global leadership 
the vigor of our economy makes possible our military strength 
and is critical to our national security 
this years election is a chance to restore the proven values of the american free enterprise system 
we offer our republican vision of a free people using their godgiven talents combined with hard work selfreliance ethical conduct and the pursuit of opportunity to achieve great things for themselves and the greater community 
our vision of an opportunity society stands in stark contrast to the current administrations policies that expand entitlements and guarantees 
create new public programs 
and provide expensive government bailouts 
that road has created a culture of dependency 
and massive debt 
republicans believe in the great american dream with its economics of inclusion enabling everyone to have a chance to own invest build and prosper 
it is the opposite of the policies which for the last three and a half years have stifled growth destroyed jobs halted investment created unprecedented uncertainty and prolonged the worst economic downturn since the great depression 
those policies have placed the federal government in the drivers seat 
rather than relying on energetic and entrepreneurial americans to rebuild the economy from the ground up 
excessive taxation and regulation impede economic development 
lowering taxes promotes substantial economic growth 
and reducing regulation encourages business formation and job creation 
knowing that a republican president and congress will jumpstart an economic renewal that creates opportunity 
rewards work and saving 
and unleashes the productive genius of the american people 
because the gop is the great opportunity party this is our pledge to workers without jobs 
families without savings 
and neighborhoods without hope 
together we can get our country back on track 
expanding its bounty 
renewing its faith 
and fulfilling its promise of a better life 
the best jobs program is economic growth 
we do not offer yet another madeinwashington package of subsidies and spending to create temporary or artificial jobs 
we want much more than that 
we want a roaring job market to match a roaring economy 
instead what this administration has given us is consecutive months of unemployment above percent the longest period of high unemployment since the great depression 
republicans will pursue free market policies that are the surest way to boost employment 
and create job growth and economic prosperity for all 
the tax system must be simplified 
government spending and regulation must be reined in 
american companies must be more competitive in the world market 
and we must be aggressive in promoting us products abroad and securing open markets for them 
a federalstateprivate partnership must invest in the nations infrastructure roads bridges airports ports and water systems among others 
federal training programs have to be overhauled and made relevant for the workplace of the twentyfirst century 
potential employers need certainty and predictability for their hiring decisions 
and the team of a republican president and congress will create the confidence that will get americans back to work 
americas small businesses are the backbone of the us economy employing tens of millions of workers 
small businesses create the vast majority of jobs patents and us exporters 
under the current administration we have the lowest rate of business startups in thirty years 
small businesses are the leaders in the worlds advances in technology and innovation 
and we pledge to strengthen that role and foster small business entrepreneurship 
while small businesses have significantly contributed to the nations economic growth our government has failed to meet its small business goals year after year 
and failed to overcome burdensome regulatory contracting and capital barriers 
this impedes their growth 
we will reform the tax code to allow businesses to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs for our families friends and neighbors all across america 
we will encourage investments in small businesses 
we will create an environment where adequate financing and credit are available to spur manufacturing and expansion 
we will serve as aggressive advocates for small businesses 
taxes by their very nature reduce a citizens freedom 
their proper role in a free society should be to fund services that are essential and authorized by the constitution such as national security 
and the care of those who can not care for themselves 
we reject the use of taxation to redistribute income 
fund unnecessary or ineffective programs 
or foster the crony capitalism that corrupts both politicians and corporations 
our goal is a tax system that is simple transparent flatter and fair 
in contrast the current irs code is like a patchwork quilt stitched together over time from mismatched pieces and is beyond the comprehension of the average citizen 
a reformed code should promote simplicity and coherence 
savings and innovation 
increase american competitiveness 
and recognize the burdens on families with children 
to that end we propose toextend the and tax relief packagescommonly known as the bush tax cutspending reform of the tax code 
to keep tax rates from rising on income interest dividends and capital gains 
reform the tax code by reducing marginal tax rates by percent acrosstheboard in a revenueneutral manner 
eliminate the taxes on interest dividends and capital gains altogether for lower and middleincome taxpayers 
end the death tax 
and repeal the alternative minimum tax 
american businesses now face the worlds highest corporate tax rate 
it reduces their worldwide competitiveness 
encourages corporations to move overseas 
lessens investment 
cripples job creation 
lowers us wages 
and fosters the avoidance of tax liabilitywithout actually increasing tax revenues 
to level the international playing field and to spur job creation here at home we call for a reduction of the corporate rate to keep us corporations competitive internationally 
with a permanent research and development tax credit 
and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax 
we also support the recommendation of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform as well as the current presidents export council to switch to a territorial system of corporate taxation so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for jobcreating investment here at home without additional penalty 
we oppose retroactive taxation 
and we condemn attempts by activist judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse by ordering higher taxes 
we oppose tax policies that divide americans or promote class warfare 
because of the vital role of religious organizations charities and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering benevolence and patriotism they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should continue to be tax deductible 
in any restructuring of federal taxation to guard against hypertaxation of the american people any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the sixteenth amendment which established the federal income tax 
the massive federal government is structurally and financially broken 
for decades it has been pushed beyond its core functions increasing spending to unsustainable levels 
elected officials have overpromised and overspent and now the bills are due 
unless we take dramatic action now young americans and their children will inherit an unprecedented legacy of enormous and unsustainable debt with the interest alone consuming an everincreasing portion of the countrys wealth 
the specter of national bankruptcy that now hangs over much of europe is a warning to us as well 
over the last three and a half years while cutting the deflfense budget the current admincoistration has added an additional trillion to the national debtnow approximately trillion the largest amount in us history 
in fiscal year spending reached trillion nearly a quarter of our gross domestic product 
adjusted for inflation thats more than three times its peak level in world war ii 
and almost half of every dollar spent was borrowed money 
three programsmedicare medicaid and social security account for over percent of total spending 
while these levels of spending and debt are already harming job creation and growth projections of future spending growth are nothing short of catastrophic both economically and socially 
and those dire projections do not include the fiscal nightmare of obamacare with over trillion in new taxes multiple mandates and a crushing price tag 
we can preempt the debt explosion 
backed by a republican senate and house our next president will propose immediate reductions in federal spending 
as a down payment on the much larger task of longrange fiscal control 
first is it within the constitutional scope of the federal government 
second is it effective and absolutely necessary 
and third is it sufficiently important to justify borrowing especially foreign borrowing to fund it 
against those standards we will measure programs from international population control to californias federally subsidized highspeed train to nowhere and terminate programs that dont measure up 
cutting spending is not enough 
it must be accompanied by major structural reforms 
increased productivity 
use of technology 
and longterm government downsizing 
that both reduce debt and deficits 
and ignite economic growth 
we must restructure the twentieth century entitlement state 
so the missions of important programs can succeed in the twentyfirst century 
medicare in particular is the largest driver of future debt 
our reform of healthcare will empower millions of seniors to control their personal healthcare decisions 
unlike obamacare that empowered a handful of bureaucrats to cut medicare in ways that will deny care for the elderly 
we must also change the budget process itself 
from its beginning its design has enabled rather than restrained reckless spending by giving procedural cover to members of congress 
the budget process gave us the insidious term tax expenditure which means that any earnings the government allows a taxpayer to keep through a deduction exemption or credit are equivalent to spending the same amount on some program 
it also lumped a broad range of diverse programs under the heading of entitlement as if veterans benefits and welfare checks belong in the same category 
far worse the process assumes every spending program will be permanent and every tax cut will be temporary 
it refuses to recognize the beneficial budgetary impact of lower tax rates 
and it calls a spending increase a cut if it is less than the rate of inflation 
republican members of congress have repeatedly tried to reform the budget process to make it more transparent and accountable in particular by voting for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution 
following the lead of states which have put that restraint into their own constitutions 
we call for a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority for any tax increase with exceptions for only war and national emergencies 
and imposing a cap limiting spending to the historical average percentage of gdp so that future congresses can not balance the budget by raising taxes 
a sound monetary policy is critical for maintaining a strong economy 
inflation diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar at home and abroad and is a hidden tax on the american people 
moreover the inflation tax is regressive 
punishes those who save 
transfers wealth from main street to wall street 
and has grave implications for seniors living on fixed incomes 
because the federal reserves monetary policy actions affect both inflation and economic activity those actions should be transparent 
moreover the feds important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner 
a free society demands that the sun shine on all elements of government 
therefore the republican party will work to advance substantive legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the federal reserve the federal open market committee and the feds dealings with foreign central banks 
the first step to increasing transparency and accountability is through an annual audit of the federal reserves activities 
such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the federal reserve remains insulated from political pressures 
and so its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than on political pressures for easy money and loose credit 
determined to crush the doubledigit inflation that was part of the carter administrations economic legacy president reagan shortly after his inauguration established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for us currency 
now three decades later as we face the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current administrations policies we propose a similar commission to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar 
homeownership expands personal liberty builds communities and helps americans create wealth 
the american dream is not a stale slogan 
it is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people 
it means a decent place to live 
a safe place to raise kids 
a welcoming place to retire 
it bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and in the process create caring neighborhoods 
homeownership is best fostered by a growing economy with low interest rates 
as well as prudent regulation financial education and targeted assistance to responsible borrowers 
the collapse of the housing market over the last four years has been not only a severe blow to the entire economy but also a personal tragedy to millions of americans whose homes have lost value and to so many others who have lost their homes 
combined with high unemployment that decline has left countless homeowners saddled with mortgages exceeding the value of their homes 
the response of the current administration has done little to improve and much to worsen the situation 
by discouraging private sector investment it has stalled the housing recovery 
its massive intervention in the housing market with the federal housing administration fha fannie mae and freddie mac backing nearly all new mortgages has hit the taxpayers with a bill for almost billion to bail out the latter two institutions 
it has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs 
making matters worse the congress under democrat control enacted the doddfrank act a massive labyrinth of costly new regulations that deter lenders from lending to creditworthy homebuyers 
and that disproportionately harms small and community banks 
as a result home sales remain weak investment in housing remains depressed construction industry jobs remain down and mortgage lending has yet to recover to precrisis levels 
we must establish a mortgage finance system based on competition and free enterprise that is transparent 
encourages the private sector to return to housing 
and promotes personal responsibility on the part of borrowers 
policies that promote reliance on private capital like private mortgage insurance will be critical to scaling back the federal role in the housing market 
and avoiding future taxpayer bailouts 
reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on acceptable lending practices 
compliance with regulatory standards should provide a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation 
fannie mae and freddie mac were a primary cause of the housing crisis because their implicit government guarantee allowed them to avoid market discipline and make risky investments 
their favored political status enriched their politicallyconnected executives and their shareholders at the expense of the nation 
both fannie mae and freddie mac should be wound down in size and scope and their officials should be held to account 
the fha tripled in size to more than trillion under the current administration has crowded out the private sector and is at risk of requiring a taxpayer bailout 
it must be downsized 
and limited to helping firsttime homebuyers and lowand moderateincome borrowers 
taxpayer dollars should not be used to bail out borrowers and lenders by funding principal writedowns 
while the federal government must prosecute mortgage fraud and other financial crimes any settlements received thereby should be directed to individuals harmed by the misconduct not diverted to pay for unrelated programs 
fdic insurance for bank depositors must be preserved 
however to correct for the moral hazard created by deposit insurance banks should be well capitalized which is the best insurance against future taxpayer bailouts 
the federal government has a role in housing by enforcing nondiscrimination laws and assisting lowincome families and the elderly with safe and adequate shelter especially through the use of housing vouchers 
homeownership is an important goal but public policy must be balanced to reflect the needs of americans who choose to rent 
a comprehensive housing policy should address the demand for apartments and multifamily housing 
any assistance should be subject to stringent oversight to ensure that funds are spent wisely 
americas infrastructure networks are critical for economic growth 
international competitiveness 
and national security 
infrastructure programs have traditionally been nonpartisan everyone recognized that we all need clean water and safe roads rail bridges ports and airports 
the current administration has changed that replacing civil engineering with social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit 
in the vaunted stimulus package less than six percent of the funds went to transportation 
with most of that to cosmetic shovelready projects rather than fundamental structural improvements 
all the while the democrats davisbacon law continues to drive up infrastructure construction and maintenance costs for the benefit of that partys union stalwarts 
what most americans take for grantedthe safety and availability of our water supplyis in perilous condition 
engineering surveys report crumbling drinking water systems aging dams and overwhelmed wastewater infrastructure 
investment in these areas as well as with levees and inland waterways can renew communities attract businesses and create jobs 
most importantly it can assure the health and safety of the american people 
the nations ports have become a bottleneck in international trade 
americas exporters sometimes use canadian ports in order to reach the world market in a timely manner 
with the widening of the panama canal our east coast and gulf ports have an extraordinary opportunity to boost container traffic 
but require major improvement to remain competitive receivers of large vessels 
interstate infrastructure has long been a federal responsibility shared with the states 
and a renewed federalstate partnership and new publicprivate partnerships are urgently needed to maintain and modernize our countrys travel lifelines 
to facilitate economic growth and job creation 
in the last two years congressional republicans have taken the lead with initiatives like the faa modernization and reform act the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act and the coast guard and maritime transportation act 
the recent highway bill reforming the federal highway program included some key reforms it will shorten the project approval process 
eliminate unnecessary programs 
and give states more flexibility to address their particular needs 
it is a return to the principles of federalism and it contains not a single earmark 
it should be followed by reform of the year old national environmental policy act to create regulatory certainty for infrastructure projects expedite their timetables and limit litigation against them 
securing sufficient funding for the highway trust fund remains a challenge given the debt and deficits and the need to reduce spending 
republicans will make hard choices and set priorities and infrastructure will be among them 
in some states with elected officials dominated by the democratic party a proportion of highway funds is diverted to other purposes 
this must stop 
we oppose any funding mechanism that would involve governmental monitoring of every car and truck in the nation 
amtrak continues to be for the taxpayers an extremely expensive railroad 
the public has to subsidize every ticket nearly 
it is long past time for the federal government to get out of way and allow private ventures to provide passenger service to the northeast corridor 
the same holds true with regard to highspeed and intercity rail across the country 
international trade is crucial for our economy 
it means more american jobs 
higher wages 
and a better standard of living 
every billion in additional us exports means another jobs here at home 
the free trade agreements negotiated with friendly democracies since president reagans trailblazing pact with israel in facilitated the creation of nearly ten million jobs supported by our exports 
that record makes all the more deplorable the current administrations slowness in completing agreements begun by its predecessor 
and its failure to pursue any new trade agreements with friendly nations 
this worldwide explosion of trade has had a downside however as some governments have used a variety of unfair means to limit american access to their markets 
while stealing our designs patents brands knowhow and technologythe intellectual property that drives innovation 
the chief offender is china which has built up its economy in part by piggybacking onto western technological advances 
manipulates its currency to the disadvantage of american exporters 
excludes american products from government purchases subsidizes chinese companies to give them a commercial advantage 
and invents regulations and standards designed to keep out foreign competition 
the current administrations way of dealing with all these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender 
thus a republican president will insist on full parity in trade with china 
and stand ready to impose countervailing duties if china fails to amend its currency policies 
commercial discrimination will be met in kind 
counterfeit goods will be aggressively kept out of the country 
victimized private firms will be encouraged to raise claims in both us courts and at the world trade organization 
punitive measures will be imposed on foreign firms that misappropriate american technology and intellectual property 
until china abides by the wtos government procurement agreement the united states government will end procurement of chinese goods and services 
because american workers have shown that on a truly level playing field they can surpass the competition in international trade we call for the restoration of presidential trade promotion authority 
it will ensure up or down votes in congress on any new trade agreements 
without meddling by special interests 
a republican president will complete negotiations for a transpacific partnership to open rapidly developing asian markets to us products 
beyond that we envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets what has been called a reagan economic zone 
in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned 
the greatest asset of the american economy is the hardworking american 
the high rates of unemployment over the last three and a half years disastrously high among youth minorities and veteranshave thus been a tragic waste of energy and ideas 
compounded by the waste of billions in stimulus funds with no payoff in jobs 
the chief cause has been an unprecedented uncertainty in the american free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration 
nothing matters more than getting the american people back to work 
in addition to cutting spending 
keeping taxes low 
and curtailing bureaucratic red tape 
we must replace outdated policies and ineffectual training programs with a plan to develop a twentyfirst century workforce to make the most of our countrys human capital 
it is critical that the united states has a highly trained and skilled workforce 
nine federal agencies currently run retraining programs at a total cost of billion annually with dismal results 
both the trainees in those programs and the taxpayers who fund them deserve better 
we propose consolidation of those programs into state block grants 
so that training can be coordinated with local schools and employers 
that will be critically important if states establish personal reemployment accounts letting trainees direct resources in ways that will steer them toward longterm employment 
especially through onthejob training with participating employers 
we can accelerate the process of restoring our domestic economyand reclaiming this countrys traditional position of dominance in international tradeby a policy of strategic immigration 
granting more work visas to holders of advanced degrees in science technology engineering and math from other nations 
highly educated immigrants can assist in creating new services and products 
in the same way foreign students who graduate from an american university with an advanced degree in science technology engineering or math should be encouraged to remain here and contribute to economic prosperity and job creation 
highly skilled englishspeaking and integrated into their communities they are too valuable a resource to lose 
as in past generations we should encourage the worlds innovators and inventors to create our common future and their permanent homes here in the united states 
republicans believe that the employer employee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment and workplace flexibility 
which is why republicans support employee ownership 
we believe employee stock ownership plans create capitalists and expand the ownership of private property 
and are therefore the essence of a highperforming free enterprise economy 
which creates opportunity for those who work and honors those values that have made our nation so strong 
todays workforce is independent 
wants flexibility in working conditions 
needs familyfriendly options 
and is most productive when allowed to innovate and rethink the status quo 
the federal government should set an example in making those adaptations especially in promoting portability in pension plans and health insurance 
the current administration has chosen a different path with regard to labor clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the washington offices of union elites 
it has strongly supported the antibusiness card check legislation to deny workers a secret ballot in union organizing campaigns 
and through the use of project labor agreements barred percent of the construction workforce from competing for jobs in many stimulus projects 
the current administration has turned the national labor relations board into a partisan advocate for big labor 
using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses 
and through snap elections and micro unions limit the rights of workers and employers alike 
we will restore the rule of law to labor law by blocking card check 
enacting the secret ballot protection act 
enforcing the hobbs act against labor violence 
and passing the raise act to allow all workers to receive wellearned raises without the approval of their union representative 
we demand an end to the project labor agreements 
and we call for repeal of the davisbacon act which costs the taxpayers billions of dollars annually in artificially high wages on government projects 
we support the right of states to enact righttowork laws 
and encourage them to do so to promote greater economic liberty 
ultimately we support the enactment of a national righttowork law to promote worker freedom 
and to promote greater economic liberty 
we will aggressively enforce the recent decision by the supreme court barring the use of union dues for political purposes without the consent of the worker 
we salute the republican governors and state legislators who have saved their states from fiscal disaster by reforming their laws governing public employee unions 
we urge elected officials across the country to follow their lead in order to avoid state and local defaults on their obligations and the collapse of services to the public 
to safeguard the free choice of public employees no government at any level should act as the dues collector for unions 
a republican president will protect the rights of conscience of public employees by proposing legislation to bar mandatory dues for political purposes 
we are the party of the constitution 
the solemn compact which confirms our godgiven individual rights 
and assures that all americans stand equal before the law 
perhaps the greatest political document ever written it defines the purposes and limits of government 
and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that makes the us the worlds freest most stable and most prosperous nation 
its constitutional ideals have been emulated around the world 
and with them has come unprecedented prosperity for billions of people 
in the spirit of the constitution we consider discrimination based on sex race age religion creed disability or national origin unacceptable and immoral 
we will strongly enforce antidiscrimination statutes 
and ask all to join us in rejecting the forces of hatred and bigotry and in denouncing all who practice or promote racism antisemitism ethnic prejudice or religious intolerance 
we support efforts to help lowincome individuals get a fair chance based on their potential and individual merit 
in a free society the primary role of government is to protect the godgiven inalienable inherent rights of its citizens including the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
the republican party includes americans from every faith and tradition 
and our policies and positions respect the right of every american to follow his or her beliefs 
and underscore our reverence for the religious freedom envisioned by the founding fathers of our nation and of our party 
as a matter of principle we oppose the creation of any new racebased governments within the united states 
we salute republican members of the house of representatives for enshrining in the rules of the house the requirement that every bill must cite the provision of the constitution which permits its introduction 
their adherence to the constitution stands in stark contrast to the antipathy toward the constitution demonstrated by the current administration and its senate allies by appointing czars to evade the confirmation process 
making unlawful recess appointments when the senate is not in recess 
using executive orders to bypass the separation of powers and its checks and balances 
encouraging illegal actions by regulatory agencies from the nlrb to the epa 
openly and notoriously displaying contempt for congress the judiciary 
and the constitutional prerogatives of the individual states 
refusing to defend the nations laws in federal courts or enforce them on the streets 
ignoring the legal requirement for legislative enactment of an annual budget 
gutting welfare reform by unilaterally removing its statutory work requirement 
buying senatorial votes with special favors 
and evading the legal requirement for congressional consultation regarding troop commitments overseas 
a republican president and republican senate will join house republicans in living by the rule of law the foundation of the american republic 
protecting america is the first and most important duty of our federal government 
the constitution wisely distributes important roles in the area of national security to both the president and congress 
it empowers the president to serve as commander in chief making him the lead instrument of the american people in matters of national security and foreign affairs 
it also bestows authority on congress including the powers to declare war regulate commerce and authorize the funds needed to keep and protect our nation 
the united states of america is strongest when the president and congress work closely togetherin war and in peaceto advance our common interests and ideals 
by uniting our government and our citizens our foreign policy will secure freedom 
keep america safe 
and ensure that we remain the last best hope on earth 
a blatant example has been the courtordered redefinition of marriage in several states 
this is more than a matter of warring legal concepts and ideals 
it is an assault on the foundations of our society challenging the institution which for thousands of years in virtually every civilization has been entrusted with the rearing of children and the transmission of cultural values 
that is why congressional republicans took the lead in enacting the defense of marriage act 
affirming the right of states and the federal government not to recognize samesex relationships licensed in other jurisdictions 
the current administrations open defiance of this constitutional principlein its handling of immigration cases in federal personnel benefits in allowing a samesex marriage at a military base and in refusing to defend doma in the courts makes a mockery of the presidents inaugural oath 
we commend the united states house of representatives and state attorneys general who have defended these laws when they have been attacked in the courts 
we reaffirm our support for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman 
we applaud the citizens of the majority of states which have enshrined in their constitutions the traditional concept of marriage 
and we support the campaigns underway in several other states to do so 
republican members of congress have repeatedly tried to reform the budget process to make it more transparent and accountable 
in particular by voting for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution 
following the lead of states which have put that restraint into their own constitutions 
we call for a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority for any tax increase with exceptions for only war and national emergencies 
and imposing a cap limiting spending to the historical average percentage of gdp so that future congresses can not balance the budget by raising taxes 
we support the review and examination of all federal agencies to eliminate wasteful spending operational inefficiencies or abuse of power to determine whether they are performing functions that are better performed by the states 
these functions as appropriate should be returned to the states in accordance with the tenth amendment of the united states constitution 
we affirm that all legislation rules and regulations must conform and public servants must adhere to the us constitution as originally intended by the framers 
whether such legislation is a state or federal matter must be determined in accordance with the tenth amendment in conjunction with article i section 
when the constitution is evaded transgressed or ignored so are the freedoms it guarantees 
stands for the rights of individuals families faith communities institutions – 
and of the states which are their instruments of selfgovernment 
in establishing a federal system of government the framers viewed the states as laboratories of democracy and centers of innovation as do we 
to maintain the integrity of their system they bequeathed to successive generations an instrument by which we might correct any misalignment of power between our states and the federal government the tenth amendment 
the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people 
in fidelity to that principle we condemn the current administrations continued assaults on state governments in matters ranging from voter id laws to immigration from healthcare programs to land use decisions 
our states are the laboratories of democracy from which the people propel our nation forward 
solving local and state problems through local and state innovations 
we pledge to restore the proper balance between the federal government and the governments closest to and most reflective of the american people 
scores of entrenched federal programs violate the constitutional mandates of federalism by taking money from the states laundering it through various federal agencies only to return to the states shrunken grants with mandates attached 
we propose wherever feasible to leave resources where they originate in the homes and neighborhoods of the taxpayers 
we call on the federal government to do a systematic analysis of laws and regulations to eliminate costly bureaucratic mandates on the states and the people 
a few states and their political subdivisions are currently in dire fiscal situations largely because of their spending debt and failure to rein in public employee unions 
in the event those conditions worsen the federal government must not assume the state governments or their political subdivisions financial responsibility 
or require the nations taxpayers to pay for the misrule of a few state governments 
nor shall the states assume the federal governments financial responsibility 
we oppose the national popular vote interstate compact or any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the electoral college 
we recognize that an unconstitutional effort to impose national popular vote would be a mortal threat to our federal system 
and a guarantee of corruption as every ballot box in every state would become a chance to steal the presidency 
honest elections are the foundation of representative government 
we support state efforts to ensure ballot access for the elderly the handicapped military personnel and all authorized voters 
voter fraud is political poison 
it strikes at the heart of representative government 
we call on every citizen elected official and member of the judiciary to preserve the integrity of the vote 
we call for vigorous prosecution of voter fraud at the state and federal level 
to do less disenfranchises present and future generations 
when all parties have representatives observing the counting of ballots in a transparent process integrity is assured 
we strongly support the policy that all electronic voting systems have a voter verified paper audit trail 
states or political subdivisions that use allmail elections can not ensure the integrity of the ballot 
when ballots are mailed to every registered voter ballots can be stolen or fraudulently voted by unauthorized individuals because the system does not have a way to verify the identity of the voter 
military men and women must not be disenfranchised from the very freedom they defend 
we affirm that our troops wherever stationed be allowed to vote 
and those votes be counted in the november election and in all elections 
to that end the entire chain of command from president and the secretary of defense to base and unit commandersmust ensure the timely receipt and return of all ballots and the utilization of electronic delivery of ballots where allowed by state law 
we support changing the way that the decennial census is conducted 
so that citizens are distinguished from lawfully present aliens and illegal aliens 
in order to preserve the principle of oneperson onevote the apportionment of representatives among the states should be according to the number of citizens 
the first provision of the first amendment concerns freedom of religion 
that guarantee reflected thomas jeffersons virginia statute for religious freedom which declared that no one should suffer on account of his religious opinion or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinion in matters of religion… 
that assurance has never been more needed than it is today as liberal elites try to drive religious beliefs and religious believersout of the public square 
the most offensive instance of this war on religion has been the current administrations attempt to compel faithrelated institutions as well as believing individuals to contravene their deeply held religious moral or ethical beliefs regarding health services traditional marriage or abortion 
this forcible secularization of religious and religiously affiliated organizations including faithbased hospitals and colleges has been in tandem with the current administrations audacity in declaring which faithrelated activities are or are not protected by the first amendmentan unprecedented aggression repudiated by a unanimous supreme court in its hosannatabor v eeoc decision 
we pledge to respect the religious beliefs and rights of conscience of all americans 
and to safeguard the independence of their institutions from government 
we support the public display of the ten commandments as a reflection of our history and of our countrys judeochristian heritage 
and we affirm the right of students to engage in prayer at public school events in public schools 
and to have equal access to public schools and other public facilities to accommodate religious freedom in the public square 
we assert every citizens right to apply religious values to public policy and the right of faithbased organizations to participate fully in public programs without renouncing their beliefs removing religious symbols or submitting to governmentimposed hiring practices 
we oppose government discrimination against businesses due to religious views 
we support the first amendment right of freedom of association of the boy scouts of america and other service organizations whose values are under assault 
and condemn the state blacklisting of religious groups which decline to arrange adoptions by samesex couples 
we condemn the hate campaigns threats of violence and vandalism by proponents of samesex marriage against advocates of traditional marriage 
and call for a federal investigation into attempts to deny religious believers their civil rights 
the rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box 
they include the free speech right to devote ones resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports 
we oppose any restrictions or conditions that would discourage americans from exercising their constitutional right to enter the political fray 
or limit their commitment to their ideals 
and oppose passage of the disclose act or any similar legislation designed to vitiate the supreme courts recent decisions protecting political speech in wisconsin right to life v federal election commission and citizens united v federal election commission 
we insist that there should be no regulation of political speech on the internet 
by the same token we oppose governmental censorship of speech through the socalled fairness doctrine or by government enforcement of speech codes free speech zones or other forms of political correctness on campus 
a right which antedated the constitution and was solemnly confirmed by the second amendment 
we acknowledge support and defend the lawabiding citizens godgiven right of selfdefense 
we support the fundamental right to selfdefense wherever a lawabiding citizen has a legal right to be 
and we support federal legislation that would expand the exercise of that right by allowing those with stateissued carry permits to carry firearms in any state that issues such permits to its own residents 
gun ownership is responsible citizenship enabling americans to defend their homes and communities 
we oppose legislation that is intended to restrict our second amendment rights by limiting the capacity of clips or magazines or otherwise restoring the illconsidered clinton gun ban 
affirming the right of the people to be secure in their houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
we support pending legislation to prevent unwarranted or unreasonable governmental intrusion through the use of aerial surveillance or flyovers on us soil with the exception of patrolling our national borders 
all security measures and police actions should be viewed through the lens of the fourth amendment 
the takings clause of the fifth amendment– nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation–is a bulwark against tyranny 
for without property rights individual rights are diminished 
that is why we deplore the supreme courts kelo v new london decision allowing local governments to seize a persons home or land not for vital public use but for transfer to private developers 
we call on state legislatures to moot the impact of the kelo decision in their states by appropriate legislation or constitutional amendments 
equally important we pledge to enforce the takings clause in the actions of federal agencies to ensure just compensation whenever private property is needed to achieve a compelling public use 
this includes the taking of property in the form of water rights in the west and elsewhere 
and the taking of property by environmental regulations that destroy its value 
this speaks most eloquently for itself the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people 
this provision codifies the concept that our government derives its power from the people 
and we therefore celebrate the grassroots rediscovery of this and other constitutional guarantees over the last four years 
and welcome to our ranks all our fellow citizens who are determined to reclaim the rights of the people that have been ignored or violated by government 
faithful to the selfevident truths enshrined in the declaration of independence we assert the sanctity of human life 
and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed 
we support a human life amendment to the constitution 
and endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children 
we oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion or fund organizations which perform or advocate it 
and will not fund or subsidize health care which includes abortion coverage 
we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life 
we oppose the nonconsensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment including food and water from people with disabilities including newborns as well as the elderly and infirm 
just as we oppose active and passive euthanasia and assisted suicide 
republican leadership has led the effort to prohibit the barbaric practice of partialbirth abortion 
and permitted states to extend health care coverage to children before birth 
we urge congress to strengthen the born alive infant protection act by enacting appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion including early induction delivery where the death of the infant is intended 
we call for legislation to ban sexselective abortions 
– gender discrimination in its most lethal form 
and to protect from abortion unborn children who are capable of feeling pain 
and we applaud us house republicans for leading the effort to protect the lives of paincapable unborn children in the district of columbia 
we call for a ban on the use of body parts from aborted fetuses for research 
we support and applaud adult stem cell research to develop lifesaving therapies 
and we oppose the killing of embryos for their stem cells 
we oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research 
we also salute the many states that have passed laws for informed consent 
mandatory waiting periods prior to an abortion 
and healthprotective clinic regulation 
we seek to protect young girls from exploitation through a parental consent requirement 
and we affirm our moral obligation to assist rather than penalize women challenged by an unplanned pregnancy 
we salute those who provide them with counseling and adoption alternatives and empower them to choose life 
and we take comfort in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed republican legislative initiatives 
the symbol of our constitutional unity to which we all pledge allegiance is the flag of the united states of america 
by whatever legislative method is most feasible old glory should be given legal protection against desecration 
we condemn decisions by activist judges to deny children the opportunity to say the pledge of allegiance in its entirety including under god in public schools and encourage states to promote the pledge 
we condemn the actions of those who deny our children the means by which to show respect for our great country and the constitutional principles represented by our flag 
subjecting american citizens to foreign laws is inimical to the spirit of the constitution 
it is one reason we oppose us participation in the international criminal court 
there must be no use of foreign law by us courts in interpreting our constitution and laws 
nor should foreign sources of law be used in state courts adjudication of criminal or civil matters 
this unreasonable extension of the act not only hurts american businesses and american jobs 
but also subordinates our own rule of law to the legal codes of other governments 
just as george washington wisely warned america to avoid foreign entanglements and enter into only temporary alliances we oppose the adoption or ratification of international treaties that weaken or encroach upon american sovereignty 
we are the party of sustainable jobs and economic growth – through american energy agriculture and environmental policy 
we are also the party of americas growers and producers farmers ranchers foresters miners 
and all those who bring from the earth the minerals and energy that are the lifeblood of our nations historically strong economy 
we are as well the party of traditional conservation the wise development of resources that keeps in mind both the sacrifices of past generations to secure that bounty 
and our responsibility to preserve it for future generations 
the republican party is committed to domestic energy independence 
the united states and its neighbors to the north and south have been blessed with abundant energy resources tapped and untapped traditional and alternative that are among the largest and most valuable on earth 
advancing technology has given us a more accurate understanding of the nations enormous reserves that are ours for the development 
the role of public officials must be to encourage responsible development across the board 
unlike the current administration we will not pick winners and losers in the energy marketplace 
instead we will let the free market and the publics preferences determine the industry outcomes 
in assessing the various sources of potential energy republicans advocate an alloftheabove diversified approach taking advantage of all our american godgiven resources 
that is the best way to advance north american energy independence 
our policies aim at energy security to ensure an affordable stable and reliable energy supply for all parts of the country and all sectors of the economy 
energy security is intimately linked to national security both in terms of our current dependence upon foreign supplies 
and because some of the hundreds of billions of dollars we pay for foreign oil ends up in the hands of terrorist groups that wish to harm us 
a growing prosperous economy and our standard of living and quality of life moreover depend on affordable and abundant domestic energy supplies 
a strong and stable energy sector is a job generator 
and a catalyst of economic growth 
not only in the laborintensive energy industry but also in its secondary markets 
the republican party will encourage and ensure diversified domestic sources of energy from research and development exploration production transportation transmission and consumption in a way that is economically viable and jobproducing 
as well as environmentally sound 
when our energy industry is revitalized millions more americans will find work in manufacturing food production metals minerals packaging transportation and other fields – because of the jobs that will be created in and as a result of the energy sector we are determined to create jobs 
spur economic growth 
lower energy prices 
and strengthen our energy industry 
we look toward the private sectors development of new stateoftheart coalfired plants that will be lowcost environmentally responsible and efficient 
we also encourage research and development of advanced technologies in this sector including coaltoliquid coal gasification and related technologies for enhanced oil recovery 
the current administrationwith a president who publicly threatened to bankrupt anyone who builds a coalpowered plantseems determined to shut down coal production in the united states 
even though there is no costeffective substitute for it or for the hundreds of thousands of jobs that go with it as the nations largest source of electricity generation 
and encourage the increased safe development in all regions of the nations coal resources 
the jobs it produces 
and the affordable reliable energy that it provides for america 
further we oppose any and all cap and trade legislation 
all estimates of americas oil and natural gas reserves indicate an incredible bounty for the use of many generations to come 
at a time when unemployment has been above percent for consecutive months the longest stretch since the great depression and some million americans are either unemployed underemployed or have given up on finding work we should be pursuing our oil and gas resources both on and offshore 
it is nonsensical to spurn real job creation by putting almost all of our coastal waters off limits to energy exploration while urging other nations to explore their coasts 
we call for a reasoned approach to all offshore energy development on the east coast and other appropriate waters 
and support the right of states to a reasonable share of the resulting revenue and royalties 
we support opening the outer continental shelf ocs for energy exploration and development and ending the current administrations moratorium on permitting 
opening the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr for exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
and allowing for more oil and natural gas exploration on federally owned and controlled land 
we support this development in accordance with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations 
the current president personally blocked one of the most important energy and jobs projects in years 
the keystone xl pipelinewhich would have brought much needed canadian and american oil to us refinerieswould create thousands of jobs 
the current presidents jobkilling combination of extremism and ineptitude threatens to create a permanent energy shortage 
we are committed to approving the keystone xl pipeline and to streamlining permitting for the development of other oil and natural gas pipelines 
nuclear energy now generating about percent of our electricity through power plants must be expanded 
no new nuclear generating plants have been licensed and constructed for thirty years 
we call for timely processing of new reactor applications currently pending at the nuclear regulatory commission 
the federal governments failure to address the storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel has left huge bills for states and taxpayers 
our country needs a more proactive approach to managing spent nuclear fuel including through developing advanced reprocessing technologies 
we encourage the costeffective development of renewable energy 
but the taxpayers should not serve as venture capitalists for risky endeavors 
it is important to create a pathway toward a marketbased approach for renewable energy sources 
and to aggressively develop alternative sources for electricity generation such as wind hydro solar biomass geothermal and tidal energy 
partnerships between traditional energy industries and emerging renewable industries can be a central component in meeting the nations longterm needs 
alternative forms of energy are part of our action agenda to power the homes and workplaces of the nation 
the current administration has used taxpayer dollars to pick winners and losers in the energy sector while publicly threatening to bankrupt anyone who builds a new coalfired plant and has stopped the keystone xl pipeline 
the current president has done nothing to disavow the scare campaign against hydraulic fracturing 
furthermore he has wasted billions of taxpayers dollars by subsidizing favored companies like solyndra which generated bankruptcies rather than kilowatts 
since the current president took office in consumers pay approximately twice as much for gas at the pump 
our common theme is to promote development of all forms of energy 
enable consumer choice to keep energy costs low 
and ensure that america remains competitive in the global marketplace 
we will respect the states proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing 
continue development of oil and gas resources in places like the bakken formation and marcellus shale 
and review the environmental laws that often thwart new energy exploration and production 
we salute the republican members of the house of representatives for passing the domestic energy and jobs act a vital piece of progrowth legislation now introduced by republicans in the senate 
agricultural production and agricultural exports are a fundamental part of the us economy 
and the vigor of us agriculture is central to our agenda for jobs growth and prosperity 
our farmers and ranchers are responsible for millions of jobs 
and for generating a trade surplus of more than billion annually 
our producers provide america with abundant food export food to hungry people around the world and create a positive trade balance 
because of their care for the land the united states does not depend on foreign imports for sustenance the way we depend on others for much of our energy 
however americans are concerned about the increasing cost of their food under the current administration policies that restrict energy production 
and raise costs for producers due to increased regulation 
our dependence on foreign imports of fertilizer could threaten our food supply 
and we support the development of domestic production of fertilizer 
the success of our system of risk management policies will enable farmers and ranchers to continue to feed and fuel the nation and much of the world 
uncertainty is threatening the survival of our nations farmers 
americas growers and farmers are aging and much of americas farmland will be passed to the next generation of farmers with families 
uncertainties in estate and capital gains tax laws threaten the survival of multigenerational family farms 
the proposals for tax reforms contained elsewhere in this document will make certain that family farms will not be lost 
agricultural producers and the jobs they generate throughout the entire food chain must confront volatility in both the weather and the markets 
we support farm programs that enable them to manage the extraordinary risk they meet in the fields every year 
these programs should be as costeffective as they are functional 
offering risk management tools that improve producers ability to operate when times are tough 
just as all other federal programs must contribute to the deficit reduction necessary to put our country back on a sound fiscal footing so must farm programs contribute to balancing the budget 
programs like the direct payment program should end in favor of those like crop insurance that help manage risk and are countercyclical in nature 
we support the historic role of the usda in agricultural research that has transformed farming here and around the world 
because food safety is a major concern of the american people we urge congress to ensure adequate resources for the departments responsibilities in that regard 
the forest service should be charged to use these resources to the best economic potential for the nation 
in order to secure one of the countrys most important natural resources we will review the way the forest service handles wildfires 
this summers lack of rainfall over much of agricultural america highlights the importance of access to water for farmers and ranchers alike 
we stand with growers and producers in defense of their water rights against attempts by the epa and the army corps of engineers to expand jurisdiction over water including water that is clearly not navigable 
the productivity of americas farmers makes possible the generosity of us food aid efforts around the world 
these programs are fragmented between the department of agriculture and the us agency for international development 
they should be streamlined into one agency with a concentration on reducing overhead to maximize delivery of the actual goods 
the food stamp program now accounts for nearly percent of the entire usda budget 
in finding ways to fight fraud and abuse the congress should consider blockgranting that program to the states along with the other domestic nutrition programs 
the environment is getting cleaner and healthier 
the nations air and waterways as a whole are much healthier than they were just a few decades ago 
efforts to reduce pollution encourage recycling educate the public and avoid ecological degradation have been a success 
a shift from a jobkilling punitive mentality 
an important factor is full transparency in development of the data and modeling that drive regulations 
legislation to restore the authority of states in environmental protection is essential 
we encourage the use of agricultural best management practices among the states to reduce pollution 
conservation is a conservative value 
as the pioneer of conservation over a century ago the republican party believes in the moral obligation of the people to be good stewards of the godgiven natural beauty and resources of our country 
a policy protecting these objectives however must balance economic development and private property rights in the short run with conservation goals over the long run 
also public access to public lands for recreational activities such as hunting fishing and recreational shooting should be permitted on all appropriate federal lands 
moreover the advance of science and technology advances environmentalism as well 
science allows us to weigh the costs and benefits of a policy so that we can prudently deal with our resources 
this is especially important when the causes and longrange effects of a phenomenon are uncertain 
we must restore scientific integrity to our public research institutions 
and remove political incentives from publicly funded research 
experience has shown that in caring for the land and water private ownership has been our best guarantee of conscientious stewardship 
while the worst instances of environmental degradation have occurred under government control 
by the same token the most economically advanced countries–those that respect and protect private property rightsalso have the strongest environmental protections 
because their economic progress makes possible the conservation of natural resources 
in this context congress should reconsider whether parts of the federal governments enormous landholdings and control of water in the west could be better used for ranching mining or forestry through private ownership 
timber is a renewable natural resource 
which provides jobs to thousands of americans 
all efforts should be made to make federal lands managed by the us forest service available for harvesting 
the enduring truth is that people best protect what they own 
it makes sense that those closest to a situation are best able to determine its remedy 
that is why a site and situationspecific approach to an environmental problem is more likely to solve it instead of a national rule based on the ideological concerns of politicized central planning 
we therefore endorse legislation to require congressional approval before any rule projected to cost in excess of million to american consumers can go into effect 
the republican party supports appointing public officials to federal agencies who will properly and correctly apply environmental laws and regulations always in support of economic development job creation and american prosperity and leadership 
federal agencies charged with enforcing environmental laws must stop regulating beyond their authority 
there is no place in regulatory agencies for activist regulators 
since the epa has moved forward with expansive regulations that will impose tens of billions of dollars in new costs on american businesses and consumers 
many of these new rules are creating regulatory uncertainty preventing new projects from going forward discouraging new investment and stifling job creation 
including advance notice to all state and local governments tribes businesses landowners and the public who could be adversely affected 
we likewise support pending legislation to ensure cumulative analysis of epa regulations 
and to require full transparency in all epa decisions 
so that the public will know in advance their full impact on jobs and the economy 
we also call on congress to take quick action to prohibit the epa from moving forward with new greenhouse gas regulations that will harm the nations economy 
and threaten millions of jobs over the next quarter century 
we are the party of government reform 
at a time when the federal government has become bloated antiquated and unresponsive to taxpayers it is our intention not only to improve management and provide better services 
but also to rethink and restructure government to bring it into the twentyfirst century 
government reform requires constant vigilance and effort because government by its nature tends to expand in both size and scope 
our goal is not just less spending in washington 
but something far more important for the future of our nation protecting the constitutional rights of citizens 
sustainable prosperity 
and strengthening the american family 
we must do things in a dramatically different way by reversing the undermining of federalism and the centralizing of power in washington 
we look to the example set by republican governors and legislators all across the nation 
their leadership in reforming and reengineering government closest to the people vindicates the role of the states as the laboratories of democracy 
we look to governmentlocal state and federal for the things government must do but we believe those duties can be carried out more efficiently and at less cost 
for all other activities we look to the private sector for the american peoples resourcefulness productivity innovation fiscal responsibility and citizenleadership have always been the true foundation of our national greatness 
for much of the last century an opposing view has dominated public policy where we have witnessed the expansion centralization and bureaucracy in an entitlement society 
government has lumbered on stifling innovation with no incentive for fundamental change through antiquated programs begun generations ago and now illsuited to present needs and future requirements 
as a result todays taxpayersand future generationsface massive indebtedness 
while congressional democrats and the current administration block every attempt to turn things around 
this manmade logjamthe socalled stalemate in washingtonparticularly affects the governments three largest programs which have become central to the lives of untold millions of americans medicare medicaid and social security 
the republican party is committed to saving medicare and medicaid 
unless the programs fiscal ship is righted the individuals hurt the first and the worst will be those who depend on them the most 
we will save medicare by modernizing it 
by empowering its participants 
and by putting it on a secure financial footing 
we welcome to the effort all who sincerely want to ensure the future for our seniors 
and the poor 
republicans are determined to achieve that goal with a candid and honest presentation of the problem and its solutions to the american people 
despite the enormous differences between medicare and medicaid the two programs share the same fiscal outlook their current courses can not be sustained 
medicare has grown from more than million enrolled in to more than million enrolled today with a projected total of million in 
medicaid counted almost million enrollees in has about million now and under obamacare would include an additional million 
medicare spent more than billion in andhas close to trillion in unfunded obligations 
while total medicaid spending will more than doubleby 
in many states medicaids mandates andinflexible bureaucracy have become a budgetaryblack hole growing faster than most other budgetlines and devouring funding for many other essentialgovernmental functions 
poor quality healthcare is the most expensive type of care because it prolongs affliction and leads to ever more complications 
even expensive prevention is preferable to more costly treatment later on 
when approximately percent of healthcare costs are related to lifestyle –smoking obesity substance abuse–far greater emphasis has to be put upon personal responsibility for health maintenance 
our goal for both medicare and medicaid must be to assure that every participant receives the amount of care they need at the time they need it 
whether for an expectant mother and her baby or for someone in the last moments of life 
absent reforms these two programs are headed for bankruptcy that will endanger care for seniors and the poor 
the first step is to move the two programs away from their current unsustainable defined benefit entitlement model to a fiscally sound defined contribution model 
this is the only way to limit costs and restore consumer choice for patients and introduce competition 
for in healthcare as in any other sector of the economy genuine competition is the best guarantee of better care at lower cost 
it is also the best guard against the fraud and abuse that have plagued medicare in its isolation from free market forces which in turn costs the taxpayers billions of dollars every year 
we can do this without making any changes for those and older 
while retaining the option of traditional medicare in competition with private plans we call for a transition to a premiumsupport model for medicare with an incomeadjusted contribution toward a health plan of the enrollees choice 
this model will include private health insurance plans that provide catastrophic protection to ensure the continuation of doctorpatient relationships 
without disadvantaging retirees or those nearing retirement the age eligibility for medicare must be made more realistic in terms of todays longer life span 
medicaid as the dominant payer in the health market in regards to longterm care births and individuals with mental illness is the next frontier of welfare reform 
it is simply too big and too flawed to be managed in its current condition from washington 
republican governors have taken the lead in proposing a host of regulatory changes that could make the program more flexible innovative and accountable 
there should be alternatives to hospitalization for chronic health problems 
patients could be rewarded for participating in disease prevention activities 
excessive mandates on coverage should be eliminated 
patients with longterm care needs might fare better in a separately designed program 
as those and other specific proposals show republican governors and state legislatures are ready to do the hard work of modernizing medicaid for the twentyfirst century 
we propose to let them do all that and more by blockgranting the program to the states providing the states with the flexibility to design programs that meet the needs of their low income citizens 
such reforms could be achieved through premium supports or a refundable tax credit 
allowing nondisabled adults and children to be moved into private health insurance of their choice where their needs can be met on the same basis as those of more affluent americans 
for the aged and disabled under medicaid for whom monthly costs can be extremely high states would have flexibility to improve the quality of care 
and to avoid the inappropriate institutional placing of patients who prefer to be cared for at home 
while no changes should adversely affect any current or nearretiree comprehensive reform should address our societys remarkable medical advances in longevity 
and allow younger workers the option of creating their own personal investment accounts as supplements to the system 
younger americans have lost all faith in the social security system which is understandable when they read the nonpartisan actuarys reports about its future funding status 
born in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most americans it is long overdue for major change not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning 
to restore public trust in the system republicans are committed to setting it on a sound fiscal basis that will give workers control over and a sound return on their investments 
the sooner we act the sooner those close to retirement can be reassured of their benefits 
and younger workers can take responsibility for planning their own retirement decades from now 
while pension law may be complicated the current bottom line is that many plans are increasingly underfunded by overestimating their rates of return on investments 
this in turn endangers the integrity of the pension guaranty benefit corporation which is itself seriously underfunded 
in both cases the taxpayers will be expected to pay for a bailout 
as the first step toward possible corrective action we call for a presidential panel to review the private pension system in this country of only those private pensions that are backed by the pension guaranty benefit corporation and to make public its findings 
the situation of public pension systems demands immediate remedial action 
the irresponsible promises of politicians at every level of government have come back to haunt todays taxpayers with enormous unfunded pension liabilities 
many cities face bankruptcy because of excessive outlays for early retirement extravagant health plans and overly generous pension benefits 
we salute the republican governors and state legislators who have in the face of abuse and threats of violence reformed their state pension systems for the benefit of both taxpayers and retirees alike 
the proper purpose of regulation is to set forth clear rules of the road for the citizens so that business owners and workers can understand in advance what they need to do or not do to augment the possibilities for success within the confines of the law 
regulations must be drafted and implemented to balance legitimate public safety or consumer protection goals and job creation 
constructive regulation should be a helpful guide not a punitive threat 
worst of all overregulation is a stealth tax on everyone as the costs of compliance with the whims of federal agencies are passed along to the consumers at the cost of trillion a year 
many regulations are necessary like those which ensure the safety of food and medicine especially from overseas 
but no peril justifies the regulatory impact of obamacare on the practice of medicine 
the doddfrank act on financial services 
or the epas and oshas overreaching regulation agenda 
a republican congress and president will repeal the first and second and rein in the third 
we support a sunset requirement to force reconsideration of outofdate regulations 
the bottom line on regulations is jobs 
in listening to america one constant we have heard is the jobcrippling effect of even wellintentioned regulation 
that makes it all the more important for federal agencies to be judicious about the impositions they create on businesses especially small businesses 
we call for a moratorium on the development of any new major and costly regulations until a republican administration reviews existing rules to ensure that they have a sound basis in science and will be costeffective 
the internet has unleashed innovation enabled growth and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history 
its independence is its power 
the internet offers a communications system uniquely free from government intervention 
we will remove regulatory barriers that protect outdated technologies and business plans from innovation and competition 
while preventing legacy regulation from interfering with new and disruptive technologies such as mobile delivery of voice video data as they become crucial components of the internet ecosystem 
we will resist any effort to shift control away from the successful multistakeholder approach of internet governance and toward governance by international or other intergovernmental organizations 
we will ensure that personal data receives full constitutional protection from government overreach 
and that individuals retain the right to control the use of their data by third parties 
the only way to safeguard or improve these systems is through the private sector 
the most vibrant sector of the american economy indeed onesixth of it is regulated by the federal government on precedents from the nineteenth century 
indeed the development of telecommunications advances so rapidly that even the telecom act of is woefully out of date 
an industry that invested billion in alone needs and deserves a more modern relationship with the federal government for the benefit of consumers here and worldwide 
the current administration has been frozen in the past 
it has conducted no auction of spectrum 
has offered no incentives for investment 
and through the fccs net neutrality rule is trying to micromanage telecom as if it were a railroad network 
it inherited from the previous republican administration percent coverage of the nation with broadband 
it will leave office with no progress toward the goal of universal coverage – after spending billion more 
that hurts rural america where farmers ranchers and small business manufacturers need connectivity to expand their customer base and operate in real time with the worlds producers 
we encourage publicprivate partnerships to provide predictable support for connecting rural areas so that every american can fully participate in the global economy 
we call for an inventory of federal agency spectrum to determine the surplus that could be auctioned for the taxpayers benefit 
with special recognition of the role university technology centers are playing in attracting private investment to the field we will replace the administrations luddite approach to technological progress with a regulatory partnership that will keep this country the world leader in technology and telecommunications 
for more than a century the us was the world leader in financial services 
the visionary management of capital was the lifeblood of the entire economy 
by giving responsible access to credit it helped small businesses grow 
created jobs 
and made americans the besthoused people in history 
by funding innovation financial services underwrote our future 
then came the financial collapse of and a critical reassessment of the role and condition of financial institutionsmost of which it must be said were responsible and healthy especially those closest to their investors and borrowers 
in cases of malfeasance or other criminal behavior the full force of the law should be used 
but in all cases this rule must apply no financial institution is too big to fail 
the taxpayers must never again be on the hook for the losses of fannie mae and freddie mac 
the public must never again be left holding the bag for wall street giants 
which is why we decry the current administrations record of overregulation and selective intervention 
which has already frozen investment and job creation 
and threatens to make financial institutions the coddled wards of government 
a far better approachprotecting consumers and taxpayers alikeis institutional transparency 
banks need to know that they could be at risk and investors need clear rules that are not subject to political meddling 
the same holds true for the equity market regulated by the securities and exchange commission 
we propose reasonable federal oversight of financial institutions 
practical safeguards for consumers 
and – what is crucial for this countrys economic rebound – sound spending tax and regulatory policies that will allow those institutions to once again become the builders of the next american century 
we strongly support tax reform 
in the event we do not achieve this we must preserve the mortgage interest deduction 
despite improvements as a result of republican nominations to the judiciary some judges in the federal courts remain far afield from their constitutional limitations 
the us constitution is the law of the land 
judicial activism which includes reliance on foreign law or unratified treaties undermines american law 
the sole solution apart from impeachment is the appointment of constitutionalist jurists who will interpret the law as it was originally intended rather than make it 
in addition to appointing activist judges the current administration has included an activist and highly partisan department of justice 
with a republican administration the department will stop suing states for exercising those powers reserved to the states 
will stop abusing its preclearance authority to block photoid voting laws 
and will fulfill its responsibility to defend all federal laws in court including the defense of marriage act 
the dire financial circumstances of the postal service require dramatic restructuring 
in a world of rapidly advancing telecommunications mail delivery from the era of the pony express can not long survive 
we call on congress to restructure the service to ensure the continuance of its essential function of delivering mail 
while preparing for the downsizing made inevitable by the advance of internet communication 
in light of the postal services seriously underfunded pension system congress should explore a greater role for private enterprise in appropriate aspects of the mailprocessing system 
while the aftermath of the terrorist attacks brought about a greater need for homeland security the american people have already delivered their verdict on the transportation security administration its procedures – and much of its personnel – need to be changed 
it is now a massive bureaucracy of employees who seem to be accountable to no one for the way they treat travelers 
we call for the private sector to take over airport screening wherever feasible 
and look toward the development of security systems that can replace the personal violation of frisking 
the greatest asset of the american economy is the american worker 
just as immigrant labor helped build our country in the past todays legal immigrants are making vital contributions in every aspect of our national life 
their industry and commitment to american values strengthens our economy 
enriches our culture 
and enables us to better understand and more effectively compete with the rest of the world 
illegal immigration undermines those benefits and affects us workers 
in an age of terrorism drug cartels human trafficking and criminal gangs the presence of millions of unidentified persons in this country poses grave risks to the safety and the sovereignty of the united states 
our highest priority therefore is to secure the rule of law both at our borders and at ports of entry 
we recognize that for most of those seeking entry into this country the lack of respect for the rule of law in their homelands has meant economic exploitation and political oppression by corrupt elites 
in this country the rule of law guarantees equal treatment to every individual including more than one million immigrants to whom we grant permanent residence every year 
that is why we oppose any form of amnesty for those who by intentionally violating the law disadvantage those who have obeyed it 
granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law breaking 
we support the mandatory use of the systematic alien verification for entitlements save programan internetbased system that verifies the lawful presence of applicantsprior to the granting of any state or federal government entitlements or irs refunds 
we insist upon enforcement at the workplace through verification systems so that jobs can be available to all legal workers 
use of the everify programan internetbased system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employeesmust be made mandatory nationwide 
state enforcement efforts in the workplace must be welcomed not attacked 
when americans need jobs it is absolutely essential that we protect them from illegal labor in the workplace 
in addition it is why we demand tough penalties for those who practice identity theft deal in fraudulent documents and traffic in human beings 
it is why we support republican legislation to give the department of homeland security longterm detention authority to keep dangerous but undeportable aliens off our streets 
expedite expulsion of criminal aliens 
and make gang membership a deportable offense 
the current administrations approach to immigration has undermined the rule of law at every turn 
it has lessened worksite enforcementand even allows the illegal aliens it does uncover to walk down the street to the next employer 
and challenged legitimate state efforts to keep communities safe suing them for trying to enforce the law when the federal government refuses to do so 
it has created a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law granting worker authorization to illegal aliens 
and shown little regard for the lifeanddeath situations facing the men and women of the border patrol 
perhaps worst of all the current administration has failed to enforce the legal means for workers or employers who want to operate within the law 
in contrast a republican administration and congress will partner with local governments through cooperative enforcement agreements in section g of the immigration and nationality act to make communities safer for all 
and will consider in light of both current needs and historic practice the utility of a legal and reliable source of foreign labor where needed through a new guest worker program 
we will create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily 
while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas 
state efforts to reduce illegal immigration must be encouraged not attacked 
the pending department of justice lawsuits against arizona alabama south carolina and utah must be dismissed immediately 
the doublelayered fencing on the border that was enacted by congress in but never completed must finally be built 
in order to restore the rule of law federal funding should be denied to sanctuary cities that violate federal law and endanger their own citizens 
and federal funding should be denied to universities that provide instate tuition rates to illegal aliens in open defiance of federal law 
we are grateful to the thousands of new immigrants many of them not yet citizens who are serving in the armed forces 
their patriotism should encourage us all to embrace the newcomers legally among us 
assist their journey to full citizenship 
and help their communities avoid isolation from the mainstream of society 
to that end while we encourage the retention and transmission of heritage tongues we support english as the nations official language 
a unifying force essential for the educational and economic advancement ofnot only immigrant communitiesbut also our nation as a whole 
based on both treaty and other law the federal government has a unique governmenttogovernment relationship with and trust responsibility for indian tribal governments and american indians and alaska natives 
these obligations have not been sufficiently honored 
the social and economic problems that plague indian country have grown worse over the last several decades we must reverse that trend 
ineffective federal programs deprive american indians of the services they need 
and longterm failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself 
american indians have established elected tribal governments to carry out the public policies of the tribe 
administer services to its tribal member constituents 
and manage relations with federal state and local governments 
we respect the tribal governments as the voice of their communities and encourage federal state and local governments to heed those voices in developing programs and partnerships to improve the quality of life for american indians and their neighbors in their communities 
republicans believe that economic selfsufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges confronting indian country 
we believe that tribal governments and their communities not washington bureaucracies are best situated to craft solutions that will end systemic problems that create poverty and disenfranchisement 
just as the federal government should not burden states with regulations 
it should not stifle the development of resources within the reservations 
which need federal assistance to advance their commerce nationally through roads and technology 
federal and state regulations that thwart job creation must be withdrawn or redrawn so that tribal governments acting on behalf of american indians are not disadvantaged 
it is especially egregious that the democratic party has persistently undermined tribal sovereignty in order to provide advantage to union bosses in the tribal workplace 
republicans recognize that each tribe has the right of consultation before any new regulatory policy is implemented on tribal land 
to the extent possible such consultation should take place in indian country with the tribal government and its members 
before promulgating and imposing any new laws or regulations affecting trust land or members the federal government should encourage indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives 
and should defer to tribes to develop their own standards or standards in conjunction with state governments 
republicans reject a onesizefitsall approach to federaltribalstate partnerships 
and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it 
better partnerships will help us to expand economic opportunity 
deliver topflight education to future generations 
modernize and improve the indian health service to make it more responsive to local needs 
and build essential infrastructure in indian country in cooperation with tribal neighbors 
our approach is to empower american indians through tribal selfdetermination and selfgovernance policies 
to develop their greatest assets human resources and the rich natural resources on their lands 
without undue federal interference 
like all americans american indians want safe communities for their families 
but inadequate resources and neglect have over time allowed criminal activities to plague indian country 
to protect everyoneand especially the most vulnerable children women and eldersthe legal system in tribal communities must provide stability and protect property rights 
everyones due process and civil rights must be safeguarded 
we support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by american indians including alaska natives and native hawaiians and 
to preserve their culture and languages that we consider to be national treasures 
lastly we recognize that american indians have responded to the call for military service in percentage numbers far greater than have other groups of americans 
we honor that commitment loyalty and sacrifice of all american indians serving in the military today and in years past 
and will ensure that all veterans and their families receive the care and respect they have earned through their loyal service to america 
congressional republicans have taken the lead in efforts to foster homeownership 
and open access to higher education for washington residents 
against the opposition of the current president and leaders of the democratic party they have fought to establish and now to expand the dc opportunity scholarship program 
through which thousands of lowincome children have been able to attend a school of their choice and receive a quality education 
dcs republicans have been in the forefront of exposing and combating the chronic corruption among the citys top democratic officials 
we join their call for a nonpartisan elected attorney general to clean up the citys political culture 
and for congressional action to enforce the spirit of the home rule act assuring minority representation on the city council 
after decades of inept oneparty rule the citys structural deficit demands congressional attention 
as the center of our government the district contains many potential targets for terrorist attacks 
federal security agencies should work closely with local officials and regional administrations like the washington area metropolitan transit authority 
a top priority must be ensuring that all public transportation especially metro rails is functioning in the event of an emergency evacuation 
also to ensure protection of the fundamental right to keep and bear arms we call on the governing authority to pass laws consistent with the supreme courts decisions in the district of columbia v heller and mcdonald v chicago cases which upheld the fundamental right to keep and bear arms for selfdefense 
the federal workforce bears great responsibilities and sometimes wields tremendous power especially when congress delegates to it the execution of complicated and farreaching legislation 
we recognize the dedication of federal workers and the difficulty of their thankless task of implementing poorly drafted or openended legislation 
under the current administration the civil service has grown by at least workers while the number making at least has doubled 
at a time when the national debt has increased to over trillion under the current administration this is grossly irresponsible 
the american people work too hard and too long to support a bloated government 
we call for a reduction through attrition in the federal payroll of at least percent and the adjustment of pay scales and benefits to reflect those of the private sector 
we must bring the year old civil service system into the twentyfirst century 
the federal pay system should be sufficiently flexible to acknowledge and reward those who dare to innovate reduce overhead optimize processes and expedite paperwork 
delinquency in paying taxes and repaying student loans has been too common in some segments of the civil service 
a republican administration will make enforcement among its own employees a priority 
and unlike the current administration will name to public office no one who has failed to meet their financial obligations to the government and fellow taxpayers 
the exploration of space has been a key part of us global leadership 
and has supported innovation and ownership of technology 
over the last halfcentury in partnership with our aerospace industry the work of nasa has helped define and strengthen our nations technological prowess 
from building the worlds most powerful rockets to landing men on the moon sending robotic spacecraft throughout our solar system and beyond building the international space station and launching spacebased telescopes that allow scientists to better understand our universe nasa science and engineering have produced spectacular results 
the technologies that emerged from those programs propelled our aerospace industrial base and directly benefit our national security safety economy and quality of life 
through its achievements nasa has inspired generations of americans to study science technology engineering and mathematics leading to careers that drive our countrys technological and economic engines 
today americas leadership in space is challenged by countries eager to emulateand surpass nasas accomplishments 
to preserve our national security interests 
and foster innovation and competitiveness 
we must sustain our preeminence in space 
launching more science 
guaranteeing unfettered access 
missionsand maintaining a source of highvalue american jobs 
we honor the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women of the territories who protect our freedom through their service in the us armed forces 
we welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process 
and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution with all the rights and responsibilities it entails 
us territories face serious economic challenges as they struggle to retain existing industries and develop new ones 
development of local energy options is crucial to reduce their dependence on imported fuel 
and promote economic stability 
the pacific territories should have flexibility to determine the minimum wage which has seriously restricted progress in the private sector 
a stronger private sector can raise wages 
reduce dependence on public sector employment 
and lead toward local selfsufficiency 
all unreasonable economic impediments must be removed including unreasonable us customs practices 
we recognize that congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for puerto rico to achieve a permanent nonterritorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement 
as long as puerto rico is not a state however the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the us government 
we are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they createfamilies schools congregations neighborhoodsto advance their ideals and make real their dreams 
foremost among those institutions is the american family 
it is the foundation of our society and the first level of selfgovernment 
its daily lessons–cooperation patience mutual respect responsibility selfreliance – are fundamental to the order and progress of our republic 
government can never replace the family 
that is why we insist that public policy from taxation to education from healthcare to welfare be formulated with attention to the needs and strengths of the family 
the institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society 
its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation 
it has been proven by both experience and endless social science studies that traditional marriage is best for children 
children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college are physically and emotionally healthier are less likely to use drugs or alcohol engage in crime or get pregnant outside of marriage 
the success of marriage directly impacts the economic wellbeing of individuals 
furthermore the future of marriage affects freedom 
the lack of family formation not only leads to more government costs 
but also to more government control over the lives of its citizens in all aspects 
we recognize and honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the many burdens of parenting alone even as we believe that marriage the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard a goal to stand for encourage and promote through laws governing marriage 
we embrace the principle that all americans should be treated with respect and dignity 
the republicanled welfare reforms enacted in marked a revolution in governments approach to poverty 
they changed the standard for policy success from the amount of income transferred to the poor to the number of poor who moved from welfare to economic independence 
we took the belief of most americansthat welfare should be a hand up not a hand outand made it law 
work requirements though modest were at the heart of this success 
that is why so many are now outraged by the current administrations recent decision to permit waivers for work requirements for welfare benefits 
in other words to administratively repeal the most successful antipoverty policy in memory 
instead of undermining the expectation that lowincome parents and individuals should strive to support themselves benefit programs like food stamps must ensure that those benefits are better targeted to those who need help the most 
for the sake of lowincome families as well as the taxpayers the federal governments entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work 
each year this system dispenses nearly trillion in taxpayer funds across a maze of approximately programs that are neither coordinated nor effective in solving poverty and lifting up families 
for many individuals collecting benefits from multiple categorical programs efforts to work or earn more actually result in less money in their pocket through the resulting loss of benefits 
this poverty trap would ensnare even more americans if obamacare were implemented 
taking a part time job working an extra shift or even just marrying someone who works would result in a loss of benefits thereby discouraging the very acts necessary to achieve the american dream 
families formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation 
we applaud the republican legislative initiatives that led to a significant increase in adoptions in recent years 
and we call upon the private sector to consider the needs of adoptive families on a par with others 
any restructuring of the federal tax code should recognize the financial impact of the adoption process and the commitment made by adoptive families 
the nations foster care system remains a necessary fallback for youngsters from troubled families 
because of reforms initiated by many states the number of foster children has declined to just over 
a major problem of the system is its lack of support financial and otherwise for teens who age out of foster care and into a world in which many are not prepared to go it alone 
we urge states to work with the faithbased and other community groups which reach out to these young people in need 
millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families 
we support the prohibition of gambling over the internet and call for reversal of the justice departments decision distorting the formerly accepted meaning of the wire act that could open the door to internet betting 
the internet must be made safe for children 
we call on service providers to exercise due care to ensure that the internet can not become a safe haven for predators 
while respecting first amendment rights 
we urge active prosecution against child pornography which is closely linked to the horrors of human trafficking 
current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced 
we renew our commitment to the inclusion of americans with disabilities in all aspects of our national life 
in keeping with that commitment we oppose the nonconsensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities including newborns as well as the elderly and infirm 
just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide 
which endanger especially those on the margins of society 
because government should set a positive standard in hiring and contracting for the services of persons with disabilities we need to update the statutory authority for the ability one program a major avenue by which those productive members of our society can offer high quality services 
the individuals with disabilities education act idea has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students 
and we reaffirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers 
we urge preventive efforts in early childhood 
especially assistance in gaining prereading skills to help many students move beyond the need for ideas protections 
we endorse the program of employment first developed by major disability rights groups to replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the american workforce 
the patient protection and affordable care actobamacarewas never really about healthcare though its impact upon the nations health is disastrous 
from its start it was about power the expansion of government control over one sixth of our economy 
and resulted in an attack on our constitution by requiring that us citizens purchase health insurance 
it was the highwater mark of an outdated liberalism 
obamacare has been struck down in the court of public opinion and is falling by the weight of its own confusing unworkable budgetbusting and conflicting provisions 
it would tremendously expand medicaid without significant reform 
leaving the states to assume unsustainable financial burdens 
if fully implemented it could not function 
and republican victories in the november elections will guarantee that it is never implemented 
congressional republicans are committed to its repeal 
and a republican president on the first day in office will use his legitimate waiver authority under that law to halt its progress and then will sign its repeal 
then the american people through the free market can advance affordable and responsible healthcare reform that meets the needs and concerns of patients and providers 
through obamacare the current administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare 
we however affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life 
numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and wellbeing of women and we stand firmly against it 
we believe that taking care of ones health is an individual responsibility 
chronic diseases many of them related to lifestyle drive healthcare costs accounting for more than percent of the nations medical spending 
to reduce demand and thereby lower costs we must foster personal responsibility while increasing preventive services to promote healthy lifestyles 
we believe that all americans should have improved access to affordable coordinated quality healthcare 
including individuals struggling with mental illness 
our goal is to encourage the development of a healthcare system that provides higher quality care at a lower cost to all americans 
while protecting the patientphysician relationship based on mutual trust informed consent and privileged patient confidentiality 
we seek to increase healthcare choice and options 
contain costs and reduce mandates 
simplify the system for patients and providers 
and equalize the tax treatment of group and individual health insurance plans 
for most americans those who are insured now or who seek insurance in the future our practical nonintrusive reforms will promote flexibility in state leadership in healthcare reform 
promote a freemarket based system 
and empower consumer choice 
all of which will return direction of the nations healthcare to the people and away from the federal government 
to return the states to their proper role of regulating local insurance markets and caring for the needy we propose to block grant medicaid and other payments to the states 
limit federal requirements on both private insurance and medicaid 
assist all patients including those with preexisting conditions through reinsurance and risk adjustment 
and promote nonlitigation alternatives for dispute resolution 
we call on state officials to carefully consider the increased costs of medical mandates imposed under their laws which may price many lowincome families out of the insurance market 
we call on the government to permanently ban all federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage 
to achieve a free market in healthcare and ensure competition we will promote price transparency so that consumers will know the actual cost of treatments before they undergo them 
when patients are aware of costs they are less likely to overutilize services 
we support legislation to cap noneconomic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits 
thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of escalating medical bills 
we will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured 
individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous insurance coverage should be protected from discrimination 
we support technology enhancements for medical health records and data systems 
while affirming patient privacy and ownership of health information 
consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform 
todays highly mobile work force requires portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job 
the need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work 
putting the patient at the center of policy decisions will increase choice and reduce costs while ensuring that services provide what americans actually want 
we must end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to purchase insurance across state lines 
while promoting coinsurance products and alternatives to fee for service government must promote health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts to be used for insurance premiums 
and should encourage the private sector to rate competing insurance plans 
we will ensure that americas aging population has access to safe and affordable care 
because seniors overwhelmingly desire to age at home we will make home care a priority in public policy 
we will champion the right of individual choice in senior care 
we will aggressively implement programs to protect against elder abuse 
and we will work to ensure that quality care is provided across the care continuum from home to nursing home to hospice 
we support federal investment in healthcare delivery systems and solutions creating innovative means to provide greater more costeffective access to high quality healthcare 
we also support federal investment in basic and applied biomedical research especially the neuroscience research that may hold great potential for dealing with diseases and disorders such as autism alzheimers and parkinsons 
if we are to make significant headway against breast and prostate cancer diabetes and other killers research must consider the special needs of formerly neglected groups 
we call for expanded support for the stemcell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions– 
with adult stem cells umbilical cord blood and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells–without the destruction of embryonic human life 
we urge a ban on human cloning and on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos 
we support restoring the drug enforcement administration ban on the use of controlled substances for physicianassisted suicide 
we oppose the fda approval of mifeprex formerly known as ru and similar drugs that terminate innocent human life after conception 
no healthcare professional or organization should ever be required to perform provide for withhold or refer for a medical service against their conscience 
this is especially true of the religious organizations which deliver a major portion of americas healthcare a service rooted in the charity of faith communities 
we do not believe however that healthcare providers should be allowed to withhold services because the healthcare provider believes the patients life is not worth living 
we support the ability of all organizations to provide purchase or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious moral or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty 
we likewise support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their children including mental health treatment drug treatment and treatment involving pregnancy contraceptives and abortion 
we urge enactment of pending legislation that would require parental consent to transport girls across state lines for abortions 
americas leadership in life sciences rd and medical innovation is being threatened 
as a country we must work together now or lose our leadership position in medical innovation us job creation and access to lifesaving treatments for us patients 
the united states has led the global medical device and pharmaceutical industries for decades 
this leadership has made the us the medical innovation capital of the world 
bringing millions of highpaying jobs to our country 
and lifesaving devices and drugs to our nations patients 
but that leadership position is at risk 
patients innovators and job creators point to the lack of predictability consistency transparency and efficiency at the food and drug administration that is driving innovation overseas benefiting foreign not us patients 
we pledge to reform the fda so we can ensure that the us remains the world leader in medical innovation 
that device and drug jobs stay in the us 
that us patients benefit first from new devices and drugs 
and that the fda no longer wastes us taxpayer and innovators resources because of bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty 
frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for the average american 
physicians are increasingly practicing defensive medicine because of the looming threat of malpractice liability 
moreover some medical practitioners are avoiding patients with complex and highrisk medical problems because of the high costs of medical malpractice lawsuits 
rural america is hurt especially hard as obstetricians surgeons and other healthcare providers are moving to urban settings or retiring 
causing a significant healthcare workforce shortage 
and subsequently decreasing access to care for all patients 
we are committed to aggressively pursuing tort reform legislation to help avoid the practice of defensive medicine 
to keep healthcare costs low 
and improve healthcare quality 
parents are responsible for the education of their children 
we do not believe in a one size fits all approach to education 
and support providing broad education choices to parents and children at the state and local level 
maintaining american preeminence requires a worldclass system of education with high standards in which all students can reach their potential 
todays education reform movement calls for accountability at every stage of schooling 
it affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations 
it recognizes the wisdom of state and local control of our schools 
and it wisely sees consumer rights in educationchoice as the most important driving force for renewing our schools 
education is much more than schooling 
it is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation 
not just knowledge and skills but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions 
it is the handing over of a personal and cultural identity 
that is why education choice has expanded so vigorously 
as centralizing forces outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake america 
they have not succeeded but they have done immense damage 
since the federal government has spent trillion on elementary and secondary education with no substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates which currently are percent for africanamerican students and percent for hispanics 
the us spends an average of more than per pupil per year in public schools for a total of more than billion 
that represents more than percent of gdp devoted to k education in 
of that amount federal spending was more than billion 
clearly if money were the solution our schools would be problemfree 
more money alone does not necessarily equal better performance 
after years of trial and error we know what does work what has actually made a difference in student advancement and what is powering education reform at the local level all across america accountability on the part of administrators parents and teachers 
higher academic standards 
programs that support the development of character and financial literacy 
periodic rigorous assessments on the fundamentals especially math science reading history and geography 
renewed focus on the constitution and the writings of the founding fathers 
and an accurate account of american history that celebrates the birth of this great nation 
transparency so parents and the public can discover which schools best serve their pupils 
flexibility and freedom to innovate so schools can adapt to the special needs of their students and hold teachers and administrators responsible for student performance 
we support the innovations in education reform occurring at the state level based upon proven results 
republican governors have led in the effort to reform our countrys underperforming education system and we applaud these advancements 
we advocate the policies and methods that have proven effective building on the basics especially stem subjects science technology engineering and math and phonics 
ending social promotions 
merit pay for good teachers 
classroom discipline 
parental involvement 
and strong leadership by principals superintendents and locally elected school boards 
because technology has become an essential tool of learning proper implementation of technology is a key factor in providing every child equal access and opportunity 
the republican party is the party of fresh and innovative ideas in education 
we support options for learning including home schooling and local innovations like singlesex classes fullday school hours and yearround schools 
school choicewhether through charter schools open enrollment requests college lab schools virtual schools career and technical education programs vouchers or tax creditsis important for all children 
especially for families with children trapped in failing schools 
getting those youngsters into decent learning environments 
and helping them to realize their full potential is the greatest civil rights challenge of our time 
we support the promotion of local career and technical educational programs and entrepreneurial programs that have been supported by leaders in industry and will retrain and retool the american workforce which is the best in the world 
a young persons ability to achieve in school must be based on his or her godgiven talent and motivation not an address zip code or economic status 
in sum on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for k public education with overall results that do not justify that spending 
on the other hand the common experience of families teachers and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education 
and congressional republicans are pointing a new way forward with major reform legislation 
we support its concept of block grants and the repeal of numerous federal regulations which interfere with state and local control of public schools 
the bulk of the federal money through title i for lowincome children and through idea for disabled youngsters should follow the students to whatever school they choose so that eligible pupils through open enrollment can bring their share of the funding with them 
the republicanfounded dc opportunity scholarship program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country 
we deplore the efforts by congressional democrats and the current president to kill this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers unions 
we support putting the needs of students before the special interests of unions when approaching elementary and secondary education reform 
because parents are a childs first teachers we support family literacy programs which improve the reading language and life skills of both parents and children from lowincome families 
to ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of american life we support the english first approach 
and oppose divisive programs that limit students ability to advance in american society 
we renew our call for replacing family planning programs for teens with abstinence education which teaches abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior 
abstinence from sexual activity is the only protection that is percent effective against outofwedlock pregnancies and sexuallytransmitted diseases including hivaids when transmitted sexually 
it is effective sciencebased and empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes and avoid risks of sexual activity 
we oppose schoolbased clinics that provide referrals counseling and related services for abortion and contraception 
we support keeping federal funds from being used in mandatory or universal mental health psychiatric or socioemotional screening programs 
we applaud americas great teachers who should be protected against frivolous litigation and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom 
we support legislation that will correct the current law provision which defines a highly qualified teacher merely by his or her credentials not results in the classroom 
we urge school districts to make use of teaching talent in business stem fields and in the military especially among our returning veterans 
rigid tenure systems based on the last in first out policy should be replaced with a meritbased approach that can attract fresh talent and dedication to the classroom 
all personnel who interact with school children should pass background checks and be held to the highest standards of personal conduct 
higher education faces its own challenges many of which stem from the poor preparation of students before they reach college 
one consequence has been the multiplying number of remedial courses for freshmen 
even so our universities large and small public or private form the worlds greatest assemblage of learning 
they drive much of the research that keeps america competitive and by admitting large numbers of foreign students convey our values and culture to the world 
whatever the solution in private institutions may be in state institutions the trustees have a responsibility to the public to ensure that their enormous investment is not abused for political indoctrination 
we call on state officials to ensure that our public colleges and universities be places of learning and the exchange of ideas not zones of intellectual intolerance favoring the left 
college costs however are on an unsustainable trajectory rising year by year far ahead of overall inflation 
nationwide student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt roughly for each of the debtors taking years to pay off 
over percent of recent college grads are unemployed or underemployed working at jobs for which their expensive educations gave them no training 
it is time to get back to basics and to higher education programs directly related to job opportunities 
the first step is to acknowledge the need for change when the status quo is not working 
new systems of learning are needed to compete with traditional fouryear colleges expanded community colleges and technical institutions private training schools online universities lifelong learning and workbased learning in the private sector 
new models for acquiring advanced skills will be ever more important in the rapidly changing economy of the twentyfirst century especially in science technology engineering and math 
public policy should advance the affordability innovation and transparency needed to address all these challenges and to make accessible to everyone the emerging alternatives with their lower cost degrees to traditional college attendance 
federal student aid is on an unsustainable path 
and efforts should be taken to provide families with greater transparency and the information they need to make prudent choices about a students future completion rates repayment rates future earnings and other factors that may affect their decisions 
the federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans 
however it should serve as an insurance guarantor for the private sector as they offer loans to students 
private sector participation in student financing should be welcomed 
any regulation that drives tuition costs higher must be reevaluated to balance its worth against its negative impact on students and their parents 
the most effective forces in reducing crime and other social ills are strong families and caring communities supported by excellent law enforcement 
both reinforce constructive conduct and ethical standards by setting examples and providing safe havens from dangerous and destructive behaviors 
but even under the best social circumstances strong welltrained law enforcement is necessary to protect us all and especially the weak and vulnerable from predators 
our national experience over the last several decades has shown that citizen vigilance tough but fair prosecutors meaningful sentences protection of victims rights and limits on judicial discretion can preserve public safety by keeping criminals off the streets 
liberals do not understand this simple axiom criminals behind bars can not harm the general public 
to that end we support mandatory prison sentencing for gang crimes violent or sexual offenses against children repeat drug dealers rape robbery and murder 
we support a national registry for convicted child murderers 
we oppose parole for dangerous or repeat felons 
courts should have the option of imposing the death penalty in capital murder cases 
in solidarity with those who protect us we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers 
criminals injured in the course of their crimes should not be able to seek monetary damages from their intended victims or from the public 
government at all levels should work with faithbased institutions that have proven track records in diverting young and first time nonviolent offenders from criminal careers for which we salute them 
public authorities must regain control of their correctional institutions for we can not allow prisons to become ethnic or racial battlegrounds 
persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates 
breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are prisoners 
deprived of a parent through no fault of their own these youngsters should be a special concern of our schools social services and religious institutions 
thirty years ago president reagans task force on victims of crime calling the neglect of crime victims a national disgrace proposed a constitutional amendment to secure their formal rights 
while some progress has been made to rectify that situation the need for national action still persists in the unacceptable treatment of innocent victims 
we call on the states to make it a bipartisan priority to protect the rights of crime victims who should also be assured of access to social and legal services 
and we call on the congress to make the federal courts a model in this regard for the rest of the country 
the resources of the federal governments law enforcement and judicial systems have been strained by two unfortunate expansions the overcriminalization of behavior and the overfederalization of offenses 
federal criminal law should focus on acts by federal employees or acts committed on federal property – and leave the rest to the states 
then congress should withdraw from federal departments and agencies the power to criminalize behavior a practice which according to the congressional research service has created tens of thousands of criminal offenses 
no one other than an elected representative should have the authority to define a criminal act and set criminal penalties 
in the same way congress should reconsider the extent to which it has federalized offenses traditionally handled on the state or local level 
we are the party of peace through strength 
professing american exceptionalismthe conviction that our country holds a unique place and role in human historywe proudly associate ourselves with those americans of all political stripes who more than three decades ago in a world as dangerous as todays came together to advance the cause of freedom 
repudiating the folly of an amateur foreign policy and defying a worldwide marxist advance they announced their strategy in the timeless slogan we repeat today peace through strengthan enduring peace based on freedom and the will to defend it 
and american democratic values and the will to promote them 
while the twentieth century was undeniably an american centurywith strong leadership adherence to the principles of freedom and democracy our founders enshrined in our nations declaration of independence and constitution and a continued reliance on divine providencethe twentyfirst century will be one of american greatness as well 
todays adversaries are different as are their weapons and their ideology but this remains the same the unity of americans beyond party in gratitude to those who have defended our country pursued its attackers to the ends of the earth and today stand vigilant guard in our cities on our coasts and in alien lands 
we pledge to our servicemen and women the authority and resources they need to protect the nation and defend americas freedom 
continued vigilance especially in travel and commerce is necessary to prevent bioterrorism cyber terrorism and other asymmetric or nontraditional warfare attacks and to ensure that the horror of september is never repeated on our soil 
our country and its way of life have enemies both abroad and within our shores 
we affirm the need for our military to protect the nation by finding and capturing our enemies and the necessity for the president to have the tools to deal with these threats 
as history has sadly shown even our fellow citizens may rarely become enemies of their country 
nevertheless our government must continue to ensure the protections under our constitution to all citizens 
particularly the rights of habeas corpus and due process of law 
history proves that the best way to promote peace and prevent costly wars is to ensure that we constantly renew americas economic strength 
a healthy american economy is what underwrites and sustains american power 
the current administration is weakening america at home through anemic growth high unemployment and recordsetting debt 
we must therefore rebuild our economy 
and solve our fiscal crisis 
in an american century america will have the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world 
the republican party is the advocate for a strong national defense as the pathway to peace economic prosperity and the protection of those yearning to be free 
since the end of world war ii american military superiority has been the cornerstone of a strategy that seeks to deter aggression or defeat those who threaten our national security interests 
in president reagan came to office with an agenda of strong american leadership beginning with a restoration of our countrys military strength 
we face a similar challenge today 
the current administration has responded with weakness to some of the gravest threats to our national security this country has faced including the proliferation of transnational terrorism continued belligerence by a nucleararmed north korea an iran in pursuit of nuclear weapons rising chinese hegemony in the asia pacific region russian activism and threats from cyber espionage and terrorism 
in response to these growing threats president obama has reduced the defense budget by over billion over the next decade 
and fought republican efforts to avoid another billion in automatic budget cuts through a sequestration in early that will take a meat ax to all major defense programs 
sequestrationwhich is severe automatic acrosstheboard cuts in defense spending over the next decadeof the nations military budget would be a disaster for national security 
imperiling the safety of our servicemen and women 
accelerating the decline of our nations defense industrial base 
and resulting in the layoff of more than million skilled workers 
even the current secretary of defense has said the cuts will be devastating to americas military 
yet the current president supported sequestration signed it into law and has threatened to veto republican efforts to prevent it 
if he allows an additional half trillion dollars to be cut from the defense budget america will be left with the smallest ground force since the smallest number of ships since and the smallest air force in its history 
at a time when our nation faces a growing range of threats to our national security 
and a struggling economy that can ill afford to lose million defenserelated jobs 
the current administrations leaks of classified information have imperiled intelligence assets which are vital to american security 
this conduct is contemptible 
it betrays our national interest 
it compromises our men and women in the field 
and it demands a full and prompt investigation by a special counsel 
equally threatening to the longterm strength and safety of our armed forces are the current administrations efforts to sacrifice our national security for political gain and a partisan agenda 
but he has tolerated publicizing the details of the operation to kill the leader of al qaeda 
those leaks exposed the tactics and techniques of our special operations forces and denied our nation an unprecedented intelligence opportunity 
subsequent leaks by senior administration officials regarding cyber warfare the use of drones against al qaeda and its operatives and the targeting of our enemiesunprecedented leaks that compromised key sources and methods and damaged our national securityserved the single purpose of propping up the image of a weak president 
the current administrations most recent national security strategy reflects the extreme elements in its liberal domestic coalition 
it is a budgetconstrained blueprint that if fully implemented will diminish the capabilities of our armed forces 
the strategy significantly increases the risk of future conflict by declaring to our adversaries that we will no longer maintain the forces necessary to fight and win more than one conflict at a time 
it relies on the good intentions and capabilities of international organizations to justify constraining american military readiness 
finally the strategy subordinates our national security interests to environmental energy and international health issues and elevates climate change to the level of a severe threat equivalent to foreign aggression 
the word climate in fact appears in the current presidents strategy more often than al qaeda nuclear proliferation radical islam or weapons of mass destruction 
the phrase global war on terror does not appear at all and has been purposely avoided and changed by his administration to overseas contingency operations 
that future is here today but it can develop peacefully only under the shield of american naval and air power 
yet the current administration plans to significantly curtail production of our most advanced combat aircraft decommission of air force tactical squadrons and eliminate critical air mobility assets including giant c as and c s while divesting the nation of the brand new c 
the president plans to reduce our naval forces by retiring seven cruisers and slowing work on amphibious ships and attack submarines further reducing the navy that already has the smallest fleet since the early years of the twentieth century 
and he will reduce ground forces by separating soldiers and marinesmany of whom will be discharged after recently returning from combatand another under the sequester 
these plans limit our strategic flexibility in an increasingly dangerous world 
the current president is repeating the disastrous cuts of the postvietnam war era 
putting our nation in danger of returning to the hollow force of the carter administration when the us military was not respected in the world 
we recognize that the gravest terror threat we facea nuclear attack made possible by nuclear proliferationrequires a comprehensive strategy for reducing the worlds nuclear stockpiles 
and preventing the spread of those armaments 
but the us can lead that effort only if it maintains an effective strategic arsenal at a level sufficient to fulfill its deterrent purposes a notable failure of the current administration 
the united states is the only nuclear power not modernizing its nuclear stockpile 
it took the current administration just one year to renege on the presidents commitment to modernize the neglected infrastructure of the nuclear weapons complexa commitment made in exchange for approval of the new start treaty 
in tandem with this the current administration has systematically undermined americas missile defense abandoning the missile defense bases in poland and the czech republic reducing the number of planned interceptors in alaska and cutting the budget for missile defense 
in an embarrassing open microphone discussion with former russian president medvedev the current president made clear that if he wins a second term he intends to exercise more flexibility to appease russia which means further undermining our missile defense capabilities 
a republican president will be honest and forthright with the american people about his policies and plans and not whisper promises to authoritarian leaders 
a strong and effective strategic arsenal is still necessary as a deterrent against competitors like russia or china 
but the danger in this age of asymmetric or nontraditional warfare comes from other quarters as well 
with unstable regimes in iran and north korea determined to develop nucleartipped missiles capable of reaching the united states with the possibility that a terrorist group could gain control of a nuclear weapon it is folly to abandon a missile shield for the country 
the frequency sophistication and intensity of cyberrelated incidents within the united states have increased steadily over the past decade 
and will continue to do so until it is made clear that a cyber attack against the united states will not be tolerated 
the current administrations cyber security policies have failed to curb malicious actions by our adversaries and no wonder for there is no active deterrence protocol 
the current deterrence framework is overly reliant on the development of defensive capabilities and has been unsuccessful in dissuading cyberrelated aggression 
the us can not afford to risk the cyberequivalent of pearl harbor 
the government and private sector must work together to address the cyberthreats posed to the united states 
help the free flow of information between network managers 
and encourage innovation and investment in cybersecurity 
the government must do a better job of protecting its own systems which contain some of the most sensitive data and control some of our most important facilities 
as such we encourage an immediate update of the law that was drafted a decade ago to improve the security of government information systems 
additionally we must invest in continuing research to develop cuttingedge cybersecurity technologies to protect the us 
however we acknowledge that the most effective way of combating potential cybersecurity threats is sharing cyberthreat information between the government and industry 
as well as protecting the free flow of information within the private sector 
the current administrations laws and policies undermine what should be a collaborative relationship and put both the government and private entities at a severe disadvantage in proactively identifying potential cyberthreats 
the costly and heavyhanded regulatory approach by the current administration will increase the size and cost of the federal bureaucracy and harm innovation in cybersecurity 
the government collects valuable information about potential threats that can and should be shared with private entities without compromising national security 
we believe that companies should be free from legal and regulatory barriers that prevent or deter them from voluntarily sharing cyberthreat information with their government partners 
we will honor president reagans legacy of peace through strength by advancing the most costeffective programs and policies crucial to our national security including our economic security and fiscal solvency 
to do that we must honestly assess the threats facing this country 
and we must be able to articulate candidly to the american people our priorities for the use of taxpayer dollars to address those threats 
we must deter any adversary who would attack us or use terror as a tool of government 
every potential enemy must have no doubt that our capabilities our commitment and our will to defeat them are clear unwavering and unequivocal 
we must immediately employ a new blueprint for a national military strategy that is based on an informed and validated assessment of the potential threats we face 
one that restores as a principal objective the deterrence using the full spectrum of our military capabilities 
as ronald reagan proved by the victorious conclusion of the cold war only our capability to wield overwhelming military power can truly deter the enemies of the united states from threatening our people and our national interests 
in order to deter aggression from nationstates we must maintain military and technical superiority through innovation 
while upgrading legacy systems including aircraft and armored vehicles 
we must deter the threat posed by rogue aggressors with the assurance that justice will be served through stateoftheart surveillance enhanced special operations capabilities and unmanned aerial systems 
we will employ the full range of military and intelligence options to defeat al qaeda and its affiliates who threaten not just the west but the community of nations 
we will have a comprehensive and just detainee policy that treats those who would attack our nation as enemy combatants 
we will accept no arms control agreement that limits our right to selfdefense 
and we will fully deploy a missile defense shield for the people of the united states and for our allies 
we will pursue an effective cybersecurity strategy supported by the necessary resources that recognizes the importance of offensive capabilities 
whether it is a nationstate actively probing our national security networks a terror organization seeking to obtain destructive cyber capabilities or a criminal networks theft of intellectual property more must be done to deter defeat and respond to cyberthreats 
we will restore the morale and advance the capabilities of our intelligence community to ensure that the president and our military leaders are fully informed in an uncertain and increasingly dangerous world 
we will restore accountability to ensure that our nations most sensitive information and activities are protected appropriately 
the department of defense like all government agencies needs to be careful to spend taxpayers dollars wisely 
we will implement sound management policies to ensure the timely costeffective delivery of the tools our troops need to fight 
we reject congressional earmarks that put personal and parochial interests ahead of military effectiveness and the best interests of the nation 
we recognize the need for and value of competition within a robust industrial base to most effectively maximize quality and drive down costs in everything the department buys 
the foundation of our military lies in the men and women who wear our countrys uniform 
whether on active duty or in the reserves and national guard and the families who support them 
under no circumstances will we reveal any secret or detail of a military operation that could put our people into additional harms way 
the members of our military should be treated with the utmost respect and dignity 
we reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation 
and will not accept attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness 
consistent with this commitment we believe compensation and conditions for our armed forces in place at the time military service is initiated should be sufficient to attract and retain quality men and women as we honor our promises and commitments to veterans retirees and their families 
these shall continue and not be reduced or otherwise diminished while in service or upon separation or retirement 
the combat readiness of our armed forces is the foundation of strength and deterrence 
readiness requires a consistent and sustained investment in the training and reequipping of our military personnel 
we will never assume the risk of reduced readiness and we can never return to the hollow forces of the s 
combat readiness also requires that we reserve troops for truly necessary operations by not overextending them around the world 
we recognize that drastic cuts to our militarys end strength pose severe national security challenges 
to avoid the overextension of our forces we support a larger active force and oppose cuts to the national guard and reserves 
the allvolunteer force begun on the watch of republican presidents has carried america to victory from the caribbean and central america to the balkans and southwest asia 
we oppose the reinstatement of the draft whether directly or through compulsory national service 
we support the advancement of women in the military which has not only opened doors of opportunity for individuals but has also made possible the devoted and often heroic services of additional members of every branch of the armed forces 
we affirm the cultural values that encourage selfless service and superiority in battle and we oppose anything which might divide or weaken team cohesion including intramilitary special interest demonstrations 
we will support an objective and openminded review of the current administrations management of military personnel policies 
and will correct problems with appropriate administrative legal or legislative action 
the national guard and reserves are a fully operational and battletested component of our armed forces 
many of them have heroically served for multiple deployments resulting in inadequate time between deployments also known as dwell time 
we pledge to maintain their manpower and equipment strength and to ensure their members receive the pay benefits and adequate training to continue their service and maintain mission readiness through presidential leadership and congressional budget support 
their historic and continuing role as citizensoldiers is a proud tradition linking every community across america to the cause of freedom 
we affirm service members legal right to return to their civilian jobs whether in government or the private sector 
and we urge greater transition assistance to and from employers as they return to the civilian world 
especially in light of the high unemployment rates faced by younger reserve and guard members we salute those employers who have wisely decided that it is a smart and patriotic business decision to hire those who have served above and beyond the call of duty 
the spiritual welfare of our troops and retired service members should be a priority of our national leadership 
with military suicides running at the rate of one a day with postservice medical conditions including addiction and mental illness and with the financial stress and homelessness that is often related to these factors there is an urgent need for the kind of counseling that faithbased institutions can best provide 
we support rights of conscience and religious freedom for military chaplains and people of faith 
a republican commander in chief will protect religious independence of military chaplains 
and will not tolerate attempts to ban bibles or religious symbols from military facilities 
we will enforce and defend in court the defense of marriage act doma in the armed forces as well as in the civilian world 
we call upon the entire chain of command from the president and the secretary of defense to base and unit commandersto ensure that our troops and retired service members wherever stationed have the opportunity to vote in the november elections 
and that their ballots will be returned in time to be properly counted 
those who fight for and defend freedom around the world must not be disenfranchised 
the families of our military personnel currently serving retired service members and veterans must also be assured of the pay health care housing education and overall support they have earned 
we will ensure that the federal government keeps its commitments to those who signed on the dotted line of enlistment with the assurance that those promises would be kept 
we must also do more to retain the services of those service members who have borne the fight since 
we must acknowledge that as our troops have experienced repeated deployments so have their families 
we are committed to providing programs that offer readjustment information and counseling to our military families 
and urge states to offer support for job programs license reciprocity onestop service centers and education programs to support these families 
the nation must also recognize the ultimate sacrifice of survivors and protect their benefits 
we will work to protect service members and their families by not overextending their deployments 
america has a sacred trust with our veterans and we are committed to providing them and their families with care and dignity 
this is particularly true because our nations warriors are volunteers who served from a sense of duty 
the work of the department of veterans affairswith a staff of is essential to meet our obligations to them providing health education disability survivor and home loan benefit services and arranging memorial services upon death 
all its branches in those various fields must be made more responsive 
moving from an adversarial to an advocacy relationship with veterans 
to that end we will consider a fundamental change in structure to make the regional directors of the department presidential appointees rather than careerists 
our wounded warriors whether still in service or discharged deserve the best medical care our country can provide 
the nature of the fighting in iraq and afghanistan has resulted in an unprecedented incidence of traumatic brain injury loss of limbs and posttraumatic stress disorder which calls for a new commitment of resources and personnel for its treatment and care to promote recovery 
we must make military and veterans medicine the gold standard for mental health care advances in prosthetics and treatment of trauma and eye injuries 
we must heed abraham lincolns command to care for him who bore the battle 
to care as well for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice who must be assured of meaningful financial assistance remains our solemn duty 
because the conditions of warfare have changed dramatically since the war on terror began todays veterans face new challenges 
asymmetrical or nontraditional warfare results in a high incidence of severe conditions that must receive high priority 
and call for continued research into prevention and treatment 
we are committed to ending homelessness for our veterans 
one key is to assist their reentry into the job market as soon as possible after military service ends 
a job for a veteran is more than a source of income 
it is a new mission with a new status and the transition can be difficult 
it is a national scandal that veterans are one of the groups with the highest unemployment rates 
we urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the many organizations that have specific programs to accomplish this 
but the federal government must take the lead by simplifying the paper work required for a tax break for hiring a veteran 
and by giving vets their assured place at the head of the training and employment line 
every state has an office dealing with veterans 
the federal department needs to consider these as partners in assisting vets recognizing that those closest to the individual can best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy 
this is especially important with regard to the determination of veterans disability claims 
if private insurance companies can deal with car wrecks and hurricanes within weeks or months it is inexplicable that the federal government takes on average a year to process a veterans claim 
since the end of world war ii the united states through the founding of the united nations and nato has participated in a wide range of international organizations which can but sometimes do not serve the cause of peace and prosperity 
while acting through them our country must always reserve the right to go its own way 
there can be no substitute for principled american leadership 
the united nations remains in dire need of reform 
starting with full transparency in the financial operations of its overpaid bureaucrats 
as long as its scandalridden management continues as long as some of the worlds worst tyrants hold seats on its human rights council and as long as israel is treated as a pariah state the un can not expect the full support of the american people 
the united nations population fund has a shameful record of collaboration with chinas program of compulsory abortion 
we affirm the republican partys longheld position known as the mexico city policy first announced by president reagan in which prohibits the granting of federal monies to nongovernmental organization that provide or promote abortion 
under our constitution treaties become the law of the land 
so it is all the more important that the congressthe senate through its ratifying power and the house through its appropriating powershall reject agreements whose longrange impact on the american family is ominous or unclear 
these include the un convention on womens rights the convention on the rights of the child the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and the un arms trade treaty as well as the various declarations from the un conference on environment and development 
because of our concern for american sovereignty domestic management of our fisheries and our countrys longterm energy needs we have deep reservations about the regulatory legal and tax regimes inherent in the law of the sea treaty 
and congratulate senate republicans for blocking its ratification 
we strongly reject the un agenda as erosive of american sovereignty 
and we oppose any form of un global tax 
we oppose any diplomatic efforts that could result in giving the united nations unprecedented control over the internet 
international regulatory control over the open and free internet would have disastrous consequences for the united states and the world 
to shield members of our armed forces and others in service to america from ideological prosecutions overseas the republican party does not accept the jurisdiction of the international criminal court 
we support statutory protection for us personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet our global security requirements 
to those who stand in the darkness of tyranny america has always been a beacon of hope and so it must remain 
that is why we strongly support the work of the us commission on international religious freedom established by congressional republicans to advance the rights of persecuted peoples everywhere 
it has been shunted aside by the current administration at a time when its voice more than ever needs to be heard 
religious minorities across the middle east are being driven from their ancient homelands fanaticism leaves its bloody mark on both west and east africa and even among americas western friends and allies pastors and families are penalized for their religious convictions 
a republican administration will return the advocacy of religious liberty to a central place in our diplomacy 
americans are the most generous people in the world 
apart from the taxpayer dollars our government donates abroad our foundations educational institutions faithbased groups and committed men and women of charity devote billions of dollars and volunteer hours every year to help the poor and needy around the world 
most of which is based on an outdated statist governmenttogovernment model the proven breeding ground for corruption and mismanagement by foreign kleptocrats 
limiting foreign aid spending helps keep taxes lower which frees more resources in the private and charitable sectors whose giving tends to be more effective and efficient 
foreign aid should serve our national interest 
an essential part of which is the peaceful development of less advanced and vulnerable societies in critical parts of the world 
assistance should be seen as an alternative means of keeping the peace far less costly in both dollars and human lives than military engagement 
the economic success and political progress of former aid recipients from latin america to east asia has justified our investment in their future 
us aid should be based on the model of the millennium challenge corporation for which foreign governments must in effect compete for the dollars by showing respect for the rule of law free enterprise and measurable results 
in short aid money should follow positive outcomes not pleas for more cash in the same corrupt official pockets 
the effectiveness of our foreign aid has been limited by the cultural agenda of the current administration 
attempting to impose on foreign countries especially the peoples of africa legalized abortion and the homosexual rights agenda 
at the same time faithbased groupsthe sector that has had the best track record in promoting lasting developmenthave been excluded from grants because they will not conform to the administrations social agenda 
we will reverse this tragic course encourage more involvement by the most effective aid organizations and trust developing peoples to build their future from the ground up 
as we approach the th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation issued by the first republican president abraham lincoln we are reminded to be vigilant against human bondage in whatever form it appears 
we will use the full force of the law against those who engage in modernday forms of slavery including the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the forced labor of men women and children 
building on the accomplishments of the last republican administration in implementing the trafficking victims protection act of we call for increased diplomatic efforts with foreign governments to root out complicit public officials who facilitate or perpetrate this evil 
we highlight the need for greater scrutiny of overseas labor contractors to prevent the imposition of usurious terms on temporary foreign workers brought to the united states 
our government must address the increasing role of vicious drug cartels and other gangs in controlling human smuggling across our southern border 
the principle underlying our megans law publicizing the identities of known offendersshould be extended to international travel in order to protect innocent children everywhere 
we affirm our countrys historic tradition of welcoming refugees from troubled lands 
in some cases they are people who stood with us during dangerous times and they have first call on our hospitality 
international broadcasting of free and impartial information during the cold war kept truth and hope alive in the captive nations 
today radio free europeradio liberty and radiotv marti do the same in other lands where freedom is unknown or endangered 
we support these essential extensions of american values and culture 
and urge their expansion in the middle east 
recognizing the vital role of social media in recent efforts to promote democracy we support unrestricted access to the internet throughout the world to advance the free marketplace of ideas 
we will resist foreign influence in our hemisphere 
we thereby seek not only to provide for our own security but also to create a climate for democracy and selfdetermination throughout the americas 
the current administration has turned its back on latin america with predictable results 
rather than supporting our democratic allies in the region the president has prioritized engagement with our enemies in the region 
venezuela represents an increasing threat to us security 
a threat which has grown much worse on the current presidents watch 
in the last three years venezuela has become a narcoterrorist state turning it into an iranian outpost in the western hemisphere 
the current regime issues venezuelan passports or visas to thousands of middle eastern terrorists offering safe haven to hezbollah trainers operatives recruiters and fundraisers 
alternatively we will stand with the true democracies of the region against both marxist subversion and the drug lords 
helping them to become prosperous alternatives to the collapsing model of venezuela and cuba 
we affirm our friendship with the people of cuba and look toward their reunion with the rest of our hemispheric family 
the anachronistic regime in havana which rules them is a mummified relic of the age of totalitarianism a statesponsor of terrorism 
we reject any dynastic succession of power within the castro family 
and affirm the principles codified in us law as conditions for the lifting of trade travel and financial sanctions the legalization of political parties an independent media and free and fair internationallysupervised elections 
we renew our commitment to cubas courageous prodemocracy movement as the protagonists of cubas inevitable liberation and democratic future 
we call for a dedicated platform for the transmission of radio and tv marti and for the promotion of internet access and circumvention technology as tools to strengthen the prodemocracy movement 
we support the work of the commission for assistance to a free cuba 
and affirm the principles of the cuban adjustment act of recognizing the rights of cubans fleeing communism 
we salute our allies in this fight especially the people of mexico and colombia 
we propose a unified effort on crime and terrorism to coordinate intelligence and enforcement among our regional allies 
as well as militarytomilitary training and intelligence sharing with mexico whose people are bearing the brunt of the drug cartels savage assault 
our canadian neighbors can count on our close cooperation and respect 
as soon as possible we will reverse the current administrations blocking of the keystone xl pipeline so that both our countries can profit from this vital venture 
and there will no need for hemispheric oil to be shipped to china 
pepfar president george w bushs plan for aids relief is one of the most successful global health programs in history 
it has saved literally millions of lives 
along with the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria another initiative of president bush it represents americas humanitarian commitment to the peoples of africa though these are only one aspect of our assistance to the nations of that continent 
from peace corps volunteers teaching in oneroom schools to us seabees building village projects we will continue to strengthen the personal and commercial ties between our country and african nations 
we stand in solidarity with those african countries now under assault by the forces of radical islam and urge other governments throughout the continent to recognize this threat to them as well 
we support closer cooperation in both military and economic matters with those who are under attack by forces which seek our destruction 
we are a pacific nation with economic military and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim from australia the philippines and our freely associated states in the pacific islands to japan and the republic of korea 
with them we look toward the restoration of human rights to the suffering people of north korea 
and the fulfillment of their wish to be one in peace and freedom 
the us will continue to demand the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons programs with a full accounting of its proliferation activities 
their example of material progress through hard work and free enterprise in tandem with greater democracy should encourage their less fortunate neighbors to set aside crippling ideologies and embrace a more humane future 
while our relations with vietnam have improved and us investment is welcomed we need unceasing efforts to obtain an accounting for and repatriation of the remains of americans who gave their lives in the cause of vietnamese freedom 
we can not overlook the continued repression of human rights and religious freedom as well as retribution against ethnic minorities and others who assisted us forces during the conflict there 
we welcome a stronger relationship with the worlds largest democracy india both economic and cultural as well as in terms of national security 
we hereby affirm and declare that india is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner 
we encourage india to permit greater foreign investment and trade 
we urge protection for adherents of all indias religions 
both as republicans and as americans we note with pride the contributions to this country that are being made by our fellow citizens of indian ancestry 
the working relationship between our two countries is a necessary though sometimes difficult benefit to both 
and we look toward the renewal of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict 
the imminent withdrawal from afghanistan of the surge troops sent there two years ago comes weeks before this years presidential election and against the advice of the current presidents top military commanders 
future decisions by a republican president will never subordinate military necessity to domestic politics or an artificial timetable 
afghans pakistanis and americans have a common interest in ridding the region of the taliban and other insurgent groups 
but we can not expect others to remain resolute unless we show the same determination ourselves 
we will expect the afghan government to crackdown on corruption 
respect free elections 
and assist our fight against the narcotic trade that fuels the insurgency 
we must likewise expect the pakistan government to sever any connection between its security and intelligence forces and the insurgents 
no pakistani citizen should be punished for helping the united states against the terrorists 
our relations must continue to be based upon the provisions of the taiwan relations act 
america and taiwan are united in our shared belief in fair elections personal liberty and free enterprise 
we oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the taiwan straits on the principle that all issues regarding the islands future must be resolved peacefully through dialogue 
and be agreeable to the people of taiwan 
if china were to violate those principles the us in accord with the taiwan relations act will help taiwan defend itself 
we praise steps taken by both sides of the taiwan strait to reduce tension and strengthen economic ties 
as a loyal friend of america taiwan has merited our strong support 
including free trade agreements status 
as well as the timely sale of defensive arms 
and full participation in the world health organization international civil aviation organization and other multilateral institutions 
and we will welcome even more the development of a democratic china 
its rulers have discovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth 
the next lesson is that political and religious freedom leads to national greatness 
the exposure of the chinese people to our way of life can be the greatest force for change in their country 
we should make it easier for the people of china to experience our vibrant democracy 
and to see for themselves how freedom works 
we welcome the increase in trade and education alliances with the us 
and the opening of chinese markets to american companies 
the chinese government has engaged in a number of activities that we condemn chinas pursuit of advanced military capabilities without any apparent need
